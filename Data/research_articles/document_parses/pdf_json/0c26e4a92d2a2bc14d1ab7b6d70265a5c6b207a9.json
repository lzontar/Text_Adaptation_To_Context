Effects of the intervention on myocardial strain were examined with a new feature tracking software. Methods and Materials: 20 patients were prospectively included in this study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before and 6 weeks after successful intervention. Myocardial strain analysis was performed using a dedicated feature tracking software (2D CPA MR, TomTec) based on steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine sequences in four-chamber view (4CV) and short axis (SA). Longitudinal myocardial strain was evaluated quantitatively using the timeto-peak (T2P) and peak value analysis. Paired statistical analysis was applied for pre-and post-interventional peak and T2P values for each myocardial segment and average values. Results: 15 patients underwent post-interventional follow-up MRI. In paired strain analysis, arithmetic mean of differences for T2P was 63.3 ms (\u00b1 100, 7 ms), for strain peak values 3.2% (\u00b1 8.2%). Arithmetic mean of differences for peak values in apical segment 17 was 12.16%, in segment 14 apical septal 9.2%. Arithmetic mean of differences for T2P in apical segment 17 was 103.8 ms, in segment 14 apical septal 188.9 ms. Conclusion: MitraClip intervention changes myocardial strain patterns: longitudinal strain T2P was reached 63.3 ms later in post-interventional analysis. However, peak values in longitudinal strain increased, particularly in apical segments. Increased strain values indicate a more effective myocardial contraction after clipping. A slower T2P for all myocardial segments might be due to the afterload is elevated relatively by reducing the regurgitation fraction with mitral clipping.",

Until now, only sparse information is available concerning the outcome of the different surgical approaches like the aortic root replacement (ARR) or the subcoronary implantation (SC) technique. Methods and Materials: 62 consecutive MR examinations of 16 patients with operated severe aortic stenosis were acquired on a 1.5 T MR scanner 7-10 days (early), 3 (middle 1), 6 (middle 2) and 12 (late follow-up) months after ROSS operation. 8 patients (43\u00b111 yrs) had the ARR-technique, 8 patients (49\u00b17 yrs) the SC. Morphometric and functional parameter were acquired by SSFP (cinematography, LGE) and GRE (flow analysis) sequences. Results: Regression of LV mass was observed in all patients (p < 0.01) at early and middle follow-up without difference between both techniques (p= 0.141). Only slight changes of LV ejection fraction were observed without differences between both subgroups. Significant increases of the aortic orifice area were observed in the early and middle follow-up, more pronounced for patients with the SC technique (4.6\u00b11.4 cm2 ARR and 3.1\u00b10.5 cm2 SC early follow-up versus 5.2\u00b11.8 cm2 ARR and 4.0\u00b11.1 cm2 middle follow-up). Mean aortic regurgitation was 11% with a slight increase during follow-up. Mild pulmonary regurgitation was observed in 88% of patients (4.8\u00b13.9 ml for all) without changes during follow-up. Conclusion: We observed significant morphometric improvements in the first year after the ROSS procedure irrespectively of the applied technique. Only mild aortic and pulmonary regurgitation developed. Significant increases of the aortic orifice area were observed.",

Methods and Materials: Ten high-risk AS patients underwent AVB utilising CORREX\u2122. In seven 30-day survivors, flow measurement was obtained using through-plane breath-hold phase-contrast MR sequences acquired in ascending aorta (1 cm above the sinotubular junction), descending thoracic aorta (3 cm proximally and distally to conduit anastomosis) and at ventricular portion of the conduit. MR was performed either before (mean=2.5days; SD=2.4) and after surgery (mean=11.7days; SD=2.14). Post-procedural left ventricular stroke volume (LVSV) was considered either discriminating the two left ventricular outflows and as a sum compared to preoperative LVSV through native aortic valve. Flow gradient (FG) across AVB was finally considered. Results: Average age of patients was 77.4\u00b17.7yo. Average aortic valve area was 0.62 (SD=0.21)cm2. LVSV through AVB was 68%\u00b110% of total. We registered a striking increase in postoperative LVSV even if it did not reach significance cause a too small group of patients.

A total of 50 prostheses were explored including 23 mechanical and 17 bioprosthetic valves. According to echocardiogram, 2 groups were defined: normal (n=27) and PVD (n=23) with 2 subgroups stenotic (n=15) and regurgitant (n=8). Multiplanar analysis of the MDCT dataset of these patients was performed during diastole and systole blinded to the echocardiographic findings. The results were compared to surgical data, when available (n=16). Results: MDCT demonstrated PVD in 29 cases: limitation in the opening/closure of the leaflets (12/2), annular tilting (8), calcification of leaflets (4), protrusive calcification of the ring (7), aspect of suture loosening (12), aspect of thrombosis (2) or pannus (4). MDCT found 22 PVD out of 23 in the PVD group and 6 PVD in the normal group: sub-annular calcifications or pannus (3), perivalvular abscesses (3), pseudoaneurysm (1). In 3 of the \"normal group\" who underwent further surgery, PVD was confirmed. MDCT was abnormal in 11/15 in the stenotic group and 8/8 in the regurgitant group.

The aim of this study was to determine the complementary diagnostic value of cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) to the clinical routine workup including transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (TTE/TEE) in patients with suspected PHV endocarditis and assess its impact on patient treatment. Methods and Materials: A diagnostic prospective cross-sectional study which included patients with suspected PHV endocarditis. Besides the clinical routine workup (including TTE/TEE), CTA was performed to assess its complementary diagnostic and therapeutic value with an expert panel as reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy was determined for PHV endocarditis in general, vegetations and peri-annular complications (mycotic aneurysms/abscesses) with surgical findings or clinical follow-up as reference standard. Results: Twenty-eight patients were included. Addition of CTA to the normal clinical routine workup (including TTE and TEE) resulted in a diagnostic change in six patients (21%) and treatment change in seven patients (25%). Diagnostic accuracy of routine clinical workup plus CTA was superior to clinical routine workup alone for the detection of PHV endocarditis in general, vegetations and peri-annular extension. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that CTA and clinical workup including TTE and TEE are complementary in patients with PHV endocarditis. CTA changes treatment strategy. Therefore, CTA imaging has to be performed after clinical routine workup in every patient with suspected PHV endocarditis.",

This study aimed to determine the impact and reproducibility of excluding trabeculae using semi-automatic software on right ventricular (RV) volumes and function assessed by CMR in patients with pressure overloaded RVs. Methods and Materials: Four groups of 20 patients (pulmonary hypertension, arterial switch operation (ASO), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), systemic RV) and 20 healthy subjects underwent short-axis multislice cine CMR. After manual contour tracing, trabeculae were excluded from the blood volume using semi-automatic pixel-intensity based software. Differences in volumes and function after excluding trabeculae were tested using paired samples T-test. For intra-and interobserver agreement 25 datasets were re-analysed. Results: Exclusion of trabeculae from the blood volume resulted in diminished end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. This led to a significantly larger difference in RV volumes and absolute ejection fraction of patient groups, 4.7 \u00b1 1.6% in PH patients, 6.0 \u00b1 1.5 in ASO patients, 7.2 \u00b1 1.7 in TOF patients, and 10.1 \u00b1 2.3% in the systemic RV group, than in controls (3.4 \u00b1 0.8%). For both methods there was a high inter-and intraobserver agreement in all measurements (correlation coefficients > 0.9; narrow limits of agreement). Conclusion: Exclusion of trabeculae and papillary muscles from the blood volume results in a significant and clinically relevant change in RV volumes, RVEF and RV mass, for patients with pressure overloaded RVs.

Methods and Materials: Twenty-one patients who underwent a CTCA prior to and a CTCA plus an invasive coronary angiography (ICA) after PCI were enrolled. Luminal CTCA opacification was measured in HU at no more than 3 mm proximal and distal to the stenosis or stents borders. Opacification ratio (ORCT) was defined as the ratio between distal over proximal measurements, and were also calculated for two equivalent segments in normal vessels. A mathematical model, accounting for technical variables influencing contrast enhancement, was applied to each scan and compared to true measurements. Pre-and post-treatment ORCT were compared using T-test. Results: Final analysis included 28 stenotic and 16 normal coronary segments. There was significant improvement in mean stenotic ORCT values after PCI (ORCT (pre) = 0.82 (95%CI: 0.75, 0.89); ORCT (post)=0.94 (95%CI: 0.84, 1.0)), p= 0.014.

It enables semi-automatic analysis of enhancement characteristics of the whole tumour (3D analysis of early vs. delayed phase) and the \"hot-spot\" (i.e. voxel with highest washin/washout ratio). Potential of breast MRI characteristics vs. classical prognostic factors to predict disease-related death was investigated separately and in combination using Cox regression. To identify significant and independent predictors for disease-related death, backward feature selection was applied (p entry /removal: < 0.05 /> 0.01). Results: Two-hundred and twenty-three patients were included (disease-related death: n=24/10.8%; censored: n=187/83.9%; loss to follow-up: n=12/5.4%). Mean follow-up was 4.7years. If tested separately, CR analysis identified significant potential both for breast MRI and classical prognostic factors to predict diseaserelated death (p < 0.001). If breast MRI characteristics and classical prognostic factors were used in combination, predictive performance could be further increased significantly (p < 0.05): after feature selection five classical prognostic factors (TNM stage, tumour typing, HER2NEU score) and six breast MRI characteristics (hot-spot: time to peak enhancement, washout ratio; 3D analysis: tumour volume; tumour voxels showing washout plus weak/intermediate washin and tumour voxels showing plateau and weak washin) remained in this final model as significant and independent coefficients (p < 0.05).

The intra-and interday reproducibility was 4.5%, respectively, 1% (PME) 9%, respectively, 10% (PDE), 11%, respectively, 2% (Pi) and 9%, respectively, 3% (\u03b3-ATP). Conclusion: The absolute quantification for large cohort studies has been successfully established on a clinical scanner. The obtained concentrations from this study agree with the concentrations from previous studies. Thus, the current method can reliably detect concentration changes above 10% in phosphorus compounds in human liver. ",

Mookerjee, R. Jalan, S. Walker-Samuel, M. Lythgoe, S. Punwani, S.A. Taylor; London/UK (manil.chouhan@gmail.com) Purpose: Portal venous flow (PVF) measurement using phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) is technically feasible at 9.4T. The purpose of this study was to assess the sensitivity of PC-MRI to expected changes in portal flow after terlipressin administration and study the functional response in normal and cirrhotic rats. Methods and Materials: Eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised to bile duct ligation (BDL) procedure (n=4) or sham laparotomy (n=4). After 4 weeks, PVF was measured using respiratory-gated 2D PC-MRI (2 mm slice thickness, 10\u00b0 flip angle and 22 cm/s velocity encoding) with a 9.4T Agilent system. Terlipressin (known to reduce PVF) was administered intravenously at a dose of 10mcg/100 g and PC-MRI measurements repeated sequentially for 30-40 minutes post-administration. Bulk PVF was normalised to explanted liver weight, obtained after termination of the experiment. Data were analysed using paired and unpaired Student t-tests. Results: Baseline liver weight normalised mean PVF in sham (143.53\u00b114.42 ml/ min/100 g) vs BDL (79.51\u00b144.74 ml/min/100 g) rats was not statistically significant (p=0.059). The reduction in PVF post-terlipressin was significant in sham (mean reduction of 63.48\u00b114.28 ml/min/100 g; p < 0.05), but not in BDL (mean reduction of 55.44\u00b135.71 ml/min/100 g; p=0.053) rats. Significant differences in post-terlipressin nadir PVF in sham (80.05\u00b120.18 ml/min/100 g) vs BDL (24.07\u00b114.66 ml/min/100 g) rats were, however, demonstrated (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Expected reductions in PVF were detected non-invasively using PC-MRI in both normal and cirrhotic rats. Data are suggestive of a lower baseline PVF in cirrhotics, which go on to demonstrate a different, more labile haemodynamic response to terlipressin compared with normal rats.",

Barantin, M.A. Lauvin, X. Cazals, F. Domengie, R. Bibi, D. Herbreteau, J.-P. Cottier; Tours/FR (faisal.gh.30@gmail.com) Purpose: To compare the acute biological effects of a 3.0 Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to 1.5 T MRI Methods and Materials: After MRI examination, 911 patients (449 with 3.0 T MRI and 462 with 1.5 T MRI) were presented with a verbal rating scale questionnaire consisting of 11 symptoms related to MRI examination. Chi-square tests were used to assess the relationship between the strength of the magnetic field (MF) and the incidence of the symptoms. A P value of <.05 was considered significant. Results: There was no statistically significant relationship between the strength of the MF and the incidence of the symptoms related to static MF exposure, such as vertigo (P =.13), nausea (P =.35), headache (P =.21), and a metallic taste (P =.64). A warm feeling induced by radiofrequency (RF) was significantly higher in the 3.0 T MRI (P <.0001) with a significant correlation between the mean specific energy absorption rate (SAR) and a warm feeling in the 3.0 T MRI (P <.0001). Numbness/ tingling related to the gradient MF was significantly higher in the 3.0 T MRI (P =.027). Conclusion: The thermal effect induced by the RF and the numbness/tingling induced by the gradient field were significantly higher in the 3.0 T MRI than in the 1.5 T MRI. There was no statistically significant difference between the symptoms related to static MF exposure from the 3.0 T MRI and 1.5 T MRI.",

Methods and Materials: Brain perfusion measurements were performed in 10 patients as part of an ongoing study investigating the reproducibility of perfusion parameters on a 3 Tesla MR scanner (Siemens Magnetom Verio). Three slices were recorded with a temporal resolution of 2 s by means of a four echo FLASH sequence (TR = 52 ms, TE = 1.2/5/10/15 ms, alpha = 30 \u00bc 70\u00b0). Evaluations of contrast to noise ratios (CNR) during the bolus passage of Omniscan (GE Healthcare) through different tissues were done with an inhouse software written in IDL (Exelis VIS). Results: The CNR is improved by a factor of about 1.8 calculating delta-R2 * from four echoes compared to calculations based on two echos. Signal intensity estimations for TE = 0 do not significantly benefit by the increased number of echoes. Conclusion: Multi-echo measurements allow for a larger dynamic range of T2 * shortening compared to single or double echo sequences, at the same time giving more signal. By extending the concept to keyhole and/or EPI sequences, covering of entire tumours could be achieved. ",

Simultaneous WB-PET/MR scanning was performed at 120 min p.i. of 300 MBq [18 F ]-FDG: 4 min/bed including Dixon Water Fat segmentation (DWFS)). MR-AC was performed using a) original MR-images (DWFS), b) as a) with implant-induced air-pockets filled with soft-tissue, c) as b) superimposed with co-registered endoprostheses from CT and d) as a) with implant-induced airpockets filled with metal. PET reconstruction after MR-AC (a-d) used AW-OSEM (3iterations, 21subsets, 2 mm Gaussian) on 344-matrices. Mean/max standardised uptake value (SUVbw) was calculated from interest volumes with 40% isocontour levels over the hips, pelvic muscle and bladder. Results: In 100 patients we found 1 and 2 uni-and bi-lateral endoprosthesis, respectively. Associated MR artefacts were much larger than the implants: 20.9% versus 2.5% of the attenuating voxels in (a) of the central hip region. MR-AC using (b) and (c) recovered FDG-distribution pattern compared to uncorrected PET (noAC) images and (a), while (d) resulted in severe overestimation (> 470% SUVmax). The relative changes in SUVmax/mean in the reference regions (bladder, pelvic muscle) from (b-d) compared to (a) were insignificantly small. Conclusion: Endoprostheses cause PET/MR artefacts and bias PET quantification. Artefacts and bias can be corrected by automated inpainting with a single softtissue composition prior to MR-AC, thus restoring quantitative activity distribution.",

Two inclusions were harder than the BG and two were softer (44\u00b16 kPa, 75 \u00b1 10 kPa, 12 \u00b1 3 kPa and 18\u00b14 kPa). Protocol was performed using high-frequency linear transducer on four different inclusions. Qualitative assessment was done on elastograms. Semiquantitative measurements were based on the ratio of strain or elasticities between the BG and each inclusion and were compared with theoretical ratio. Quantitative evaluation was performed with SWV techniques. Results: All techniques are adequate when assessing whether or not an inclusion is harder or softer than the BG. Semi-quantitative ratio of stiffness between two structures is not reproducible and strongly depends on the manufacturer. It is more accurate for SWV techniques. Direct quantitative evaluation of stiffness using SWV exhibits biases for soft targets but can still be used to precisely measure stiffness if bias is taken into account. Conclusion: Limitations and advantages of the different elastography techniques must be known while performing an elastography acquisition in clinical practice.",

Laubender, M.F. Reiser, A. Straube, B. Ertl-Wagner; Munich/ DE (Andreas.Pomschar@med.uni-muenchen.de) Purpose: Potential biological effects of static magnetic fields have been in the focus of public debate with the European Physical Agents (Electromagnetic Fields) Directive 2004/40/EC having the potential to seriously limit MR imaging in Europe. Data on potential effects are still very scarce. We aimed to investigate the influence of homogeneous static magnetic fields in 1.5 and 3 Tesla MR scanners on pain and touch perception compared with placebo exposition. Methods and Materials: 18 healthy volunteers (age: 23 \u00b1 1.8 years, 9 females) underwent three experimental sessions on separate days in randomised order, using field strengths of 0T (placebo scanner), 1.5 T and 3 T. Participants were blinded to field strength. No imaging sequences were acquired. In each session, a Quantitative Sensory and Pain Testing programme was performed before and after a 10-min exposure to the static magnetic field. It included thresholds for mechanical detection, mechanical pain, pressure pain, heat pain and phasic heat pain intensity ratings. A linear mixed-effects model was used for statistical analysis. Results: For 1.5 and 3 T compared with the placebo control, statistical analysis revealed no significant effect of the magnetic field for all tested qualities, thresholds for mechanical detection (p=0.82/0.09), mechanical pain (p=0.83/0.53), pressure pain (p=0.97/0.28), heat pain (p=0.53/0.38) and phasic heat pain intensity ratings (p=0.56/0.75).

The detailed analysis of our data allows comparison and Purpose: Detection of abdominal injury is a very important component in trauma management, so an accelerated assessment of liver and spleen injuries including their degree of severity is necessary. There is a good case to believe that in stress situations this subjective performance results in diagnostic mistakes. Structured objective scores as the Organ Injury Scale (OIS) drawn up by the AAST are a valuable guidance for objective trauma assessment. Aim of our study was to evaluate retrospectively whether a structured approach using the OIS differs to real-time-diagnosis. Methods and Materials: The OIS was applied by an experienced radiologist on CT data of 53 patients which underwent CT laparotomy after abdominal trauma. These results were correlated with the original text of the initial CT findings. Finally, we compared both with the intraoperative findings gathered from the surgery report. Results: Regarding the original CT report we found a mean divergence of 0.68 \u00b1 0.8 to the OIS found in the surgery report for liver injuries (0.69 \u00b1 1.17 for spleen injuries). In comparison with the structured approach, where we detected a divergence of 0.8 \u00b1 0.68 (0.47 \u00b1 0.77 for spleen injuries). There was no significant difference, but we detected a lower rate of over-diagnoses in both approaches. Conclusion: A structured approach to abdominal trauma using an imaging checklist does not lead to a significantly higher detection rate, but reduces the rate of overdiagnoses and may be more precise in grading the severity grade plus streamlines the emergeny-CT-procedure.",

We randomised them into distal embolisation group and augmented embolisation group. They were followed up twice by CT at 1 week and 3 months after embolisation. We compared their demographics, injury grades, clinical parameters, hemograms, successful rates and splenic infarct volumes between the two groups. Embolisation failure was defined as persistent hypotension that required surgery or detection of splenic contrast extravasation on follow-up CT. Complication was defined as post-embolisation splenic infarct or splenic abscess. Results: All underwent first follow-up CT, 24 underwent second follow-up CT. Of 26 patients, 17 received distal embolisation, 9 received augmented embolisation. Their basic demographics, CT injury grades, clinical parameters and hemograms did not differ. Their mean systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated after embolisation. Two (2/17, 12%) of the distal embolisation group failed and required a second augmented embolisation. None of the augmented group failed but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The mean splenic infarct volume Purpose: To evaluate whether radiographers' experience in breast imaging helps in reducing significant artefacts when acquiring dynamic breast-MRI. Methods and Materials: One experienced radiologist prospectively evaluated a total of 270 breast-MRI examinations performed by three different radiographers (R1, R2 and R3) over the period September 2011-June 2012 (90 examinations each). R1 had a 5-year experience in breast-MRI and 15 years of experience in breast imaging; R2 and R3 had no specific training in breast imaging, and 5-(R2) and 2-year (R3) experience in breast MRI. For each examination the radiologist, who was blinded to radiographer's experience, was asked to assess the presence or absence of significant artefacts, defined as motion artefacts affecting image quality and/or diagnostic evaluation. The prevalence of significant artefacts in R1, R2 and R3 examinations was tested with the Chi-square test. Results: Significant artefacts were found in 45/270 examinations (16.6%;CI95%=12.7-21.6%). In particular, significant artefacts affected 6/90 examinations (6.6%;CI95%=3.1-13.8%) performed by R1, 22/90 examinations (24.4%;CI95%=16.7-34.2%) performed by R2 and 17/90 (18.8%, CI95%=12.1-28.2%) performed by R3, with a significant difference between R1 and R2 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Artefacts potentially affecting image quality and diagnostic evaluation are less frequent in breast-MRI examinations performed by those radiographers who combine experience in breast imaging with specific experience in breast-MRI. A possible explanation is a better understanding of disease specific problems and of the importance of empathise with the patient.",

Surgery or clinical follow-up was the gold standard for the evaluation of sonographic performance. All examinations were performed using grey-scale graded compression in the left lateral decubitus position. The sonographic criteria for acute appendicitis were detection of a noncompressible, blind-ended, tubular, structure measuring greater than 6 mm in maximal diameter. Results: 4 patients had positive sonographic findings of acute appendicitis (5.9%). Sonographic findings were correlated with surgical findings and clinical follow-up. The diagnosis was confirmed in all 4 patients (100%).

Accordingly, sensitivity was 80.0%, specificity was 100% and overall accuracy was 98.5%. Moreover, in 4 out of the 64 patients with negative sonographic findings for acute appendicitis, a different pathologic finding such as acute pyelonephritis was identified. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that ultrasonographic examination with the optimal study protocol is a highly accurate method for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in pregnant women and should be performed as the first imaging test.",

Methods and Materials: As proof of principle, we used this infrastructure to implement a pipeline for measuring brain volumes in clinical MRI. This fully automated system consists of four steps: subject selection using PACS query, anonymization of privacy sensitive information and removal of facial features, quality assurance on DICOM header and image information, and biomarker extraction. 1114 examinations were selected based on MRI protocol: dementia (246), multiple sclerosis (446) and a general healthy elderly population study (422) . We evaluated the effectiveness of the infrastructure in accessing and successfully extracting biomarkers from routinely acquired clinical imaging data. To prove the validity, we compared brain volumes from dementia and multiple sclerosis patients with the healthy population. Results: Success rates of 82.5%, 82.3% and 100% are achieved for the three protocol groups, respectively, indicating large amounts of routinely acquired clinical imaging data can be used for research purposes. In line with the literature, tive statistics, T-student tests for comparing groups, and Mann-Whitney tests for verifying hypothesis and item relations. Results: Most radiographers completely agree (37.5%) or partially agree (40%) that evidence-based radiology makes part of their job requirements, but only 32.5% consider it absolutely useful for developing their skills. Most research projects and papers (72.5%) are done by radiographers during their degree to develop their knowledge and quality of services rendered. Age and academic degree do not have statistical significance (p < 0.05) for evidence-based radiology; however, there is a slight increase for radiographers with higher academic degrees and for those who have greater access to research papers and literature. Conclusion: Evidence-based practice is not applied by most radiographers as a work method; however, the underlying knowledge on this thematic suggests it would be well received and developed to enhance skill, knowledge and the department general quality.",

Methods and Materials: Twenty-eight patients with suspicion for recurrent PTC underwent 3 T MRI, including DWI (b=0-50-100-500-750-1000 sec/mm 2 ) and DCE-MRI (25 runs; 6 seconds each; pre-, during and post-contrast). Interpretation criteria were: b1000-DWI for detection of soft tissue lesions and lymph nodes (LN); characterisation with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) calculated from all (ADCavg), low (ADClow) and high b-values (ADChigh); characterisation by DCE-MRI with arterial slope (AS), area under the curve (AUC) and c-peak. The ADC and DCE-parameters of tumoural and benign lesions were compared with a Mann-Witney U test. Receiver-under-the-operator-curve analysis determined a threshold from which the accuracy of functional MR-imaging was compared to ultrasound in correlation to histopathology. Results: Only ADChigh and AS showed statistical difference between recurrent tumour and benign lesions (ADChigh: p=0.002; AS: p < 0.0001). Per-neck region, b1000-DWI combined with AS yielded highest sensitivity of 93% with 98% specificity. Ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 98%. Per patient, functional MRI corrected ultrasound in only 4 patients for diagnosing tumour recurrence. However, functional MRI findings correctly changed treatment planning in 13 of 28 patients [excluding tumour recurrence (n=2), mediastinal metastatic LN (n=5), laryngeal metastasis (n=2), ipsilateral nodal skip metastasis to level II (n=2), contralateral nodal metastases (n=2)]. Conclusion: Combining b1000-DWI with DCE-MRI may show additional value to ultrasound for diagnosing and planning treatment in recurrent PTC.",

All patients underwent surgical resection of the tumour and reconstruction with free tissue transfer flap: musculocutaneous, fasciocutaneous, osseous and osseocutaneous. Patients underwent post-operative radiotherapy. In the whole group we performed CT and/or MR study 3, 6 and 12 months after the completion of therapy. In patients suspected for recurrence based on CT/MR findings, MR diffusion-weighted imaging and CT perfusion were additionally performed. In case of positive findings these patients were qualified for surgery. Results: In 11 out of 35 patients imaging study was suggestive for recurrence (4 nodal and 7 local). In this group additional functional imaging was performed. MR DWI and CT perfusion findings were indicative of nodal recurrence in two cases and patients were operated on. Recurrence was not proven on histology in either case. In 7 patients with suspected local recurrence additional functional imaging was performed in 5 cases and the recurrence has been proven histologically in 3 cases. Conclusion: We have to be aware that functional imaging may be of little value in patients reconstructed with free flaps. Although diagnostic imaging plays a prime role in post-treatment follow-up, positive findings must be evaluated with caution. Careful reading together with ENT surgeon is vital.",

The study purpose is to determine differences in airway wall thickness (AWT) and wall area percentage (WA%) between subjects with and without CB symptoms. Methods and Materials: 50 heavy smokers with CB symptoms (cough, mucus, dyspnoea and wheezing) and 50 heavy smokers without CB symptoms were randomly selected from 1,413 participants in a lung cancer screening trial. Airway walls were measured on images in thin-slice low-dose CT with a dedicated software tool, for airways with a luminal diameter \u00b35 mm in 5 selected bronchi (RB1, RB4, RB10, LB1+2 and LB10). Differences in measurements between the groups were assessed by t-test. The association between CB symptoms and AWT and WA% was analysed using multiple linear regression adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking habit, amount of emphysema, and lung function. Results: Mean AWT measured at 5 bronchi was 1.55\u00b10.44 mm and 1.42\u00b10.40 mm in subjects with and without CB symptoms, respectively (P < 0.001). WA% was 47\u00b112% and 43\u00b111%, respectively (P < 0.001). With adjustment for confounders, a significant positive association between both airway wall measurements (AWT and WA%) and CB symptoms was found for airways with a luminal diameter from 5 to 10 mm (P < 0.01). In airways with a luminal diameter \u00b310 mm, no significant association was found (P> 0.05). Conclusion: Patients with chronic bronchitis symptoms have thicker airway walls of airways between 5 and 10 mm diameter, not in larger diameter.",

Automated quantification of global and regional pulmonary PBV was performed using the syngo dual-energy application (Siemens Healthcare). We further quantified the global and regional percentage of voxels with a CT density <-900 HU. Emphysema severity was rated visually and pulmonary function tests were obtained by chart review. Results: Global pulmonary PBV showed a moderate but highly significant negative correlation with residual volume (RV) in % of predicted RV (r=-0.62, p=0.002, n=23) and a positive correlation with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in % of predicted FEV1 (r=0.67, p < 0.001, n=23). Global PBV values strongly correlated with diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO, r=0.80, p < 0.001, n=15). Pulmonary PBV values decreased with visual emphysema severity (r=-0.46, p=0.003, n=40). Moderate negative correlations were found between global PBV values and parenchymal hypodensity in a per-patient (r=-0.63, p < 0.001, n=40) and per-region analyses (r=-0.62, p < 0.001, n=40). Conclusion: DE-CTPA allows simultaneous assessment of lung morphology, parenchymal density and pulmonary PBV.

Thirteen non-decapitated pigs (N-DC) attached to ventilator, supported with conventional treatment served as controls. All were monitored 24h and thereafter examined with chest HRCT. Images were analysed by two radiologists using a pre-defined questionnaire assessing parenchymal and airway changes. In consensus, an overall conclusion inferred presence of edema, infection/atelectasis or airway pathology. Severity was estimated with a subjective scale.

Methods and Materials: 132 CT examinations were carried out in lung transplant patients in full inspiration / expiration using a 64-row MDCT (120 kVp, rotation time 0.8 s, pitch 0.984, collimation 1.25 mm, reconstruction increment 1 mm, standard reconstruction kernel). 27 / 105 examinations were performed in patients with / without BOS (BOS 0: 80, BOS 0p: 25, BOS 1: 11, BOS 2: 5, BOS 3: 11). The assessment of AT was performed using both, a threshold-based method in expiration (HU range: -910 HU to -850 HU) and density mappings of HU values in inspiration and expiration after registration applying a threshold of -910 HU to -750 HU and HU differences \u00b2 70 HU between expiration and inspiration. With both methods, measurements of patients with / without BOS were compared with independent t-test. Results: AT quantified with density mappings was significantly different in patients with / without BOS. Mean AT was 28% in patients with BOS and 18% in patients without BOS. Comparing patients with and without BOS AT might be used for distinction (p=0.002). AT quantified with the standard threshold-based method also showed differences between both groups, but with a lower significance (p=0.019). Conclusion: Measurement of AT with density mappings of HU-values showed a significantly better distinction between patients with / without BOS than the standard threshold-based method.",

Napoli, V. Panebianco, M. Anzidei, F. Boni, V. Noce, L. Bertaccini, G. Cartocci, F. Ciolina, C. Catalano; Rome/ IT (alessandro.napoli@uniroma1.it) Purpose: To assess safety and initial effectiveness of non-invasive high-intensity 3 T MR-guided focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment of localised prostate cancer in a phase I, treat and resection designed exploratory study. Methods and Materials: On the basis of a power analysis, 11 patients with biopsyproven focal T2 prostate cancer (low-to-intermediate risk: Gleason max 3+4), confirmed on a previous multiparametric MR exam, including dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging, underwent MRgFUS. All patients were scheduled to laparoscopic prostatectomy; MRgFUS treatment was carried out on MR identifiable lesions (max 2) using a patient-specific energy and real-time MR thermometry monitor for correct location. Non-perfused volume (VPV) in the post-ablative MRI was than compared with excision pathology for necrosis assessment. Results: No significant complications were observed in all subjects during or immediately after the procedure. Procedure was validated by pathologist that demonstrated extensive coagulative necrosis at the site of sonication surrounded by normal prostatic tissue with inflammatory changes; these features positively compared with immediate post-ablative MRI scan and NPV. At histology 10 patients were free of residual viable tumour within the treated area; in the remaining patient, 10% of residual tumour was observed within the NPV. There was a variable amount of isolated cancer tissue within non-treated parenchyma that was identifiable neither at MRI nor at biopsy. To determine the impact of axial traction during MR imaging of the ankle cartilage at 3.0 T in volunteers with respect to motion artefacts, image quality and cartilage surface delineation. Methods and Materials: Optimised coronal and sagittal T1-weighted (w) turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences with a DRIVE pulse (in-plane spatial resolution 0.21 mm), a sagittal fat-saturated intermediate-weighted (IMfs) TSE sequence and a 3D gradient echo sequence were acquired at 3.0 T in 8 volunteers with and without axial traction of 6 kg. Joint space width was measured at four locations in the tibiotalar joint. Motion artefacts, general image quality, delineation of the cartilage surface, cartilage matrix and the confidence of diagnosing cartilage pathology were evaluated independently by two radiologists. Differences were assessed using a Wilcoxon test. Results: With axial traction, joint space width increased significantly (1.7\u00b10.5 mm vs. 0.3\u00b10.2 mm). Consequently, delineation of the cartilage surface was rated superior in 7/8 volunteers (p < 0.05). No differences were found in motion artefacts, general image quality, and artefacts within the cartilage matrix (p> 0.1). Comparing the different sequences, Cartilage surface and matrix was best visualised by the T1-w TSE sequences with a DRIVE pulse (surface average of all regions and readers in sag T1-DRIVE vs. IMfs on a four-point scale 1.3\u00b10.6 vs. 3.0\u00b11.0, p < 0.05). Conclusion: Axial traction of 6 kg increases the joint space width at the tibiotalar joint, and thus better visualises the articular cartilage surface. Highest spatial resolution and visualisation of both cartilage surface and matrix were achieved by a T1-w TSE sequence with a DRIVE pulse. S188 C A D E F G B Results: All affected subjects were women between 14 and 52 years old (mean age: 40). Ischiofemoral space was significantly narrower in patients with ischiofemoral impingement when compared with control subjects (13.1 \u00b1 4.06 mm vs 24.9 \u00b1 4.55 mm, respectively; p < 0.01). Quadratus femoris space was also significantly narrower in affected subjects (9.4 \u00b1 2.97 mm vs 16.4 \u00b1 1.08 mm; p < 0.01). Inclination angle was not statistically different (p> 0.05). The degree of oedema and fatty infiltration was inversely proportional to values of ischiofemoral and quadratus femoris space. The interobserver agreement (\u0138) was 0.8 for ischiofemoral space, 0.63 for quadratus femoris space and 0.53 for inclination angle. Conclusion: Ischiofemoral impingement can be accurately diagnosed following anatomic and imaging MR criteria.",

Serafini 2 ; 1 Genoa/IT, 2 Pietra Ligure/ IT (chiarapio@libero.it) Purpose: US-guided viscosupplementation is a safe and effective therapy for symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and it allows to replace NSAIDs therapy and to delay prosthetic intervention. Femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) is a cause of OA. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the efficacy of viscosupplementation as therapy of OA in patients affected by femoro-acetabular impingement. Methods and Materials: 352 patients selected by orthopaedists for hip pain and plain films signs of OA (degrees II-IV of K-L) underwent viscosupplementation (4 ml of intermediate weight hyaluronic acid for three times every 30days). Each patient was evaluated before the treatment and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the treatment by means of VAS and Oxford Score. Hence, these patients were divided into responsive (increase Oxford score=/> 10 and/or reduction VAS0/> 3) and non-responsive (increase Oxford score< 10 and/or reduction VAS0< 3). Then we retrospectively evaluated the plain films of the hip these patients had done before the therapy, in order to find the signs of FAI. Results: 281/352 (79.8%) patients were included into the \"responsive\" group; 71/352 (20.2%) in the \"non-responsive\" one. In the \"responsive\" group we found signs of FAI on the plain films of 37/281 patients (11.4%); in the \"non-responsive\" in 43/71 (60.5%). Conclusion: Despite viscosupplementation is an effective therapy of OA, there is an high prevalence of non-responsive among patients affected by FAI.",

Methods and Materials: IRB-approved study involving 51 consecutive patients (22 male, 29 female; mean age 68.8years; range 43-92years) scheduled for total knee replacement. Lower limb length and alignment angles were measured on CT, UFR and 3D models based on BLR using standard and extended length measurements by two independent readers. Measurements of different modalities were compared by paired t-tests, Pearson correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analyses. Results: Mean limb lengths were 783 mm (SD\u00b156.1 mm, range 639-927 mm), 785 mm (SD\u00b153.0 mm, 655-924 mm), 780 mm (SD\u00b155.4 mm, 633-921 mm) and 783 mm (SD\u00b155.9 mm, 636-924 mm) for CT, UFR and 3D models using standard and extended measurements, respectively. Mean alignment angles were 2.3\u00b0 (SD\u00b15.5\u00b0, range -12\u00b0-20\u00b0), 2.5\u00b0 (SD\u00b16.7\u00b0, -17\u00b0-18\u00b0), 3.4\u00b0 (SD\u00b16.6\u00b0, -14\u00b0-18\u00b0), respectively. Length and angle measurements differed significantly when comparing standard 3D models to CT and UFR, respectively (p < 0.001). Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.992, 0.993, 0.995 and 0.998 for limb length and 0.968, 0.983 and 0.984 for angle measurements in CT, UFR and 3D models, respectively. Bland-Altman analyses for CT and UFR compared to 3D models showed a small positive mean difference in length using standard measurements (2.7 mm, SD\u00b15.5; 5.4 mm, SD\u00b113.1) and a small negative mean difference in angle measurements (-1.1\u00b0, SD\u00b12.5; -0.9\u00b0, SD\u00b13.1). No bias for length measurements was seen using extended measurements. Conclusion: Upright 3D models allow for lower limb length and alignment angle measurements comparable supine CT scans and UFR.",

Methods and Materials: 42 patients (27m/15f, mean age 57y) referred for thoracoabdominal staging CT were included in this prospective IRB-approved study. Contrast-enhanced imaging was performed on a 64-slice CT-scanner after oral administration of 3 g effervescent powder immediately before image acquisition. Oesophageal distension was assessed at three levels (proximal/middle/distal) by volumetry of the inner (ID) and outer diameter (OD). Two blinded readers separately evaluated oesophageal distension in the corresponding segments on a three-point scale. At an interval of two weeks, both readers in consensus decided on the number of diagnostic oesophageal segments in each patient in terms of the possibility to decide upon a potentially underlying pathology. Findings were compared with results from a matched control group. Quantitative and qualitative results were compared (T-Test, Mann-Whitney U Test). Inter-observer variability was calculated (weighted-Cohen-\u03ba). Results: ID and OD were significantly larger in all oesophageal segments after effervescent powder administration as compared to the control group (p < 0.05; mean ID: 1.13 vs. 0.14, mean OD: 2.17 vs. 1.26). Further, oesophageal distension was rated significantly better, with a good inter-observer variability (mean weighted \u03ba=0.75). At consensus evaluation, 93 oesophageal segments (74%) were rated as diagnostic in the effervescent group, versus 49 segments (38%) in the control group (p < 0.0001).

The pharmacokinetic parameters of the Tofts model (Ktrans, Kep, iAUC, Ve) were correlated to the clinical outcome at one-year follow-up (n=37). Results: Despite inserted osteosynthesis material, DCE parameters could be evaluated in n=60 at first visit. Sensitivity/specificity of vascularised non-unions as indicator of good clinical outcome was 77.3%/46.7% compared to 95.5%/26.7% using NUSS. Logistic regression revealed non-significant impact of NUSS on clinical outcome (p=0.27, odds ratio=0.97). At first examination, median iAUC (initial area under the enhancement curve) was 24.13 in patients with good outcome compared with 10.96 in non-responders (p=0.032), while Ktrans, Kep, and Ve were not significantly different. Using a receiver operating characteristic analysis, sensitivity/specificity of iAUC at the optimal cut-off value of 17.5 to predict outcome was 68.2%/76.9%. All pharmacokinetic parameters did not change significantly at the one-year control (n=18). Purpose: Imaging-guided thermal ablation has become the therapy of choice among the different treatment strategies of symptomatic Osteoid Osteoma lesions. In this descriptive, prospective study, our objective was to evaluate typical post-procedural MR-imaging characteristics following MR-guided laser ablation of Osteoid Osteoma. Methods and Materials: 35 patients with Osteoid Osteoma treated with MR-guided laser ablation underwent follow-up MR-Imaging immediately after the procedure as well as after 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. Imaging protocol included fatsaturated T2w SPIR TSE, non-contrast and contrast-enhanced T1w TSE images and subtraction images. MR images were jointly reviewed by two radiologists, regarding the appearance of treated areas, nidal enhancement and presence of side effects such as bone oedema and soft tissue enhancement. Imaging was correlated to clinical status. Results: Mean follow-up time was 13.9 months. 28 patients showed a postprocedural target-sign appearance with subsequent \"positive inward fusion\" of the different zonal compartments. Post-procedural MR-imaging can support evaluation of therapeutic success. Characteristic MR findings correlated well with the clinical status. Conclusion: Interpretation of post-procedural follow-up MR-imaging after laser ablation of Osteoid Osteoma may contribute to understanding of histopathological post-therapeutic changes and cornerstones of therapeutic success. S190 C A D E F G B Results: The mean value of Dmax obtained by surgical specimen was 57.45 mm (range 10-250) versus 70.73 mm (range 16-195. 3) of Dmax measured through MDCT. If the Dmax values were stratified into three groups (group 1 smaller than 45 mm, group 2 between 45 and 80 mm, group 3 bigger than 80 mm), a correlation with MDCT results of 62.22, 65.90 and 100%, respectively, was found. Conclusion: MDCT is an accurate technique to obtain an appropriate preoperative definition of Dmax, within the limits of tumour bigger than 45 mm. The revaluation of each case with Dmax smaller than 45 mm will supply additional information about the discrepancy (retraction of the stomach following immersion into formalin, diffusion in the submucosal layer).",

DE (christoph.trumm@med.uni-muenchen.de) Purpose: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or jejunostomy (PEJ) is substantial for patients with swallowing disorders to maintain enteral nutrition or to palliatively decompress intractable small bowel obstruction. Endoscopic placement can be impossible due to previous (gastric) operation, obesity, hepato-splenomegaly, peritoneal carcinosis, inadequate transillumination or obstructed passage. Computed tomography (CT) fluoroscopic guidance with or without endoscopy can enable the placement of a PEG/PEJ if endoscopically guided placement fails. Methods and Materials: 101 consecutive patients were referred to our department for feeding support (n=87) or decompression (n=14). Reasons were: ENT tumour (n=51), oesophageal cancer (n=19), mediastinal mass (n=2), and neurological disorders (n=15). Decompression tubes were placed because of cancer (n=13) or Crohn's disease (n=1). The following approaches were chosen: I. CT fluoroscopy and simultaneous gastroscopy (n=61), II. CT fluoroscopy and inflation of the stomach via nasogastric tube (n=29), and III. direct puncture under CT fluoroscopic guidance (n=11). Results: CT fluoroscopy-guided PEG/PEJ was feasible in 89 of 101 patients. No procedure-related mortality was observed. One tube was misplaced into the colon in a patient with a history of gastrectomy. No complication was seen after removal. Minor complications were dislodgement (n=17), peristomal leakage (n=7), wound infection (n=1), superficial skin infection (n=6) and tube obstruction (n=2). Conclusion: CT fluoroscopy-guided PEG/PEJ is feasible and safe, and provides adequate feeding support or decompression. It offers the benefits of minimally invasive therapy even in patients with contraindications to established endoscopic methods, combining the advantages of both techniques. Long-term complications -mainly tube-related problems -are easily treated.",

Tolan; Leeds/UK (thomas.kaye@leedsth.nhs.uk) Purpose: There is evidence that the quality and extent of colonic resection affects tumour recurrence rates and patient survival. This is currently evaluated by pathological analysis of the resected specimen. Analysis of post-resection arterial stumps via routine follow-up CT could act an alternative in vivo marker. Methods and Materials: Staging and follow-up CT scans from 156 patients with right-sided colorectal tumours were analysed. Pre-operative arterial anatomy and post-operative arterial stumps were demonstrated using multi-planar reformats and volume rendering techniques. Methods of stump identification, stump length and stump orientation were recorded. Results: Ileocolic (98.7%), middle colic (94.2%) and right colic artery (23.7%) identification was comparable with catheter angiogram studies. Mean time interval between staging and analysed follow-up CT was 25 months. Post-resection ileocolic stumps were consistently identified (88.4% of cases). In the vast majority of cases this was via a thrombosed vessel (97%). There was a wide variation in ileocolic stump length (2.5 -74.3 mm, mean 27.6 mm, standard deviation 13.5 mm). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the largest study to date demonstrating arterial stumps post colonic cancer resection. It is the first to consistently identify stumps years after colonic resection using routine surveillance (portal venous) CT. CT-based stump length analysis may therefore have potential as an in vivo marker of extent and quality of surgical resection.",

All catheter insertions and CTE examinations were performed according to department protocol. Small bowel distension was differentiated into four regions (proximal jejunum, distal jejunum, proximal ileum and distal ileum) and given a score from 1 to 3 (1 -< 20 mm, 2 -20-30 mm, 3 -> 30 mm). Results: Distension of proximal and distal ileum was better with BDC than NC (p < 0.05: statistically significant difference). No significant difference was present for others sites (p> 0.05). Conclusion: Our study shows statistically significant better distension of the proximal and distal ileum, with the use of BDC when compared with NC. This is of particular use, as the distal ileum is a common site of small bowel diseases. With better bowel distension, this would suggest that using BDC would help to further improve the accuracy of CTE.",

Rengo, D. Caruso, F. Vecchietti, M.M. Maceroni, G. Silecchia, A. Laghi; Latina/ IT (marco.rengo@gmail.com) Purpose: To evaluate if multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) can be helpful and useful in the decision-making process in sleeve patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms and to demonstrate the reproducibility and accuracy of the technique. Methods and Materials: Twenty-three patients submitted to LSG, complaining upper GI symptoms and/or weight regain and scheduled for a sleeve surgical revision were investigated. All patients underwent MDCT scan, upper GI barium swallow study and endoscopy. MDCT was compared with barium and endoscopy features as concern: oesophageal dilatation, neo-fundus development and volume, hiatal hernia, sleeve size in toto and atrum dilatation. All patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve revision. Surgical findings were considered \"as gold standard\". Results: A total of 21 patients with hiatal hernia, neo-fundus or sleeve dilatation underwent surgical correction. All findings identified at MDCT were confirmed by intraoperative findings. The presence of hiatal hernia was significantly underestimated by both barium and endoscopy with a sensitivity of 57.1% and 50%, respectively (P=0.04, P=0.02). Conclusion: MDCT is an accurate method for the detection of hiatal hernias and quantification of gastric volumes and can be considered as non invasive method to guide surgery. Purpose: The maximum tumour diameter (Dmax) is a prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer, considering its dependence on the depth of invasion. The aim of our work has been to evaluate the accuracy of MDCT in the preoperative definition of Dmax in patients with gastric cancer, assuming surgical specimen measurements as gold standard, in order to obtain a pre-surgery prognostic evaluation. Methods and Materials: Pre-surgery CT examinations of 104 patients (mean age 68.81, range 25-90) with diagnosis of gastric cancer were evaluated retrospectively and in a blind fashion by a radiologist with expertise in the oncologic field. The Dmax measured was obtained through 2D multiplanar curved reconstruction (ADW 4.6 GE Healthcare). The results were compared with macroscopic data after surgery.

FDG-PET is the leading imaging modality for N-staging in lung cancer patients; however, in patients with doubtful FDG-PET status, 3D CT histogram analysis might give an additional value to diagnostic imaging. In this investigation 3D CT histogram analysis was used to identify metastatic lymph node involvement in lung cancer patients in correlation to FDG-PET/CT. Methods and Materials: 38 lymph nodes from 32 patients aged 43-76 years diagnosed with lung cancer were investigated. FDG-PET/CT was performed prior to surgery/biopsy according to clinical schedule. Lymph node assessments were acquired using FDG-uptake and 3D CT histogram analysis on the basis of non-enhanced CT scans. For computing the histograms, the lymph nodes were segmented by a semi-automatic algorithm; the segmentation result was corrected manually if required in certain cases. Both imaging findings were correlated with the results from the histological gold standard study. Results: 21 positive and 17 negative histologically proven lymph nodes were successfully analysed by 3D CT histogram. The histological positive lymph nodes presented a median CT HU value of 34.5 while histological negative lymph nodes presented a median CT HU value of 7.6. Findings were independent of the FDGuptake value. Conclusion: 3D histogram analysis seems to be a very promising and valuable imaging surrogate for N-staging stratification in patients with lung cancer with doubtful glucose uptake in FDG-PET.",

The presence of CD anastomotic recurrence and its phenotype (inflammatory, stricturing, penetrating) , and the presence of inflammatory lesions involving other bowel segments beside the anastomotic site were recorded. Endoscopy and medical records were used as reference standards. Results: CT signs of CD recurrence were detected in 45 patients, including: 32 (71.12%) isolated anastomotic recurrences, 11 (24.44%) anastomotic recurrences + synchronous inflammatory lesions (SILs), 2 (4.44%) inflammatory lesions not involving the anastomotic site.

The aim was to evaluate the correlation between CRP and calprotectin levels and overall small bowel motility in patients with Crohn's disease assessed with MRI. Methods and Materials: 13 patients with Crohn's disease (4f/9m, mean 42y) were included in this IRB-approved prospective study. MRI (1.5-T, Philips Achieva) was performed after a 1-h preparation of 1000 ml Mannitol-Solution (3%). Cine T2w-2D-SSFP motility acquisitions (TR 2.47/TE 1.23/250 ms slice repetition time) were performed in free breathing over 69-84sec. Randomly chosen small-bowel segments were analysed in two abdominal quadrants using dedicated MR-motility assessment software (Motasso). Contraction frequency, amplitude, luminal diameter and amplitude diameter ratio (occlusion ratio, ADR) were evaluated as well as CRP (ngl/ul) and Calprotectin (ug/g) levels. Pearson's correlation was calculated. Results: Calprotectin was determined in mean 12 days (SEM\u00b110.09) before, CRP 15 days (SD\u00b128.80) before MRI.

Djemai 2 , D. Le Bihan 2 ; 1 Kyoto/JP, 2 Gif-sur-Yvette/ FR (mamiiima1@gmail.com) Purpose: To investigate the potential of IVIM MRI to evaluate perfusion and diffusion in a 9L glioma rat brain tumour model using a 17.2T MRI scanner. Methods and Materials: 14 fischer rats were studied. IVIM MRI images were acquired with 72 b values (25 b values; 2 to 160 s/mm\u00b2, 35 b values; 172.5 to 935 s/mm\u00b2, and 12 b values; 1150 to 3025 s/mm\u00b2). The signal attenuation curve was first fitted using a biexponential diffusion model to estimate slow and fast components fraction (fslow, Dfast and Dslow) of the pure diffusion part of the signal (for b> 500s/mm\u00b2). Then, the diffusion component was removed from the signal and the remaining signal was fitted using the IVIM model for b< 200 s/mm\u00b2 to get estimates of perfusion fraction, f, and pseudo-diffusion, D*. Fitting was performed on a ROI basis and on a pixel-by-pixel basis to generate diffusion and perfusion maps. All rats were killed and histology (CD31) was obtained for comparison with IVIM parameters. Results: IVIM maps clearly highlighted areas with high and low fraction perfusion within tumours which were generally heterogeneous, as confirmed by histology. Interestingly, we found a negative correlation between the IVIM perfusion fraction and fslow, suggesting that cell density in high perfused areas is less than in other tumour parts and normal brain tissue.",

Van Purpose: Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy response may be monitored in a noninvasive way using multi-spectral diffuse optical tomography (DOT). A clinically feasible measurement method in these 3D volumes is proposed and compared with previously published whole breast measurements. Methods and Materials: Twelve breast cancer patients were included, which received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Four DOT scans were obtained: before therapy, after 3 and 9 weeks and pre-operative (18 weeks) . Deoxyhaemoglobin (Hb), oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2) and percentages water and lipids were measured in volumes as measured in DCE-MRI scans before therapy, centred on areas of high scattering amplitude and approximate location in pre-treatment DCE-MRI and/ or x-ray mammography. Patients were divided in responders and poor responders based on post-operative pathological assessment. Results: Responders (R) and poor responders (PR) showed statistically significant (P < 0.05) different development of Hb values at 3, 9 and 18 weeks within measurement volumes relative to the first DOT scan: 0.66/1.08 (R/PR, 3 weeks), 0.56/1.07 (9 weeks), 0.55/1.48 (18 weeks) . For HbO2 results were similar, but only significant for 9 and 18 weeks: 0.71/1.03 (3 weeks), 0.53/0.89 (9 weeks), 0.56/1.06 (18 weeks) . Percentages water and lipids were not significantly different. Whole breast measurements did not show statistically significant differences for Hb and HbO2 between responders and poor responders. Conclusion: Using the scatter amplitude to determine the tumour location in DOT volumes enables the measurement of Hb and HbO2 such that these parameters differ significantly between responders and poor responders. This potentially allows effectiveness assessment of neo-adjuvant treatment in breast cancer patients already at 3 weeks.",

Results: Preliminary investigation shows feasibility of semi-automatic segmentation to outline and quantify density distribution in whole tumour volumes. Initial assessment of our set of metastatic lesions suggests that hypervascular sarcomas are a worthwhile study cohort. Histogram shifts appear to correlate with qualitative visual estimates of tumor necrosis whereas RECIST diameters demonstrate little or no differences. Conclusion: Comprehensive tumour analysis using volumetric density algorithms such as TVVT should more accurately reflect tumour burden and trajectory over selective linear or ROI measurements, leading to improved image-based tumour staging and response assessment. Semi-automated quantification of whole tumour burden should decrease inter-observer measurement variability, enabling more convenient, reliable imaging results for multiple contiguous vascular metastases. 0.032).

Punwani; London/ UK (aj372@cam.ac.uk) Purpose: R2* BOLD MRI is proposed as a potential tool for mapping tumour hypoxia in prostate cancer. However, R2* has a complex relationship with tissue oxygenation that remains unexplored in prostate cancer. R2* is the sum of R2 (primarily reflecting tissue structure) and R2' (highly sensitive to static magnetic field inhomogeneities, e.g. from deoxyhaemoglobin). Whilst R2* changes are observed for prostate cancer, they may reflect tissue structure or oxygenation differences. This study aimed to clarify the nature of R2* change by quantifying and comparing R2* and its components (R2 and R2') for cancerous and normal prostate tissue. Methods and Materials: Twenty patients underwent 1.5 T multi-parametric (mp) prostate MRI (DWI, DCE and T2-weighted), supplemented by dual echo-time T2* and T2 quantitation and followed by biopsy. Tumour and healthy regions of interest (identified on mp-MRI and confirmed by biopsy) were contoured in consensus by two experienced observers on matched T2-and T2*-weighted images. Mean R2*, R2 and R2' were calculated and compared between cancerous and normal tissue using the student's t-test. Results: R2* and R2 were significantly greater for cancer than normal tissue (R2*: 18 \u00b1 5 s-1 [mean \u00b1 SD] vs. 13 \u00b1 7 s-1 respectively, p = 0.0130; R2: 11 \u00b1 2 s-1 vs. 6 \u00b1 2 s-1 respectively, p < 0.0001). No significant difference was found in R2' (7 \u00b1 4 s-1 vs. 7 \u00b1 7 s-1 respectively, p = 0.5597). Conclusion: Prostate tumour R2* values predominantly reflect differences in R2 (tissue structure) and not R2' (tissue hypoxia). S194 C A D E F G B men for diagnosis, especially when receptors have to be studied in defining the origin of axillary lymph node metastases. Purpose: Aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of gadofosveset-enhanced MRI for axillary lymph node staging in breast cancer patients. Methods and Materials: Ten women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer underwent both non-enhanced and gadofosveset-enhanced 3DT1-weighted MRI. A radiologist, blinded for clinical data, evaluated all lymph nodes with regard to size, morphologic features and gadofosveset uptake. Lymph nodes depicted on MRI were matched with nodes removed during surgery. Nodal status was investigated by a blinded pathologist. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV values were calculated. Results: A total of 152 lymph nodes were extracted during sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection of which 116 were matched with lymph nodes depicted on MRI. Histopathological examination resulted in 21 macro-metastases and 8 micro-metastases. With contrast-enhanced MRI, 20 lymph nodes were rated as true positive, 83 as true-negative, 4 as false positive, and 9 as false negative. This resulted in an overall node-by-node sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of, respectively, 67% (95% CI 49-80), 95% (95% CI 89-98), 83% (95% CI 64-93) and 89% (95% CI 81-94). If ignoring micro-metastases, MRI showed a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 68-96) and a specificity of 96% (95% CI 89-98). Calculated PPV and NPV were 83% (95% CI 64-93) and 97% (95% CI 90-99), respectively. Conclusion: This feasibility study concerning gadofosveset-enhanced MRI of axillary lymph nodes showed promising initial results. These results warrant larger studies to confirm these promising results. To assess sensitivity and specificity of prone breast 18 FDG-PET-CT for detection of lymph node metastases and to compare it with 3 T CE-MRI of the breast. Methods and Materials: 74 patients with breast cancer were included in this IRB-approved prospective study. All patients underwent 3 T CE-MRI and 18 FDG-PET-CT of the breast in the prone position. Patients were injected with ca. 300 MBq 18 F-FDG. CT data were only used for attenuation correction. In MRI lymph nodes were considered positive for malignancy if there was enlargement > 1 cm, thickened cortex, loss of fatty hilum, matted nodes or an irregular node contour. In PET-CT a lymph node was classified as positive when 18 FDG-uptake was greater than blood-pool activity. The evaluation of nodes was performed on a patient-bypatient basis. All nodes were histopathologically verified. Results: 18 FDG-PET-CT achieved a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 98%. PPV was 0.95 (CI 0.76-0.99), and NPV was 0.91 (CI 0.8-0.96). Diagnostic accuracy was 0.92. CE-MRI had a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 84%. PPV was 0.68 (CI 0.48-0.83) and NPV was 0.88 (CI 0.76-0.94). Diagnostic accuracy was 0.81. 24 nodes were positive and 50 nodes were negative for malignancy. The mean SUVmax of lymph node metastases was 5.52 (range 1.14 -12.75). Conclusion: 18 FDG-PET-CT improves identification of lymph node metastases as compared with 3 T CE-MRI. In patients with lymph nodes classified as malignant by 18 FDG-PET-CT of the breast a sentinel lymph node biopsy can be omitted and surgeons can proceed immediately to ALND.

US-guided FNAB was performed if lymph nodes showed any suspicious findings according to the BI-RADS categorisation: even cortical thickening with preserved hilum, category 4a (C4a); even cortical thickening with compressed hilum or uneven cortical thickening with preserved hilum, C4b; uneven cortical thickening with compressed hilum, C4c; hypoechoic mass with loss of hilum, C5. US and FNAB findings were compared using sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) data. Results: Of 858 patients, 212 (24.7%) showed suspicious nodes on US and underwent US-guided FNAB. Of these 212 patients, 91 (42.9%) showed positive, 112 (52.8%) showed negative, and 9 showed insufficient findings on FNAB. Of 858 patients, 767 patients either with normal axillary US (n = 646) or without positive findings on FNAB (n = 121) underwent SLNB. Of these patients, 169 (22%) had metastatic lymph node. Of 91 patients with positive FNAB findings, 57 underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 34 underwent ALND. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of US were 47.6%, 86%, 60.4% and 79.7%, respectively. The PPV of US was 26.3% in C4a, 67.4% in C4b, 46.4% in C4c, 93 .3% in C5. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of US-guided-FNAB were 71.7%, 100%, 100% and 70.2%, respectively. Conclusion: Axillary US showed high specificity and NPV. A categorisation similar to BI-RADS could be applicable for assessing axillary metastasis in breast cancer patients.",

Methods and Materials: 22 consecutive patients, suspicious or proved to have breast cancer were included, all of them with enlarged lymph nodes and signed the informed consent. The two groups were alternatively sampled by large needle (14G) core biopsy and vacuum-assisted needle (14G) biopsy to obtain 2 cylinders in each procedure. Eleven patients in each group. The size of the sample (weight), as well as the time of the procedure from the injection of anaesthetic to the final collection of the 2 samples was recorded. Discomfort, as well as the acceptance of the method was also recorded and scored in a 4-grade scale. Results: The size of the samples obtained by vacuum-assisted method was bigger than that by core-needle (between twice and three times bigger). But the time for both procedures was similar (always 4-5 minutes). No differences were found in pain or any discomfort and tolerance of the method. Conclusion: Vacuum-assisted axillary lymph node biopsy is a procedure to obtain samples at least as safely as with core-needle biopsy and deserves bigger speci-S195 A C D E F G B Thursday Methods and Materials: 567 breast cancer patients between 2009 and 2011 underwent preoperative AxUS. Suspicious nodes as per protocol were biopsied, negative axillae proceeded to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Patients were stratified based on number of abnormal nodes identified on AxUS (1, 2, > 2 nodes) and the number on final histology was noted. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values for AxUS-FNAC/core biopsy were calculated. Results: 266 (46.9%) patients had positive axillary nodes on final histology with 169 detected by AxUS-FNAC (sensitivity 86.2%, specificity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 68.6%). Patients with nodal metastases identified by AxUS-FNAC had a mean nodal burden of 7.1 nodes on histology (SEM=0.6, 95% CI=5.9-8.3; 1 node identified on AxUS=4.8 nodes on final histology, 2 nodes on AxUS=9.9 nodes, > 2 nodes=9.6 nodes) with correlation between AxUS and histology node numbers (r=0.39, 95% CI=0.24-0.51, p-value< 0.0001).

Methods and Materials: Mammography and breast ultrasound imaging features of 598 early invasive breast cancers were scored according to the 4 th edition of the BI-RADS lexicon, HER-2 status was determined on surgical specimens. Relevant imaging features to predict HER-2 over-expression were first identified by conducting a systematic review and meta analysis, and then applied in multivariable logistic regression models. Results: HER-2 over-expression was found in 80 cancers (13%).

Leong; Singapore/SG (gdrssj@sgh.com.sg) Purpose: To evaluate the performance of elastography in distinguishing benign and metastatic axillary lymph nodes. Methods and Materials: 67 women with 72 sonographically visible axillary lymph nodes undergoing biopsy at our breast imaging centre were evaluated independently with conventional ultrasound, elastography and combined ultrasound and elastography (CEUS). The elastogram was classified as benign or malignant, based on the strain pattern, the length and area ratios of the lesion seen on elastography versus ultrasound. Validation of radiological diagnosis was by histopathology. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of each test were compared individually and with CEUS. To obtain a parameter for diagnostic performance, ROC curves were plotted. Results: Of the 72 axillary lymph nodes biopsied, 33 had metastases and 39 were benign. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of conventional ultrasound were 93.9%, 30.8% and 59.7%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of elastography were 93.9%, 97.4% and 95.8%, respectively, and that of combined ultrasound and elastography were 97%, 92.3% and 94.4%, respectively. The sensitivities of all 3 tests were similar but the specificity and accuracy obtained by elastography and CEUS were significantly better than conventional ultrasound (P < 0.0005). Elastography correctly diagnosed 96% of histologically benign lymph nodes which were deemed malignant on ultrasound. Conclusion: The use of elastography alone or combined with ultrasound has a higher specificity and accuracy than conventional ultrasound in evaluating axillary lymph nodes. Given the high specificity of elastography, biopsy could have been avoided in 96% of cases classified as malignant on ultrasound but benign on elastography.",

Secondary objectives were the evaluation of the safety profile and comparison with contrast-enhanced MRI (CE MRI). Methods and Materials: 25 patients (9f, 16m, mean age: 66y) with known HCC or liver metastases were examined in three centres during a time period of three months. Each patient underwent a baseline and at least three contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) with ascending dose levels (0.25 ml, 1.0 ml, 4.0 ml) of BR14. CE MRI was done 4 weeks prior or post-study examination. Lesions were recorded in on a liver map, with respect to localisation, size and suggested lesion type. Examination quality was documented and safety parameters were assessed. Results: The number of lesions detected with BR14 CEUS increased with dose, while the number of missed lesions and the lesion size decreased. Despite the increasing contrast enhancement no other image quality parameter showed a substantial difference. No significant changes were found for the analysed safety parameters and no serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: We finally conclude that the recommended dose level of BR14 is between 1.0 ml and 4.0 ml for which the lesion detection was comparable to the CE MRI. In addition, we found a higher number of especially small lesions with higher doses of BR14 which might be due to a higher sensitivity of CEUS for the detection of liver metastases. However, this is an interesting and debatable finding. Histopathological characteristics of the primary HCC and recurrence were obtained by a review of the pathologic reports. The association between the variations in histopathological and imaging characteristics of primary and recurrent HCC was estimated using linear regression analysis.",

Methods and Materials: Using standard CT image quality phantoms and an automated quantitative image quality analysis software developed in-house, image quality and radiation exposure (RE) of an MDCT system (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens) either equipped with UFC\u2122 or new \"Stellar\" detectors has been assessed for different combinations of acquisition and reconstruction parameters. Subsequently, measurements and analysis were repeated for \"Stellar\" detectors without altering parameters apart from noise-weighted reduction of tube currenttime product resulting in image noise levels equal to those achieved when using their predecessor. Results: Image noise of both detectors was comparable for small absorption crosssections (\u00d8water=24 cm) while being 18-35% lower for large ones (\u00d8water=40 cm) when using \"Stellar\" detectors. CT number stability and uniformity declined with increasing subject cross-section, particularly at 80 kVp, though not as much for \"Stellar\" detectors. When noise of \"Stellar\" acquisitions was increased to UFC\u2122 levels, RE reduction of 28-54% was achieved. For the \"Stellar\" detector CNR was slightly higher (same RE) or slightly lower (reduced RE), while spatial resolution was always equal for both detectors (up to 20 lp/cm at MTF10%). Conclusion: Overall image quality improves when a next-generation MDCT detector is employed instead of using its predecessor. For acquisition settings intrinsically acteristics (from moderate to poor differentiation), but no association was found between imaging and histopathological variations.",

Variations in dynamic-imaging characteristics of intrahepatic recurrence were not associated with variations in histopathological characteristics. Films strips were scanned before and after irradiation with the Epson Perfection V500 photo scanner in reflective mode. The reference dosimetry system was calibrated in terms of air kerma in air. The measured reflectance change is converted into air kerma using a calibration curve. Air kerma was converted into absorbed dose using the appropriate ratio of mass-energy absorption coefficients water-to-air for a given beam quality, defined by half-value layer following the AAPM TG-61 protocol. Results: Dose values for each of the five CTDI phantom film positions were obtained by averaging dose profiles from each film piece over the length of 10 cm, and were used to calculate weighted CTDIvol. The average difference for six scanners between calculated and listed CTDIvol was 3.9% with a maximum observed difference of 6.9%. Conclusion: In contrast to ionisation chamber measurement, the proposed method requires only a single exposure, does not need stem effect correction, and provides an acceptable accuracy in comparison to CT scanner listed CTDI values. Measured dose profiles allow for measurements of DLP and peak doses at the same time.",

Munich/DE (zsuzsanna.deak@med.uni-muenchen.de) Purpose: To evaluate the dose reduction potential of HIR and IR in comparison with FBP. Methods and Materials: An anthropomorphic cardiac phantom (QRM Corp., Germany) was scanned using a 64-row MDCT scanner (CT 750HD; GE-Healthcare, USA). The phantom's calcification insert was replaced with a model simulating a stented aortic aneurysm with endoleak and intraluminal thrombus. Images were obtained at tube voltages of 120 kV, 100 kV and 80 kV using automated tube current modulation with incrementally increasing noise indices (NI=16, 25, 34, 43, 52, 61, 70) adjusted to a primary reconstruction slice thickness of 2.5 mm. After acquisition, images of 0.625 mm slice thickness were secondarily re-reconstructed with FBP, HIR (ASIR\u00ae with 50% blending, GE-Healthcare) and IR (Veo\u00ae, GE-Healthcare). Twenty-one radiologists blinded to image reconstruction methods independently analysed the detectability of simulated vascular pathologies (endoleaks < 1 cm\u00b2 and intraluminal thrombus < 3 mm). Contrast-to-noise ratio was measured for the stented aorta. A two-by-two Purpose: To compare two low-dose scanning protocols, and to estimate effects on the signal, noise, effective radiation dose (ED), quality of acquired data. Methods and Materials: 90 patients were divided into three groups. The scanning protocol was 120 kVp 200 mAs in first group, 80 kVp 200 mAs in second group, and 120 kV 50 mAs in third group, special reconstruction algorithms have not been used. For quantitative and qualitative evaluation we used visual scores (1-3), mean arterial attenuation, noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in three arterial segments and ED. Results: The BMI ranged from 21 to 38 kg/m2 and were not significantly different between groups (p=0.07, 0.614, 0.297, respectively). The mean intraarterial attenuation in 1, 2, 3 groups was 315\u00b16 HU, 448\u00b176 HU, 334\u00b133 HU, respectively, but significantly higher in second group (p=0.0003). Noise in second group (64\u00b120 HU) was significantly higher than that in third group (45\u00b114 HU, p=0.0002), and first group (29\u00b18.5 HU, p=0.0002). The CNR in second (6.64\u00b12.3) and third (6.36\u00b12.1) groups was significantly lower than that in first group (11.7, p=0.0001). Image quality was comparable between three techniques, except aorto-iliac segment in second group. Effective dose was 27.1\u00b15.9mZv, 8.1\u00b11.8mZv and 6.4\u00b11.02mZv, respectively, differences were significant (p=0.0001). Conclusion: Average radiation dose reduction up to 77% was achieved using \"80 kV\" and \"50 mAs\" protocol providing sufficient image quality. Application of the 80 kV protocol in people with BMI> 30 is limited, especially in evaluation of aorto-iliac segment due to higher noise and attenuation levels. While at 50 mAs protocol such limitation is not observed. This allows to recommend it as the preferred protocol for low-dose runoff CTA in case of special reconstruction algorithms. Purpose: To assess the quality of CT images reconstructed with sinogram affirmed iterative reconstructions (SAFIRE) and comparing their performances with Iterative reconstructions in image space (IRIS) and standard filtered back projection (FBP) algorithms on a Siemens Somatom Definition Flash. Results were used to optimise a dual energy (DE) abdominal protocol. Methods and Materials: FBP, IRIS and the 5 strength levels in SAFIRE (S1-S5) reconstructions were characterised in contrast, noise and spatial resolution for medium-smooth filters using a tungsten wire in air, water and Catphan phantoms. Standard deviation (SD), contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR), noise power spectra (NPS), modulation transfer function (MTF), and the non-prewhitening matched filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNRNPW), a quasi-ideal observer metric in the frequency domain assumed to be the most reliable image quality reference, were calculated for all kernels and used for dose saving evaluations. Results: The highest CNR in DE protocol resulted with a composition factor of 0.6. Compared to FBP, the average SD reductions were 51\u00b12% with SAFIRE S5 and 30\u00b12% with IRIS kernels. A shift towards low frequencies in the NPS was found for all iterative filters, giving to images a different texture. Differences between MTF values were within 5% in all FBP-Iterative coupled filter comparisons. The optimal kernels, from SNRNPW analysis of abdominal protocol, resulted I31-S5 for SAFIRE and I-44 for IRIS with a potential dose reduction of 42% and 30%, respectively. Conclusion: Iterative reconstructions and DE acquisition strongly improve image quality reducing the noise and improving the contrast without affecting the spatial resolution.",

Density measurements were performed on abdominal aorta, renal arteries and common iliac arteries. The radiation dose exposure (dose length product, DLP), the intravessels density and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were calculated, compared and statistically analysed. Results: All exams were considered diagnostic, allowing the correct visualisation of main aortic branch and vascular wall. Higher density measurements were obtained in low-kV protocol: mean attenuation value of abdominal aorta 343 HU, renal arteries 331 HU and common iliac arteries; in comparison to control group: mean value of abdominal aorta 319 HU, renal arteries 294 HU and common iliac arteries 323 HU. A reduction of 65% (p < 0.05) of radiation dose exposure in low-kV protocol (335 DLP; 5.8 CTDIvol) was obtained among control group (973 DLP; 19.4 CTDIvol). Conclusion: Low kV protocol and ultra-low contrast medium volume (40 mL) reduce the radiation exposure (over 65%) and the renal damage, allowing a relevant reduction of contrast material volume, enabling to evaluate more easily young patients or patients with renal failure.",

Methods and Materials: 86 patients underwent CT scanning on HDCT (Discovery CT750 HD, GE Healthcare). All cases were randomised into two groups: standard CTAA (100-120 kVp) with 500 mg/kg per body weight of iodine (n=46) and GSI scanning CTAA (image reconstruction at 50 keV) with the same injection volume as in the standard protocol but composed of contrast medium and saline in a 1:1.5 fashion (n=40).

A five-point scale was used to subjectively evaluate vascular enhancement and image noise. Results: Compared with standard CTAA, GSI CTAA demonstrated higher signal intensity in all aorta arteries (all P < 0.05), inferior noise only in segmental arteries (P < 0.05), higher SNR and CNR (both P < 0.05), and compatible effective dose (P > 0.05). The five-point score was higher in the standard CTAA protocol (P < 0.05). The inter-reader agreement regarding the dichotomized diagnostic versus nondiagnostic scale was similar (P > 0.05) between two groups.

Presence of calcified and non calcified plaques in the arch was used as markers for atherosclerosis. Patients with acute aortic syndromes, connective tissue syndromes and aortitis were excluded. The best systolic and diastolic images were interrogated and true transverse slices were obtained using a 3D workstation. Differences between the systolic and diastolic images for the short axis, long axis and an average of the two were calculated. Results: A total of 135 zones were evaluated in 27 patients. The average variation between diastole and systole diameters was 1. Zone 0 -0.17 mm; 2. Zone 1 -0.0 mm; 3. Zone 2 -0.38 mm; 5. Zone 4 -0.58 mm. Conclusion: While the average variations were well under 1 mm for all zones the maximum was noted in zone 4 (0.58) and the least in zone 1 (0.0). The study shows limited variations in atherosclerotic aortas supporting the theory of reduced expansibility in them secondary to the disease process. This in turn suggest that we need not undertake gated examinations of the aorta prior to endovascular procedures thus avoiding the hazards of radiation. Purpose: To compare low-pitch retrospectively ECG-gated (gated) and high-pitch non-ECG-triggered (non-gated) multidetector CT (MDCT) protocols in terms of measurements of the aortic root and the aortic valve and consequently prosthesis sizing in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). Methods and Materials: 46 consecutive TAVI candidates underwent MDCT examination with retrospectively gated helical scanning of the aortic valve region followed by a non-gated whole aorta CT angiography. Eleven anatomical structures within the aortic root and the aortic valve which are deemed to be crucial for TAVI planning were measured throughout the cardiac cycle and compared with measurements from non-ECG-gated scans. Differences in annular dimensions measured in both types of scans were tested in terms of relevance for prosthesis sizing. Results: Substantial differences in measurements were found for the aortic root at the right coronary ostium level (p < 0.05), the sinotubular junction and the aortic sinuses diameter (p < 0.001). The maximal annular dimensions occur in early systole. Measurements of diameters in high-pitch scans agree only to diastolic images. However, measurements of annular perimeter in non-ECG-triggered highpitch scans agree to systolic images. The highest agreement in prosthesis sizing according to measures from both CT protocols in systole and diastole was noted if annular perimeter was followed. Conclusion: Even though the results of annular perimeter are comparable at first glance, only a dedicated gated CTA protocol offers the full potential to perform all measurements at the optimal time point and should be recommended for prosthesis sizing in TAVI. Purpose: To examine possible relationships between severity of aortic valve calcification, the degree of aortic-valve-regurgitation (AVR) and occurrence of MACE events after transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation (TAVI). Methods and Materials: 58 patients (25 men, 83.3\u00b16.1 years) with symptomatic aortic stenosis were included in this study. 15 patients received a CoreValve\u00ae aortic valve prosthesis and in 43 patients an Edwards SAPIEN\u2122 prosthesis was implanted. Prior to TAVI, all patients underwent a thoracic-pelvine ECG-gated-CTangiography for therapy planning. The aortic-valve calcification score (AS) and aortic-valve calcium volume (AV) was measured and compared to post-procedural AVR measured by echocardiography and to the 30-day incidence of major-adversecardiac-events (MACE).",

The max/min mAs of each subject and their correlation with BMI were investigated to validate whether system could personalise tailor tube current. The chest images were divided into upper, middle and lower parts which were evaluated separately by two radiologists with 3-point scale (3-good, 2-acceptable, 1-poor). Image noise was measured in these parts with 8-mm diameter ROI placed on specific anatomic structures. Effective dose (ED) was compared. . MPR and 3D reconstruction images were created, and reviewed by two experienced radiologists with blinded, who measured the tracheal lumen to determine the presence of central airways narrowing. The 3D reconstruction of confidence was graded on a 4-point scale from 0 (no confidence) to 3 (highest of confidence. The MPR noise was assessed by measuring the SD of the pre-sternal soft tissue. The DLP was used to compare radiation doses. Results: The MPR image noise was ranked higher for CT images of 80 KV protocol than 100 KV protocol. There was no significant difference in confidence between 80KV and 100 KV protocol (P > 0.05). Excessive central airway collapse (reduction > 30%) was seen in 3 patients with tracheomalacia and remaining 13 subjects had centre airway stenosis.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of different arm positioning on automatic tube current modulation of multi-slice CT on chest image quality and radiation dosage. Methods and Materials: Sixty patients underwent scanning by using Care Dose 4D thorax CT protocol in which both arms were raised above the shoulder region using standard-position (Group 1) and postural manoeuver (Group 2), respectively. Objective and subjective image quality was assessed. Individual recorded the CTDIV values and the tube current-time product per exposed section. Effective radiation dose was calculated. Results: Compared with the image quality in the standard-position group, the image quality in the postural manoeuver group was decreased on subjective image quality but within acceptable diagnostic limits. The average effective dose in the postural manoeuver group was 3.37 mSv; the dose in the standard-position was 17% lower than this. Conclusion: Both arms were raised above the shoulder region scanning using Care Dose 4D thorax CT protocol can reduce the overall dosage to patients and the image quality without adverse influences, and may be more feasible in clinical practice.",

Radiation dose and image quality data were gathered from an equal number of CT examinations performed with either sequential (n=20) or spiral (n=20) techniques. Radiation dose data in terms of CTDIvol and DLP were recorded by the scanning radiographers at the end of each examination. A CT brain image evaluation set was compiled which was evaluated by four radiologists. The radiologists evaluated the quality of the images by visually grading the reproduction of anatomical structures as outlined in EUR 16262: European guidelines on quality criteria for CT. Results: Mean CTDIvol and DLP readings were significantly higher (p < 0.05) for sequential scans over spiral scans (CTDIvol: 22.06 mGy vs. 14.94 mGy and DLP: 304.60 mGycm vs. 229.10 mGycm). The mean image quality grading scores for all criteria for the sequential technique were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those obtained by the spiral technique. Conclusion: Spiral acquired CT brain images have lower radiation doses. The quality of the images produced using this technique, however, produces images of a lower quality to those obtained using the sequential technique. Further research is recommended investigating whether the level of image quality produced by the spiral technique is sufficient for diagnosis in order for patients to benefit from associated radiation dose reductions.

Methods and Materials: Using dedicated software (DoseWatch\u00ae), dose information from CT examinations performed on two 64-slice LightSpeed VCT scanners over an 7-month period was prospectively evaluated. We compared the administered radiation doses for 61 equivalent acquisition protocols on the 2 machines, and identified acquisition protocols in which there was a significant dose variation. For these protocols, we performed a rigorous imaging parameter check, including comparison of the number of examinations, acquisition types, number of irradiation events, mA, KVp, scanning length, exposure time and pitch factor. These data were then linked to the protocol setup. Results: We found significant parameter variations in 5 out of 61 CT acquisition protocols. In 4 cases, the variations could not be attributed to a difference in the acquisition protocol set-up, and a thorough inspection did not lead to any improvement. For 1 acquisition protocol (helical skull), we found that the noise index was erroneously configured on one of the CT machines. After correction of this parameter, the median dose length product (DLP) on this machine was reduced from 771 mGy.cm to 446 mGy.cm (42% decrease), based on measurements during 2 months prior to correction (148 cases) and 5 months after correction (364 cases).",

In 70-keV MEIs, CNR in external iliac, femoral and popliteal arteries was higher compared to PEIs (+29%, +19% and +12%; p < 0.05), while CNR did not change in lower leg arteries (p> 0.05). SNR in external iliac and lower leg arteries was equal in 70-keV MEIs and PEIs, while in femoral and popliteal arteries it was lower (-9%, -10%; p < 0.05). 60-keV MEIs showed a higher CNR in lower leg arteries compared to PEIs (+17%; p < 0.05), while SNR did not differ (p> 0.05).

The computer classified the nodules as solid, part-solid or non-solid with an accuracy of 0.72 versus 0.80 for the radiologist. The software reached an accuracy of 0.71 in differentiating part-solid from non-solid nodules, where the radiologist had an accuracy of 0.77. Conclusion: A novel automated characterisation tool for pulmonary nodules shows promising performance and could aid radiologists in selecting the appropriate workup for pulmonary nodules. (19), additional to bled aneurysm (9) and additional coiling (21). Aneurysms ranged in maximal size between 2 and 30 mm (mean/median 9 mm). Aneurysms were located in the cavernous sinus (n=14), supraclinoid internal carotid artery (n=33), anterior communicating artery (n=3), middle cerebral artery (n=2), pericallosal artery (n=2) and posterior circulation (n=17). Patients were preloaded with aspirin and clopidogrel (multiplate test control). Clinical and angiographic follow-up was done at 3-to 12-month intervals after treatment. Results: Single stents were placed in 49 cases, 2 stents in 12 and flow-diverter stents in 10. In 14 cases no additional coil aneurysm occlusion was performed. Seventeen procedural complications occurred (24%): 3 thrombo-embolic, 5 in-stent thrombosis, 3 haemorrhages, 3 side-branch occlusions and 3 technical device problems. Most had no clinical sequel, but 2 patients died (3%) and 5 patients had permanent neurological deficit (7%). Five aneurysms (7%) needed second additional stenting during follow-up. Mean follow-up was 9 months (range 0-39 months). Conclusion: Endovascular intracranial aneurysm occlusion with stent assistance is a delicate procedure with a higher complication rate compared to regular coil occlusion. However, this technique is useful in complex otherwise difficult or untreatable intracranial aneurysms. In-stent restenosis occurred in 9/683 cases (1.3%) and solved with angioplasty in 2/9 cases (22%) or re-stenting in 7/9 (78%). Primary patency rate was 98.7%; secondary patency rate 100%. Neurological events occurred in 3.2% of cases. Results were analysed correlating neurological complications with the operator's experience, plaque morphology and patient's age. Neurological disorders were 1.9 % in asymptomatic patients and 4.5% in symptomatic ones (p=0.001) and they proved to be higher in older patients (> 80y) 6.4% vs 2.7% of patients < 80 years (p < 0.05). The overall neurological adverse events were 6.1% in the presence of complex plaque morphology and 1.0% in case of stable plaques (p < 0.001).",

A total of 91 high signal lesions on DWI were serially numbered and the signal change on conventional MRI in the follow-up was evaluated. The quantitative parameters on DWI (location, volume and value of apparent diffusion coefficient: ADC) for each lesion were measured. We used Fisher exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test to compare differences between two groups; statistical significance was assigned when p < 0.05. Results: There was statistically significant difference in the presence of DWI lesions (multiple: 65% versus single: 100%, p=0.03). In each lesion, the volume was significantly small (0.074\u00b10.019 cm 3 versus 0.149\u00b10.113 cm 3 , p=0.009) and the permanent signal change was less observed in multiple antiplatelets use (5.2% versus 24.5%, p=0.02). There was negative correlation between the volume and the value of ADC (r=-0.48, p <.0001). Conclusion: Periprocedural use of multiple antiplatelet agents is expected to reduce the volume of thromboembolism and permanent signal change in the follow-up. Purpose: The treatment of vertebral split fractures remains controversial, consisting of either corset or internal fixation. The aim of this study was to evaluate CT-and fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous vertebroplasty in the management of vertebral split fractures. Methods and Materials: Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent were obtained for this study. Sixty-two consecutive adult patients who had posttraumatic vertebral split fractures (A2 according to the AO classification) without neurological symptoms were prospectively treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. All these procedures were performed by an interventional radiologist under computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopy guidance using only local anaesthesia. Postoperative outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores. Results: Vertebroplasty was performed on thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. The filling of the vertebral body was satisfactory in 100% of the patients, with seven discal cement leakages (14%).

Methods and Materials: A total of 66 subjects aged 20 -75 (42 women and 24 men) were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups according to the type of procedure they underwent: 36 patients had open surgery and 30 patients had undergone endovascular embolisation. The assessment was performed from 6 months to 4 years after treatment. All patients underwent a follow-up cerebral arteriography and clinical evaluation. Results: A total occlusion or a neck remnant was discovered in a majority of patients following microsurgical procedures and endovascular treatment (94% and 3% in contrast to 87% and 7%, respectively). No recurrent aneurysms were revealed. The Mann-Whitney U test did not reveal any statistical significance in long-term treatment results regarding self-reliance (p-value=0.2). The amount of blood extravasated following the rupture of an aneurysm was a significant independent factor influencing the clinical outcome and determined the long-term results in both groups (p-value< 0.05). A correlation between a patient's age and the clinical outcome following a microsurgical procedure was proved. The outcome was better in younger patients (p-value< 0.05). This was not observed in patients after endovascular treatment. Conclusion: Microsurgical and endovascular therapy are comparable methods for treating cerebral aneurysms; however, embolisation is correlated with a higher rate of complications in elderly patients. The final clinical outcome depends on the amount of extravasated blood following a subarachnoid haemorrhage.",

The aim of this review was to verify the efficacy and safety of hydrogel-coated coils. Methods and Materials: A literature search was performed by two independent researches for papers published up to August 2012 on follow-up results of intracranial aneurysm embolisation with hydrogel-coated coils. Analysis included aneurysm presentation at follow-up compared to initial treatment result, the rate of rebleeding and retreatment, and specific complications. Pooled rates of major recurrences and total recurrences were calculated. Results: Of 41 articles on the use of hydrogel-coated coils for embolisation of cerebral aneurysms, 13 (1575 aneurysms) were included. Significant heterogeneity was found regarding patients populations, methods of aneurysm coiling, follow-up schedules, and recurrence definitions. A cumulative follow-up rate was 76% (95% CI, 74-78%, range 51-100%). Pooled major recurrence rate was 13% (95% CI, 11-15%, range 2-27%) and pooled total recurrence rate was 17% (95% CI, 15-19%, range 3-29%). Control groups consisting of aneurysms treated with bare platinum coils were analysed in only in four articles (436 aneurysms). Pooled major recurrence rate for bare platinum coils was 33% (95% CI, 28-38%) and was significantly higher than this for hydrogel-coated coils. Conclusion: Embolisation of cerebral aneurysms with hydrogel-coated coils results in lower rate of major recurrence, than with bare platinum coils. More high-quality standardised prospective studies are needed to define specific indications for the use of hydrogel-coated coils.",

DixonGASTRO and DixonTIBIALIS were related to visual grading of the MFC (grades 0-4) in both muscles (VisualGASTRO and VisualTIBIALIS). Results: Correlation of MFC derived from MRIDIXON, phantoms and MRS was excellent with correlation coefficient (R 2 ) ranging from 0.93 to 0.99 and mean measurement bias ranging from -0.1 to +0.8%. Mean DixonGASTRO/DixonTIBIALIS was 7.0\u00b14.7/4.9\u00b12.3 in patients and 3.6\u00b10.7/3.6\u00b10.5 in volunteers.

Post-exercise acquisition of spectra started approximately 15 minutes after cycling. Results: Exercise-induced elevations of acetylcarnitine levels were similar in both groups (\u0394post-pre 3.1\u00b11.9 mmol/kg wet weight (ww)). However, post-exercise acetylcarnitine kinetics were significantly different (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: We demonstrate the dynamic character of acetylcarnitine in a situation of changing substrate demand/supply. The current protocol can differentiate between two metabolically different groups, which opens a window towards investigation of acetylcarnitine in relation to metabolic flexibility and insulin resistance.",

Methods and Materials: Human MPCs were isolated from biopsies of the M.rectus abdominis. The MPCs were mixed with a collagen carrier and injected subcutaneously in nude mice. Animals with collagen-only-injections served as controls. MRI was conducted on a 4.7T small-animal-scanner (Bruker BioSpec) at 5 time points between day 3 and 21 post-injection. Relaxometry measurements comprised T1 and T2 measurements using multi-echo-spin-echo (TE 11-99 ms) and saturationrecovery-sequences (recovery time 118-4000 ms) and T2* quantification with a multi-echo-gradient-echo-sequence (TE1 = 4.5 ms, \u0394TE = 7 ms, 12 echoes). Diffusion imaging was performed with a spin-echo-sequence including diffusion gradients with b=0.400 and 800s/mm 2 . Relaxation times and ADC values were measured in the skeletal muscles. Evaluations were performed with custom-made Matlab scripts. Animals were harvested after 28 days and the engineered muscle tissue was assessed by histology, organ-bath and immunofluorescence. Results: Relaxation and diffusion properties of the engineered tissue could reliably be measured at all time points. Relaxometry measurements revealed a decrease of T1, T2 and T2* relaxation-time during differentiation (initial measurement: T1 2242.6 ms\u00b1116, T2:224.3 ms\u00b166, T2*:33.5 ms\u00b14; final measurement: T1:1386.64 ms\u00b188, T2:31.9 ms\u00b14, T2*:10.8 ms\u00b10.8), thereby approaching the physiological relaxation properties of muscular tissue. ADC showed a decrease from 2.24 mm 2 / s\u00b10.26 to 1.51 mm 2 /s\u00b10.05. Cell differentiation and myofibre formation was confirmed by histology, immunohistochemistry and contractility confirmed by organ bath. Conclusion: We demonstrated that MRI relaxometry measurements are able to describe the differentiation of muscle precursor cells. This method might offer the possibility to non-invasively assess the effectiveness of cellular therapies for muscular disorders in near future. Purpose: To evaluate diagnostic accuracy of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in predicting response to neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Cervical lesions ADC were correlated with post-surgical histopathology. Methods and Materials: 24 women (FIGO>IB Bulky) underwent MRI and DWI prior to, after 2 weeks and at the end of nCRT, using 1.5 T scanner. Cervical lesion volume and ADC were measured at each assessment. Radical hysterectomy was performed 4 weeks after MRI. Treatment response was determined based on histopathology and was classified as complete response (CR), residual (RD) or stable disease (SD). Mean ADCs (mADC), ADC increase and volume reduction (VR) rates were compared using histopathology as reference standard Results: According to histology, 13/24 (54%) had CR, 11/24 (46%) had RD < 1 cm. 2 patients presented SD.

Results: In 80 subjects (67%), 114 benign (63.5%) and 6 malign (3.5%) lesions were detected. Six subjects underwent operation (5%) for adrenal carcinoma, renal carcinoma, pancreatic mucinous cystadenoma, intradural schwannoma (2), and enchondroma of the femur. In one subject, tuberculosis pneumonia was detected and medical treatment was given. In 3 subjects focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver, and in one an unclassified solid mass in spleen were encountered and they are in follow-up. The most common incidental lesions were liver cyst (12), liver haemangioma (9), renal cyst (13), and thyroid nodule (6). No significant difference was observed for the incidence of benign and malign lesions between subjects aged \u00b340 years and < 40 years (p=0.209 and p=0.898, respectively).

Methods and Materials: 286 female patients (premenopausal vs postmenopausal: 192 vs 108) with 300 breast lesions were conducted routine ultrasound and elastographic ultrasound preoperatively. The elastic parameters of strain ratio (SR, SR1 was calculated using the same-level and normal-appearing breast region as reference; SR2 was calculated using the subcutaneous fat as reference) were then obtained, with the pathologic diagnosis served as golden standard. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were analysed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with or without the influence of menopause factor.

After 8 weeks of growth, 2 tumours were removed for baseline pathological analysis and 8 were treated by oral chemotherapy during 5 weeks. Ultrasound was performed every week before and during treatment, using a superficial 8-MHz probe. Maximum diameter and mean elasticity value of the tumor were measured. Kinetics of changes in diameter and elasticity before and under treatment were calculated as the slope of diameter or elasticity over time. At the end of the treatment, tumours were removed for pathological analysis. Results: Before treatment, we observed a progressive stiffness increase along tumour growth (slope: 8.8 kPa/week). Under chemotherapy, we observed an early stabilisation of tumour stiffness (slope: -0.8 kPa per week). Furthermore, a significant decrease of elasticity values was seen after four weeks of treatment (p=0.03). We also observed an early progressive decrease of diameter showing that there was a good response to treatment. After five weeks of treatment, we observed modifications of the pathological features of the tumor, i.e. mainly a decrease of cellular density. Conclusion: In our model, we observed an early stabilisation of tumour elasticity with an inversion of elasticity slope under treatment showing that SWE could be an interesting tool to assess early tumor response to chemotherapy.

Purpose: The purpose of our study was to investigate arterial spin labelling (ASL) MRI for functional assessment of transplanted kidneys at 1.5 T and 3 T. Methods and Materials: 105 renal allograft recipients (mean age 50.8 \u00b1 14.7 years) were included in this study. ASL MRI was performed at 1.5 T (n=71) and 3 T (n=34) using a single-slice paracoronal FAIR TrueFisp sequence (30 averages, inversion time 1200 ms, slice thickness 8 mm, matrix 128 x 128). For quantification of ASL perfusion, T1 relaxation times were determined at 1.5 T and 3 T using the variable flip angle approach. ROIs were drawn by a single reviewer on ASL parameter maps for quantification of cortical perfusion. ASL perfusion was correlated with allograft function as determined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and compared between patients with good or moderate allograft function (group a; eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2) and patients with heavily impaired allograft function (group b; eGFR \u00b2 30 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2). Results: ASL perfusion and eGFR were comparable at 1.5 T (36.1 \u00b1 22.6 ml/ min/1.73 m\u00b2 and 237 \u00b1 101 ml/100 g/min) and 3 T (42.3 \u00b1 22.2 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2 and 248 \u00b1 66 ml/100 g/min). ASL perfusion was significantly higher in group a (283.9 \u00b1 59.4 ml/100 g/min) as compared to group b (195.6 \u00b1 62.0 ml/100 g/min) (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion: DWI of the kidneys seems to be highly sensitive for the detection of infections within the kidney. Purpose: To investigate feasibility dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI assessment of kidney function and renal masses on a single slice compared with investigation of the whole organ or tumour. Methods and Materials: Fourteen patients with renal tumours (11 renal cell carcinomas, 2 angiomyolipoma, 1 oncocytoma) before and after partial nephrectomy underwent DCE-MRI at 3 T (Magnetom VERIO, Siemens Healthcare Sector) with a time-resolved angiography with stochastic trajectories (TWIST)-sequence (voxelsize 2.6x2.6x2.6 mm 3 , temporal resolution 2.5 mm) with half-dose Gadobutrol (Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals). 28 kidney datasets and 14 tumour datasets were assessed using in-house built IDL-software PMI 0.4. Using 2-compartment-models with semi-automated segmentation, renal perfusion and filtration as well as tumour perfusion and permeability were calculated for a single central Region-of-interest on a single slice or the whole organ or tumour. Statistical analysis was performed with paired t-tests and Pearson\u00b4s correlation coefficient. Results: There were no significant differences between single slice / whole kidney (plasma-flow 275.8\u00b1105.6 vs. 234\u00b196.7 ml/100 ml/min, plasma-volume 28.2\u00b18.9 vs. 25.0\u00b19.0 ml/100 ml, glomerular-filtration-rate 16.9\u00b19.2 vs. 15.9\u00b18.0 ml/100 ml/ min) as well as between single slice/ whole tumour (plasma-flow 122.5\u00b185.6 vs. 120.5\u00b195.2 ml/100 ml/min, plasma-volume 18.9 vs. 13.0 ml/100 ml and permeabilitysurface-product 5.4\u00b17.9 vs. 5.4\u00b18.3 ml/100 ml/min). Correlations between single slice and whole organ/ tumour was were excellent and significant for all parameters (r = 0.95 to 0.99, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Single slice assessment of kidney function and renal masses with DCE-MRI does not show significant differences to the more time-consuming analysis of the whole organ/ tumour. Incorporation of single slice analysis of DCE-MRI data in future studies appears feasible and justifiable.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate MR renography and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for assessment of this novel chemokine-directed therapy in an experimental murine animal model. Methods and Materials: An orthotopic renal transplant mouse-model with acute allograft rejection (balb/c into C57/BL6) was used. 5 animals were treated with low-dose cyclosporin A in combination with mNOX. 7 animals did not receive treatment. 3 syngenic controls (C57/BL6 into C57/BL6) were performed. Imaging was conducted at 3 T with a dedicated mouse coil. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed with b values ranging 0 to 800 s/mm2. MR renography was performed with a TWIST-sequence with a temporal resolution of 1.5 seconds following a bolus of 10\u00b5l gadobutrol in 100\u00b5l NaCl. Significance between subgroups was assessed with Wilcoxon\u00b4s rank-sum test. Results: Syngenic allograft showed substantially higher plasma flow (53.2\u00b117.2 ml/100 ml/min) and significantly lower (p < 0.05) ADC (1.20\u00b10.02 mm2/s) than native kidneys (44.1\u00b17.1 ml/100 ml/min and 1.29\u00b10.09 mm2/s).

Main diffusion directions reflecting the fibre orientation were determined using a Sense-SSEPI with diffusion-sensitised gradients (b600 mm2s-1) along 16 directions. A deterministic bre-tracking algorithm was used to show fibre architecture, compared with anatomic atlas. Three ROIs were placed at different levels of the spinal cord nerves: one in the middle of each tract-of-interest, accompanied by \"AND\" selection ROIs at both ends of the nerve tract ROI. Diffusion-weighted Ssh-EPI images are processed on a dedicated workstation for data pre-processing with MedINRIA deterministic software. Results: Tractography of the sacral plexus was feasible for all 10 volunteers, giving 3D insight into the general anatomy and organisation of the nerves L4 to S4. Main artefacts in fibre reconstruction, caused by bladder over-distension, by presence of air in rectum and by constant small movements due to breathing and/or spontaneous contractions of pelvic organs, never invalidate the feasibility of tractography. Fibres were reconstructed from medulla to the pelvic course of main branches of sacral-plexus nerves. Emerging branches of pudendal nerve were found in 6 volunteers.

Sugimura 1 ; 1 Kobe/JP, 2 Otawara/JP, 3 Osaka/JP (staka@med.kobe-u.ac.jp) Purpose: To assess the value of ASL-perfusion MRI for the prostate using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) study findings as the reference standard. Methods and Materials: 22 male patients (mean age 69.2 \u00b1 7.6 years) with suspected prostate cancer were prospectively included in this study. Single-slice 2D-pulsed ASL images were acquired during our routine prostate screening protocol on a 3 T MRI unit, including the DCE study. First, ROI was drawn for the obturator muscle on a control image of ASL sequence (Scont.ref). Then, ROIs were drawn for the femoral artery, the obturator muscle, the normal PZ and the regions where DCE showed early enhancement on the tagged ASL image. These values were divided with Scont.ref, yielding an ASL ratio (ASLR). Analysis of the variance was performed to assess differences in ASLR for each tissue or region. A radiologist scored the degree of enhancement on DCE and compare to the contrast ratio of ASLR and the visual assessment of ASL signals. Results: A mean ASLR of the femoral artery was 15.8\u00b16.9%, where those of the normal PZ and the obturator muscle were 0.6\u00b10.5%, and 0.6\u00b10.5%, respectively. On the other hand, the enhanced regions on DCE showed a mean ASLR of 0.98\u00b11.0%. Visual assessment of the ASL image detected 7 out of 12 well-enhanced regions. Contrast ratio of ASLR demonstrated significant positive correlation to the degree of enhancement on DCE (Spearman; r=0.54, p=.007). Conclusion: ASL may allow detecting the region of the higher tissue blood flow in the prostate without contrast materials. Purpose: Aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of contrast-enhanced 7 Tesla MRI of the female pelvis. Methods and Materials: 10 healthy female volunteers were examined on a 7T whole body MR system (Magnetom 7T, Siemens) utilising an 8-channel transmit/ receive radiofrequency body coil. The examination protocol included 1) T1w fs 2D FLASH, 2) dynamic T1w fs 3D FLASH, 3) T2w TSE sequences. For qualitative image analysis of T1w MRI, the delineation of pelvic anatomy, pelvis vasculature, tissue contrast and overall image quality was assessed and for T2w MRI the zonal anatomy of the uterus and the conspicuity of the ovaries were evaluated (fivepoint-scale analysis: 5 = excellent to 1 = non-diagnostic). Image impairment due to various artefacts was assessed. Contrast ratios between junctional zone and myometrium were obtained via ROI analysis for T2w MRI. Results: Of all three sequences, 2D FLASH MRI offered best overall image quality (mean contrast-enhanced 4.75) and highest tissue contrast (mean contrastenhanced 4.92). For the T1w sequences, 2D FLASH imaging was rated with higher scores for all assessed structures than 3D FLASH MRI. T2w TSE imaging provided a moderate to high conspicuity of the zonal anatomy of the uterus with mean scores ranging from 3.5 for endometrium to 4.67 for myometrium. Overall image impairment was rated strongest for T2w MRI (2.95) and least for 2D FLASH MRI (mean 4.24).",

DE (david.schneider@stud.uni-heidelberg.de) Purpose: High vessel attenuation as well as a high contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratio is a prerequisite for highly diagnostic cervical and cerebral CT-angiographic examinations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of calculated low-kV-monoenergetic dual-energy CT (DECT) angiographic datasets. Methods and Materials: 41 patients (21 men, mean age 58 \u00b114) that underwent DECT-angiography of the cervical (n=7) or cerebral vessels (n=34) were retrospectively included in this study. 80 and 140-kV DECT data were used to calculate low-kV monoenergetic image datasets from 120 to 40 keV (10-keV intervals). Vessel and soft tissue attenuation and image noise were measured in various regions of interest and the CNR was subsequently calculated. Differences in image attenuation and CNR were compared between the different monoenergetic datasets. Vessel attenuation and CNR of the best monoenergetic datasets were then compared to conventional 120-kV polyenergetic datasets. Results: In comparison to conventional polyenergetic 120-kV datasets, above all, 60-keV monoenergetic cervical datasets yielded to a significant increase in vessel attenuation and CNR (+40%, +18%; all p < 0.01). For cerebral vessel assessment, in particular 70-keV monoenergetic datasets improved vessel attenuation and CNR (+3%, +10%; all p < 0.01) when compared to conventional 120-kV datasets. Conclusion: Calculated 60-keV monoenergetic image data significantly improves vessel attenuation as well as the CNR of cervical DECT-angiographic studies, whereas 70-kV monoenergetic datasets are favourable to improve vessel attenuation and the CNR of cerebral DECT-angiographic studies. Thus, lowering the amount of iodinated contrast-material might become feasible using monoenergetic-low-kV images, which is particularly important for combined perfusion and angiography protocols. Purpose: Single case reports suggest that black blood MRI (T1-weighted fat and blood suppressed sequences with and without contrast injection; BB-MRI) may visualise intracranial vessel wall contrast enhancement in primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS). In this single-centre observational pilot study we prospectively investigated the value of BB-MRI in the diagnosis of large artery PACNS. Methods and Materials: In this prospective, mono-centric study 12 patients with suspected large artery PACNS received a standardised diagnostic programme including BB-MRI. 10 patients without any evidence of PACNS and without intracranial stenosis served as control group. Vessel wall contrast enhancement was graded (grade 0-2) by two experienced readers blinded to clinical data and correlated to the final diagnosis. Results: Four of 12 included patients received a final diagnosis of PACNS. All of them showed moderate (grade 1) to strong (grade 2) vessel wall contrast enhancement at the sites of stenosis. A moderate (grade 1) vessel wall CE grade was also observed in 6 of the remaining 8 patients in whom alternative diagnoses were made: arteriosclerotic disease (n=4), intracranial dissection (n=1), and Moyamoya disease (n=1). None of the patients in the control group had vessel wall contrast enhancement. Conclusion: Our pilot study demonstrates that vessel wall contrast enhancement is a frequent finding in PACNS and its mimics, but it is absent in patients without evidence of intracranial vascular disease. Larger trials will be necessary to evaluate the utility of BB-MRI in the diagnostic workup of PACNS. Purpose: The availability of endovascular services is increasing, but still not available in the majority of TPA centres. The aim of this study was to describe the relations between NIHSS and large vessel occlusions in patients with hyper-acute ischaemic stroke.",

Methods and Materials: 10 patients with suspected GCA underwent 3.0 Tesla MRI, including fat saturated (fs) T1w scans pre-and post-contrast, optimised for assessment of intradural VWE, and high-resolution fsT1w scans to evaluate superficial extracranial vessels. Temporal artery biopsies were available in 4 cases. VWE of intradural and extracranial vessels was evaluated by two observers Results: In 5 patients, GCA was diagnosed clinically, in 4 biopsy proven. A clear VWE of superficial extracranial vessels was detected in 8 cases. Clear VWE of the intradural internal carotid artery (ICA) was detected in 6 cases, 5 with corresponding vessel wall thickening. Slight enhancement of the right medial cerebral artery was seen in 1 case. In one patient with GCA, no VWE of intradural or extracranial vessels was detected. One patient who did not receive a temporal artery biopsy presented with VWE of intradural and extracranial arteries, but the final clinical diagnosis was connective tissue disease. Conclusion: VWE of extracranial vessels is a frequent finding in GCA. Additionally, VWE of intradural arteries, mainly the ICA, can be found. Therefore, high-resolution MRI seems to be a feasible technique to visualise vasculitic involvement of the extra-and intracranial arteries in GCA. Purpose: To measure cerebrovascular reserve using fMRI (CVR fMRI) in patients with severe stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) to identify those at risk of haemodynamical stroke. Methods and Materials: Among 16 patients with severe intracranial arterial stenosis, 7 patients (4 females; 61.9\u00b118.5years) had a stenosis of the right (n=4) or left (n=3) MCA only. CVR fMRI was performed using BOLD contrast with a block-design hypercapnic challenge (CO2 7%) at 3 T. Averaged end-tidal CO2 pressure (EtCO2) was used as regressor for statistical analyses. We measured %BOLD/mmHg EtCO2 on segmented grey matter of MCA territories. We calculated a laterality index with LIMCA =(Left_CVR-Right_ CVR)/(Left_ CVR+Right_ CVR). LI were compared to those obtained in 100 volunteers that provided a 99% confidence interval for | LIMCA |< 0.08. Basal perfusion was measured using dynamic susceptibility contrast. Results: Basal perfusion measurements were symmetrical in all patients. No adverse reaction to hypercapnia was detected. CVR values ranged from 0.13 to 0.37 with m\u00b1sd=0.25\u00b10.07. Among these 7 patients, three patients had a normal |LIMCA|< 0.08 ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 (0.04\u00b10.01), and four patients had an abnormal |LIMCA|> 0.08 ranging from 0.13 to 0.17 (0.16\u00b10.02). All abnormal LI values identified the MCA territory ipsilateral to the stenosis. Conclusion: These preliminary results show that among patients with severe stenosis of MCA, several patients have abnormal |LIMCA| in the territory ipsilateral to the stenotic artery, suggesting significant CVR impairment that might be at risk of haemodynamic stroke. CVR fMRI should be considered to better define treatment strategy, including intravascular stenting. Purpose: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the endothelial functions in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",

In both patients and controls, levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), systemic endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation) (FMD) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (C-IMT, mm) were measured. Endothelial functions of the brachial and carotid arteries were evaluated by vascular ultrasound. Results: Carotid intima media thickness was significantly higher in patients with NAFLD than controls (0.67\u00b10.09 versus 0.52\u00b10.11 mm, P < 0.001). The average C-IMT measurements were found in groups of control, simple steatosis and NAFLD with (borderline and definitive) NASH as 0.52\u00b10.11, 0.63\u00b10.07 and 0.68\u00b10.1 mm, respectively. The differences between groups were significant (P < 0.001). Measurement of brachial artery FMD was significantly lower in patients with NAFLD compared to controls (7.3\u00b14.8 versus 16.5\u00b17.1%, P < 0.001). FMD measurements in groups of control, the simple steatosis and NAFLD with NASH as 16.5\u00b17.1, 9.64\u00b16.63 and 7.03\u00b14.57%, respectively, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The increase in C-IMT and decrease in FMD were independent of metabolic syndrome and it was also more evident in patients with simple steatosis and NASH compared to controls. Conclusion: Our data suggested that NAFLD is associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased early atherosclerosis compared to healthy subjects. Purpose: This study aimed to assess image quality and radiation dose of CT angiography (CTA) in kidney donors obtained with automated kVp selection and sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE), using scans with fixed kVp and filtered back projection reconstruction algorithm as the comparison. Methods and Materials: Mean attenuation, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at abdominal aorta, right renal artery (RRA) and left renal artery (LRA) were measured in 24 kidney donors who had undergone CTA with tube current modulation, 120 kVp, filtered back projection reconstruction algorithm (Group A) and were compared with 24 BMI-matched kidney donors who had undergone CTA with automated kVp selection and SAFIRE (Group B Purpose: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common cause of cognitive impairment. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunar infarcts are the commonest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters observed in clinical practice. The relationship between these findings on MRI and cognitive impairment remains unclear. The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between lacune count, total lacune volume and location of lacunes with cognition. Methods and Materials: Patients with lacunar stroke and WMHs were recruited to the prospective SCANS study. Baseline data (n=121) was used for this analysis. Multimodal MRI and neuropsychological testing were performed. Lacunes were identified and counted by a neuroradiologist on a T1 image, then mapped using an automated region growing technique. Lacunar volume was calculated from the resulting masks, and lacunar location automatically determined by projection onto standard atlases. T2 WMH volume and brain volume were also measured. Results: In multiple regression controlling for WMH volume and brain volume, both the lacune number and the total volume were related to a significant decrease in executive function (number: Beta=-0.21, p < 0.006; volume: Beta=-0.16, p < 0.04) and processing speed (number: Beta=-0.26, p < 0.001; volume: Beta=-0.24, p < 0.004). Lacunes in the thalamus were associated with impaired processing speed performance (p < 0.002).",

Hepatic flow visualisation was performed using 3D streamlines and time-resolved particle traces. Quantitative evaluation included retrospective extraction of regional maximum and mean velocities, flow volume, vessel area as well as pulsatility and resistance indices. Results: 3D streamlines and particle traces visualisation in the arterial and portal venous system could successfully be performed for almost all patients and volunteers. Quantitative results reveal maximum and mean velocities tend to be lower in MRI compared to Doppler Ultrasound, area showed significant lower values for US (p < 0.01). Comparing the changes after TIPS-stent-graft implantation the data results demonstrated an increase of velocities and flow volume in the venous system as well as hepatic artery. Conclusion: Flow-sensitive 4D MRI enabled a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of arterial and portal venous haemodynamics of liver cirrhosis patients before and after TIPS-stent-graft implantation including a volunteer group. Flow-sensitive 4D MRI may be a standardised method with complete volumetric and functional coverage of the blood flow haemodynamics providing additional information in patients after TIPS-stent-graft implantation.",

Methods and Materials: CE-MRA and SSFP of 60 PV in 17 patients were evaluated. PV diameters were measured in transverse and coronal orientation at predefined levels by two independent readers. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis (BA) were used to assess inter-and intraobserver reliability and variances. F-test was performed for comparison of intra-and interobserver variances. Pearson\u00b4s correlation coefficient and BA were used to compare CE-MRA and SSFP. A t-test was used to determine possible significant differences between the measurements. Results: There was moderate correlation (R = 0.68, transverse; R = 0.66, coronal) without significant difference in diameter measurements between CE-MRA and SSFP (p = 0.15, transverse; p = 0.25, coronal). Intraobserver limits of agreement (LAG) ranged between \u00b10.50 cm (transverse) and \u00b10.86 cm (coronal) for CE-MRA versus \u00b10.40 cm (transverse) and \u00b10.67 cm (coronal) for SSFP.

Only transverse SSFP measurements revealed ICC > 0.75. Intra-and interobserver variances did not reveal significant differences between CE-MRA and SSFP in any orientation (all p-values > 0.05). Conclusion: SSFP and CE-MRA enable comparable precision of PV diameter measurements.

Methods and Materials: 185 smokers (mean heart rate: 71.9 bpm) underwent dual-source CT examinations with acquisition of two sets of images during the same session: (a) an ungated, high-pitch scan over the entire thorax (pitch: 3.0, temporal resolution: 75 ms) (group 1); (b) a prospectively ECG-gated scan over the cardiac cavities (group 2). Two operators independently analysed the CAC load on both examinations and categorised the population according to the Agatston score. Results: The interobserver reproducibility was good for both techniques (group 1: kappa=0.90, group 2: kappa=0.89). The mean absolute values of the Agatston score did not significantly differ between groups (p=0.18). There was good reproducibility between the two techniques in classifying the population according to the commonly used cutoffs (kappa: 0.90). The ungated technique adequately categorised 172 out of the 185 patients (93); in the 13 discordant cases (13/185; 7), the ungated studies yielded lower scores than gated studies, with no more than one score category misplaced by the ungated studies. BMI and heart rates did not significantly differ between concordant and discordant scores (p=0.81, p=0.21, respectively). Differences in CAC scores between techniques were correlated to differences in the CAC scores at the level of the right coronary artery (r=0.98; p=.0001). Conclusion: Despite the mean heart rate of the studied population, a good concordance in assessing the CAC scores was found between ungated, high-pitch and ECG-gated examinations.",

Methods and Materials: Twenty-one patients (8 male, 13 female, mean age 77.2 years) with heart rates < 60 bpm unable to hold their breath underwent two immediately subsequent free-breathing CCTA scans in dual-source CT prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch mode, followed by conventional angiography within 1 month. CCTA data and conventional angiograms were evaluated by segment by two different observers. CCTA image quality was rated on a four-point scale (1 = excellent to 4 = unevaluable) with \u00b350% diameter stenosis considered significant. Purpose: Radiation exposure reduction in cardiac CTA using a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm (AIDR3D) with automatic exposure control (AEC). Methods and Materials: 60 patients were examined on a 320-row detector CT (AquilionONE, Toshiba Medical Systems) using 100 kV, 8-12 cm z-axis, 350 ms acquisition time, 0.5 mm slice thickness and 320 mm FoV. Contrast medium injection was performed using a standardised protocol with 0.66 mg Iodine per kg body weight. Group 1 (G1) consisted of 30 patients (BMI=25.7\u00b13.6 kg/m2, HF=54.9\u00b17.4 bpm) examined using BMI adapted tube current (140-580 mA) and a FBP reconstruction algorithm in combination with advanced noise reduction filters. In group 2 (G2) 30 patients (BMI=25.7\u00b13.7 kg/m2, HF=58.3\u00b17.8 bpm) were examined using the novel reconstruction algorithm AIDR3D. For AEC a target noise of 33 HU was predetermined. Analysis was performed using circular regions of interests placed into the descending aorta (DA), left ventricular lumen (LV) and myocardial wall (MW). Signal-and contrast-to-noise-ratio (SNR, CNR) were calculated. Doselength-products (DLP) were recorded and effective doses were estimated. Results in G1 and G2 were compared using an unpaired t-test. Results: Both SNR and CNR differed significantly in both groups: SNR in G1 and G2 were 19.5\u00b16.6 and 23.0\u00b15.3, respectively, in DA (p=0.025) and 12.7\u00b14.4 and 20.4\u00b14.5, respectively, in LV (p < 0.001). CNR in G1 and G2 were 9.3\u00b13.7 and 19.3\u00b15.0, respectively (p < 0.001). Effective dose was in G2 (0.88\u00b10.34mSv) 24% less than in G1 (1.15\u00b10.46mSv; p < 0.011). Conclusion: AIDR3D with AEC allows for significant radiation dose reduction compared with advanced FBP reconstruction with BMI-adapted exposure. Image quality parameters in the AIDR3D group were superior to the reference group indicating further dose reduction potential. Purpose: The verbal interaction between the child and the radiographer in the radiographic examination is an unexplored, but important area of clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the nature of that interaction between child and radiographer and the extent to which it varied as a function of the child's age.",

The distribution of task-focused and socio-emotional utterances varied with regard to children's age.

What could be done to improve this? Methods and Materials: A method called patient-focused redesign (developed by Leicester Royal Infirmary, adapted to Norwegian conditions by Ringerike Hospital HF) was used as a tool to find a better workflow in ordering x-rays. A multidisciplinary team was assembled, and a project outline was made with a process demarcation. The team prepared a communication plan, mapped the current workflow, had a creative phase redesigning a new workflow, and measured the situation before the new workflow was tested in the hospital. An analysis of the old and new workflow was made. Evaluation was done after the new workflow had been in place for 1.5 years; new measurements were done to see the effects of the changes in the workflow. Results: Numbers of steps in the workflow were halved, saving time for several professions. X-ray examinations not ordered on time were reduced by 76.5%. Examinations ordered a week or more before the images were taken, which is within the desired timeframe, were increased by 64.1%. Conclusion: Patient-focused redesign is a good method for finding better and more efficient workflows; it can save time, increase the exploitation ratio of the equipment, and ultimately increase the quality of the radiographic service.",

Results: Improving actions have been taken together with a method of monitoring the most critical issues with greater severity or frequency of occurrence in the CT process. Critical areas: high number of booking errors from the radiological studies of central booking, inappropriate requests by general practitioners (GPs). Improvement action (IA): organization of the audit with GPs, the final shared document has been spread through the Internet site. High number of patients not adequately prepared for the examination (non-hydrated, non-fasting, incomplete clinical information, and incomplete filling of the informed consent form examination). IA: a letter from the chief of radiology was sent to all departments to alert that requests for CT must be sent in. Radiology correctly completed and audit with GPs. Errors found in PACS. IA: correction of PACS errors and permanent organization of audit. Conclusion: This project helped the development of effective interventions closely related to the understanding of the organization's critical work in the CT process with the need to streamline the planning CT scan of the list to avoid an incongruous workload and to give each patient the right welcome.

An increasing number of well qualified radiographers are needed and healthcare authorities are worried about the growing shortage of radiographers. Job (in)satisfaction has been highlighted as a contributing factor to turnover, respectively, to long-time retention. The aim of this survey was to appreciate workplace conditions and job satisfaction among radiographers. Methods and Materials: All radiographers working in Switzerland were invited to participate with an online questionnaire. Different factors contributing to job satisfaction were scored from -2 (very unsatisfied) up to +2 (very satisfied). Results: 753 radiographers completed the questionnaire. The response rate is estimated at 26%. 62% are working in diagnostic, 23 % in nuclear medicine and 15% in radiooncology. 37% are working for more than 10 years in the same place. The overall job satisfaction level was scored at 0.66. The highest levels were reached for the diversity of job activities (+1.19), the quality of radiology facilities (+ 1.16), teamworking (+1.03) and autonomy (+1.03). The lowest levels were reached for collaboration with radiologists (+0.23), salary (+ 0.17) and career opportunities (0). Conclusion: Radiographers in Switzerland are rather satisfied about their job and the workplace conditions. In order to avoid shortage, efforts should be taken to increase the number of radiographer students and in supporting returnees. Jobenrichment measures are seen as a necessity for retention in a profession with low career opportunities.",

All cases of endometriosis of the posterior compartments (18/25 patients) presented an abnormal pathway (3 rd class), while remaining cases with anterior-medial localisation were equally distributed in 1 st and 2 nd class. We obtained low FA values in both groups; however, in case-control group range values were included between 0.47 and 0.34 while in patient groups FA values were lower between 0.36 and 0.24. Conclusion: Fibre tracking allowed a complete evaluation of the female pelvis defining the global situation of the patient and leastly formulating a potential explanation to symptoms. Fibrotic reaction, adhesions and nerves growth stimulation factors may explain both of the altered branch morphology and the lower FA values. We suggest tractography as a complementary tool for the female pelvis study, representing the only non-invasive way to study nervous pathways. Purpose: To verify whether MRI accuracy in diagnosing deep infiltrating colorectal endometriosis (DICE) can be improved using an association of two selected findings. Laparoscopy or histopathology was taken as the gold standard. Methods and Materials: Imaging database of our Institute was retrospectively reviewed. T2-weighted MR images were evaluated by two experienced radiologists using two criteria. First, not thickened or thickened intestinal wall surrounded by fat-plane interface represents a normal result; nodules/hypointense plaque-like lesions in the adjacent fat-plane joint to thickened intestinal wall are considered an abnormal result. Second, not thickened or thickened intestinal wall surrounded or not by fat-plane interface represents a normal result; nodules/hypointense plaque-like lesions in the adjacent fat-plane joint to thickened intestinal wall showing \"radiating retracting shape\" are considered an abnormal result. A third radiologist looked in medical history for laparoscopy and histopathology. MRI results were compared with laparoscopy or histopathology findings by 2 x 2 tables and were statistically analysed (K statistics). .30 years) with clear symptoms attributable to pelvic floor dysfunction. All patients were given a questionnaire designed to obtain physiological data (age, gender, BMI) and pathological (diabetes, comorbidities, previous pelvic surgery). The MRI provided a morphological study with T2-weighted sequences in the axial sagittal and coronal plane and an Cinematic FIESTA (Fast Imaging Employing Steady-State Acquisition) in the sagittal plane at rest and during the phase of maximum straining, to measure the line pubo-coccygeal (PCL), the line H (pelvis diastasis) and the M (lower pelvis). Results: BMI correlated significantly with H (p = 0.037) and PCL (p = 0.026), while age correlated with H (p = 0.009) and M (p = 0.004).

T2 SI and T1 SI of fibroids were measured on pre-treatment examination before and after administration of gadolinium (Gd-BOPTA, Bracco); also the distance between centre of myoma and skin, skin thickness, maximum diameter and volume of fibroids were recorded. The day of treatment the non-perfused volume (NPV) was recorded at the end of the treatment. It was considered treatment time in terms of energy (J) used and duration of single sonication. All parameters were related to final NPV and volume shrinkage at 12 months to established short-and long-term results of treatment. Results: Difference between T1 SI of the fibroids and healthy myometrium significantly correlates with volume shrinkage (45%) and NPV (60%, r=0.85). T2 SI on pre-treatment studies, distance between skin surface and centre of myoma (53\u00b119 mm) and skin thickness (13\u00b17 mm) show a mild correlation with volume reduction at 12 months (36+18 mm, respectively r=-72.5 p=0.047 and r=69.7 p=0.03).Moreover, there was positive correlation between measured parameters, sonication duration and energy necessary to obtain a > 50% NPV (70\u00b115%, r= 62.8, p=0.021).

We theoretically divided female pelvis in three compartments and concentrated on the posterior one, evaluating, in particular, the uterosacral ligaments and the specific signs of posterior cul-de-sac obliteration. Results: MRI diagnosed posterior cul-de-sac obliteration in 15/19 patients. We detected in 5/15 cases nodular endometriosis implants in PCS; signs of fibrotic plaque on the uterine serosal surface were identified in 4/15 cases; 3/15 cases showed a tethered appearance of the rectum, 6/15 cases presented an elevation of the posterior vaginal fornix.

Every patient presented mild or moderate cognitive impairment according to Reisberg score (3-4 grade). Standard brain MR and spectroscopy brain MR were performed using a 3 T intensity MRI device (Archieva TX, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands). Spectroscopy MR was focused in posterior parietal and frontal lobes gray substance using a unique volume (20 x 20 x 15 mm) and two different echotimes, TE (32 and 136). Morphology and volume of temporal lobes were evaluated through FLAIR coronal images which were used to quantify temporal horn width and so classify patients in four groups. JMRUI (Java Magnetic Resonance User Interface) was used to calculate quantitative parameters in MR spectroscopy. MR was used to measure: calculation of NAA (N-acetyl aspartate), Cr (creatinine), Cho (choline) and mI (myo-inositol) metabolites ratios. We used analysis of variance to compare metabolite ratios between the different patient groups previously defined. Results: We found significant differences (p \u00b2 0.05) between groups in NAA/Cho concentration (p=0.022), both in long and in short eco times and frontal and parietal anatomical regions. No other significant differences between groups were found. Conclusion: MR spectroscopy could increase efficiency in Alzheimer's disease premature diagnosis as well as turning out to be a useful additional tool for the clinician next to clinical history.",

Results: Total calculated levodopa equivalent dose was higher in EDS-PD when compared to PD patients (p < 0.05). Comparison of EDS-PD with PD patients and controls showed increased GM volume bilaterally in the hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the fusiform gyrus and in cortical areas in the temporal, frontal and parietal lobes (p < 0.001). Conclusion: EDS-PD patients present increased regional GM volume in the mesolimbic/mesocortical dopamine pathway, which is activated during sleep. Drug-induced GM volume increase through a process of neuronal plasticity may represent the underlying mechanism.

We performed T1 weighted MPRAGE, T2 and PD weighted TSE and EPI (on 12 non-collinear directions at b0 and 1000s/mm2 to assess DTI) sequences. FA was computed with standard formulas.

Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a 3D semi-automated evaluation software for its accuracy and time saving potential for CT perfusion myocardial blood flow (MBF) and blood volume (MBV) assessments compared to manual evaluation as well as to SPECT. Methods and Materials: 37 dynamic, time-resolved myocardial perfusion CT datasets acquired using a dual-source CT system (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany) were assessed both manually and by use of the semi-automated prototype for MBF and MBV, based on the AHA 16-segment model. Time required for each assessment was recorded. Results were compared to SPECT as the standard of reference. Results: 592 segments were evaluated. 19 (3.21%) were excluded due to insufficient coverage. A comparison of MBF and MBV measurements using the prototype versus manual assessment showed high correlation (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.85/0.83, p < 0.0001).

Results: At baseline mean ABS was 19.5\u00b120.1 and mean FRI was 12\u00b110.7; 64.5\u00b111.3m after WB-CTA all patients received an interview to determine health status. According to Kaplan-Meier curves, mean event-free time was of 62.3\u00b12.4m for ABS< 10, 57.6\u00b11.9m for 10<ABS20, with a statistically significant difference between the three groups (p=0.012). Mean event-free time was 57\u00b15.6m for FRI mild-risk group and 52.5\u00b14.2m for high-risk group without significant differences between the two groups (p=0.072). For the prediction of CV events, in the highrisk group ABS showed an accuracy of 0.89, meanwhile FRI of 0.69 (p=0.007). Multivariable analysis showed that only age (p=0.011), ABS score (p=0.000) and therapy (p=0.001) were independent predictors of hard CV events. Conclusion: WBCTA-derived ABS reflects real atherosclerotic burden and provides superior risk stratification and event prediction with respect to FRI; hard event prediction was significantly associated with age, ABS and therapy. Purpose: Detection of patients with \"high-risk-CAD\" consisting of left main (LM) and/or three-vessel CAD (3VD) is important because optimal medical treatment combined with revascularisation has shown to improve prognosis in these patients. Diagnostic performance of CT coronary angiography (CTCA) to detect or exclude \"high-risk-CAD\" is assessed. The discrimination of \"high-risk-CAD\" by CTCA is compared with Duke risk score and calcium score. Methods and Materials: We evaluated retrospectively 1136 symptomatic patients with stable angina without prior revascularisation (61\u00b111 years, 31% women) who underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and CTCA between 2004 and 2011. Vessels were considered obstructive in the presence of \u00b350% lumen diameter stenosis. Results: \"High-risk-CAD\" determined by ICA was present in 17% (196/1136). Sensitivity of CTCA to detect \"high-risk-CAD\" was 95% (95% CI: 91%-97%), specificity was 83% (81%-86%), positive predictive value was 54% (49%-59%) and negative predictive value was 99% (98%-99%). The \"high-risk-CAD\" discrimination by CTCA was significantly (AUC: 0.90) higher compared with Duke risk score (AUC: 0.69, p < 0.0001) and calcium score (AUC: 0.73, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: CTCA accurately rules out \"high-risk-CAD\" in patients with stable angina. CTCA provides incremental value in the discrimination of \"high-risk-CAD\" compared with the Duke risk score and calcium score. Results: 85% of the total radiation dose was applied during the pre-and postinterventional CT-series leaving only 15% to being applied by the CT-guided intervention itself. Single slice acquisition was associated with lower doses compared to continuous CT-fluoroscopy (37 mGy*cm vs. 153 mGy*cm, p < 0.001). Overall, the use of 80 kV during the interventions led to significantly lower radiation doses compared with 120 kV (mean: 86 mGy*cm vs. 215 mGy*cm, p < 0.001). Third quartile of radiation doses varied considerably for different interventions depending on complexity. Conclusion: To our knowledge, these data represent the largest sample of CTguided interventional procedures. Therefore, we suggest preliminary reference levels for each subgroup based on the third quartiles of our analysis. The radiation dose applied can be reduced using 80 kV instead of 120 kV for the intervention and by preferring single-slice acquisition over CT-fluoroscopy whenever possible. (57 tumours) presenting local recurrences of STS of the trunk or limbs were selected from our institutional database. Two radiologists visually assessed possibility of cryotherapy according to common inclusion criteria: maximal diameter size of the tumour \u00b210 cm, distance to skin > 5 mm, distance to neurovascular structures at least 3 mm, potential access, absence of articular involvement and planned cryoablation covering the entire lesion volume. Characteristics of patients eligible for cryoablation were comparing with not selected patients. Results: Mean tumour size was 64 mm (10-178). Most frequent histological subtypes were unclassified sarcomas (n=16), liposarcomas (n=15), or myxofibrosarcomas (n=7). Surgical treatment consisted in wide excision (n=16), or combined treatment (n=24). After surgery, the severe complications rate was 47.5%. Since relapse, mean follow-up was 42.8 months with a median overall survival of 57.6 months and median recurrence-free survival of 39.5 months. A subgroup of 13 patients was identified and comparison with other patients showed that trunk, shoulder and pelvic girdle locations (p =0.002), locally aggressive (P=0.016) and deep (P=0.002) tumours, \u00b25 cm (P=0.044), and liposarcoma and myxofibrosarcoma subtypes (P=0.007) were indicative of eligibility for cryoablation. Conclusion: Eligibility criteria as defined are useful for plan cryoablation as a technically feasible alternative to surgery for treatment of local relapse of STS.",

Methods and Materials: 6 patients with 8 lesions were treated using the Robio Ex (Perfint Healthcare, MA, USA) robotic positioning system. All the lesions were smaller than 2.5 cm diameter. All the procedures were performed under general anaesthesia. Following baseline CT scans, the lesions were identified. The puncture site and trajectory were then determined on Robio Ex workstation. The angulation of the needle, depth of lesion, the fluoroscopic dose as well as the accuracy of placements was determined. The performance level of procedures was documented for each biopsy on a five-point scale (5-1: Excellent-Poor). Results: All the tumours were targeted successfully. One lesion in 2 patients required minor readjustment. 4 patients (5 lesions) had needle placement with no cranio-caudal angulation, whereas 2 patients (3 lesions) had cranio-caudal angulation of up to 200. The orbital angulation ranged from 60 to 1180. The depth of needle ranged from 12.2 to 4.7 cm from skin surface. Performance levels were all 5 except in one patient (4). The fluoroscopic (DLP) and total dose (CTDIvol) for the entire procedure were 316\u00b192 mGy.cm and 260.83\u00b170.02 mGy, respectively. Post-RFA CT scans showed successful ablation of the targeted lesions. No immediate complications were noted. Conclusion: Robotic-assisted planning and needle placement appear to be technically easier, it requires fewer number of needle passes, fewer check scans",

Possibly, differences in CAD risk between races are influenced by racial differences in thoracic adipose tissue. We compared CT-derived measures of thoracic fat and potential correlations with CAD between African American and white patients. Methods and Materials: 372 age-and-gender-matched black and white patients (186 black: mean age 54\u00b111 yrs, 50% men; 186 white: mean age 54\u00b111 yrs, 50% men) who underwent thoracic dual-source CT for chest pain evaluation were retrospectively included. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume and mediastinal adipose tissue (MAT) volume were quantified using an automated analysis algorithm. Peri-coronary fat thickness (PFT) was measured on reconstructed sections orthogonal to the right coronary artery centreline. Non-calcified and calcified plaque volume was quantified by applying a threshold-based automated algorithm. CAD was defined as 50% or greater coronary artery stenosis. Patients with CAD showed significantly higher EAT than those without CAD (97.9\u00b152.6 cm 3 vs. 77.4\u00b143.5 cm 3 , p < 0.05). Significant correlations were observed between EAT measurements and calcium volume (r=0.221; p < 0.05). The relationship between race and extent of adipose tissue remained significant after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusion: Measures of thoracic fat were generally higher for symptomatic white than for black patients suggesting a differential relationship between thoracic adipose tissue and CAD pathophysiology by race. Purpose: The Imactis Navigation System with electromagnetic needle holder tracking was developed to allow interactive display of the needle trajectory in a 3D volumetric CT volume, allowing the radiologist to choose optimal entry point and track to the target during CT-guided percutaneous interventions. The CTNAV trial compares the accuracy of the needle placement using standard CT procedure (CT group) and using the navigation system procedure (NAV group). Methods and Materials: Prospective, randomised, comparative, open, controlled study conducted between June 2010 and January 2012 in Grenoble University Hospital on 120 patients who had to undergo a percutaneous CT procedure. Patients were randomised to have normal procedure (CT group) or Navigation System assisted procedure (NAV group). The main outcome was the distance between the planned trajectory and the effective needle trajectory after the first placement attempt. Significance was set at 0. ",

Methods and Materials: Rats bearing breast cancer bone metastases were imaged using VCT and DCE-MRI prior to and 25 days after the onset of therapy; untreated (n=12) and treated (integrin inhibitor monotherapy; n=12) or together with antiresorptive agent (combination therapy; n=11) to assess osteolysis and functional MRI parameters, respectively. Mean vessel diameter and SMA and collagen-IV-positive vessel area fraction were assessed histologically. Results: Compared to the control group, bone defect healing at the osteolytic site occurred in rats receiving monotherapy and even more frequent after combination therapy as shown by VCT. In addition, we observed a profound effect of mono-and combination therapy on the tumour vasculature determined by DCE-MRI parameters amplitude and exchange rate constant. Both therapy regimens induced elevated vessel permeability/perfusion in bone metastases, but opposite to monotherapy, combination of agents additionally elevated the blood volume. Immunofluorescence analysis of osteolytic lesions revealed more tumour blood vessels after combination therapy and equally immature vasculature as compared to monotherapy. Conclusion: Upon treatment with integrin inhibitor monotherapy or in combination with an antiresorptive agent, vessel remodelling could be assessed by DCE-MRI. Interestingly, the degree of vessel remodelling could be correlated with bone defect healing, so we conclude the existence of a strong interaction between tumour angiogenesis and bone turnover in lytic osseous lesions. Purpose: Islet transplantation is a less invasive/safer/repeatable option than surgical pancreas transplantation for type 1 diabetic patients; it can be performed after kidney transplantation (IAK), alone (ITA) in patients without chronic renal insufficiency, or as an autotransplantation (IAT) after pancreatectomy (immunosuppression unnecessary).

Sijens; Groningen/NL (h.dijkstra01@umcg.nl) Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic implications of fatty liver on DWI by assessing the hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and T2* of healthy subjects in eight liver segments in order to eliminate patient-related confounding factors such as cirrhosis and fibrosis. Methods and Materials: Eleven healthy volunteers were examined with DWI (seven b-values) and two series of in-and out-of-phase dual-echo spoiled gradient echo sequences (SPGR) to obtain the HFF (Dixon's method). A third SPGR series was acquired to calculate T2 * relaxation. DWI data were analyzed using the IVIM model: molecular diffusion (Dslow), microperfusion (Dfast) and the respective fractions (fslow/fast). For each subject, four circular regions-of-interest (\u00f822.3 mm) were drawn in each segment according to the Couinaud-Bismuth classification. Data with low SNR< 5 were excluded. IVIM parameters were compared between groups of low (\u00b22.5%), intermediate (2.5\u00b2HHF< 10%) and high HHF (> 10%). Linear correlations between HHF, DWI parameters, and T2 * were assessed. Results: In each segment, Dslow decreased with increasing HFF. Dslow averaged over all segments differed significantly (p < 0.001) between low (0.99\u00d710 -3 mm 2 /s), intermediate (0.74\u00d710 -3 mm 2 /s) and high HFF (0.32\u00d710 -3 mm 2 /s). Both Dslow and T2* decreased with HFF (R 2 =0.89; R 2 =0.72). Dfast and fslow/fast showed small intergroup differences (p < 0.04). Conclusion: Increasing hepatic fat fractions caused significant reduction of the molecular diffusion and shortening of T2*. This implies that hepatic DWI hindered by fat leads to apparent fluctuations of the molecular diffusion and hypointensity on DWI images; this may induce false diagnoses such as fibrosis or cirrhosis.",

K-trans was assessed by DCE-MRI datasets. Three patients received Ferucarbotran labelled islets and were monitored with T2*sequences (before islets-tx, 7 days and each month after). Unlabelled islets were infused in the remaining three patients. Glycated haemoglobin, blood glucose, daily insulin request and stimulated C-peptide were monthly assessed in order to calculate beta-score (0-8) Purpose: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass and activity is considered a significant factor for the development of adiposity and metabolic syndrome in humans, and represents a natural target for the modulation of energy expenditure. We evaluated the correlation of BAT activity and active volume as detectable on FDG-PET/CT scans with abdominal body fat composition and liver fat estimation. Methods and Materials: 4852 FDG-PET/CT examinations in 3680 individual patients were screened for BAT, resulting in 601 patients and controls for subsequent analysis, matched for exam date and therefore ambient temperature, age, and gender. In addition to BAT volume and activity, an automated segmentation was used to determine visceral fat and subcutaneous fat as well as lean tissue in the abdomen. Liver fat was estimated in 430 patients with non-contrast-enhanced CT. Spearman rank correlation between parameters and a multi-variate model for liver fat excluding influencing parameters was calculated. Results: BAT volume and activity showed a significant inverse correlation with total adipose tissue (activity p < 0.001/volume p=0.022) and visceral adipose tissue In 15 studies, which were mainly underpowered and of heterogeneous study design, 31 different parameters were studied. Most frequently studied parameters were tumour diameter or volume, Ktrans, Kep, Ve, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Other parameters were analysed in only two or less studies. Tumour diameter, volume, and kinetic parameters did not show any pretreatment differences between responders and non-responders. In two studies, pretreatment differences in ADC were observed between study groups. At early response monitoring significant and non-significant changes for all parameters were observed for most of the imaging parameters. Conclusion: Evidence on distinguishing responders and non-responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using pretreatment MRI, as well as using MRI for early response monitoring, is weak and based on underpowered study results and heterogeneous study design. Thus, the value of breast MRI for response evaluation has not yet been established.",

The lesions were measured in axial plane according to RECIST and mRECIST. The volumes of the entire lesion and of the viable tissue were computed. Results: The longest diameters measured according to RECIST and mRECIST and the appropriate volumes were significantly different initially, after the 2 nd cycle and upon the completion of NACT (p < 0.001 for all). The size of the lesions was significantly different with/without the necrotic areas. Differences in tumour diameter and volume change (delta; %) between RECIST and mRECIST were not significant after the 2 nd cycle and upon completion of NACT (p> 0.01 for both). According to either RECIST or mRECIST, including the volume measurements, the same number of patients were classified in the same response category, i.e., early response -PR (21.4%); late response -PR (50.0%). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first trial testing the use of mRECIST in extrahepatic setting. There was no significant difference in changes of diameters or the corresponding volumes according to RECIST Vs. mRECIST. Further research in larger groups needs to assess the use of the tools in the follow-up of new NACT protocols.

Purpose: There is no consensus on surveillance strategies of reconstructed breasts after breast cancer, and it is routinely based on clinical examination alone. This study aims to assess the incidence and radiological presentation of breast cancer recurrences after deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap reconstruction for women with a history of breast cancer. Methods and Materials: 265 consecutive women who underwent DIEP flap reconstruction after breast cancer from 1997 to 2009 were included in this retrospective study. All had annual screening for recurrence and we reviewed their follow-up records in our institution. The date and site of recurrences -ipsilateral or controlateral to the reconstructed breast, regional and metastatic disease -were retrieved. Clinical and radiological presentations -on mammography, ultrasound, and MRI -were further analysed. Results: 31 of 265 patients presented 34 relapses, with a mean delay of 4.7 years (SD=2.9) after DIEP reconstruction; 14 (41%) were ipsilateral, while 6 (18%) were controlateral and 14 (41%) metastatic. Ipsilateral recurrences had a tendency to occur earlier (3.8 years, SD=2.4, p=0.11) and 12 presented at a clinically patent stage.

Bone destruction was noted only in 3 cases (12%). Conclusion: Nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphomas of the sinonasal regions often presents with diffuse mucosal thickening rather than mass lesion. And they can mimic inflammatory disease such as sinusitis. Radiologists should be familiar with these findings indicative of the possibility of NKTL, and should perform a histopathologic confirmation to establish a diagnosis. Results: A significant relationship between symptoms and morphological manifestations was found (disk displacement (p < 0.001), osteoarthritis (p < 0.001) and effusion (p = 0.001)). In the group without reduction there were significant increases in the risk of experiencing symptoms (p = 0.002) in the group with reduction the risk was marginal (p = 0.071). Significant correlation between age and osteoarthritis (p = 0.001) and age and effusion (p = 0.022) was found. There was no correlation between sex and morphological manifestations. Significant increases in the risk of experiencing symptoms were found in the group with morphological manifestations (disk displacement (p = 0.006), osteoarthritis (p < 0.001) and effusion (p < 0.001)). Statistically marginal results were verified with multivariate analysis. Conclusion: MRI morphological manifestations of the TMJ correlate with the presence of symptoms, therefore MRI has a crucial role in the diagnosis of treatment of TMJ dysfunction.

Image quality at three defined heights (lymph node levels=LNL 2, 3, 7) were independently rated by 2 radiologists blinded to the reconstruction algorithm. Readers rated image quality including artefacts, contrast and noise using a semi-quantitative scale of 0 to 10 (lower than 5 was defined as non-diagnostic) yielding a summary score for each height.

Methods and Materials: Ten volunteers underwent a TMJ MR study with surface coils including a proton density (PD) fat-saturated 3D sequence \"SPACE\" and 2D PD fat-saturated sequences acquired on parasagittal and paracoronal planes. Twenty TMJ were imaged and analysed. The contrast between articular disk (AD) and bilaminar zone signals was measured on parasagittal images and normalised by the AD signal. Capability of 3D sequences to depict eight small anatomical structures of the TMJ (4 on parasagittal and 4 on paracoronal plane) was assessed and compared to that of standard 2D sequences. Results: Contrast between bilaminar zone and AD in 3D and 2D sequences was 2.93 and 2.61, respectively (p 0.34). Fifty-eight out of 80 structures assessed in parasagittal plane were detectable on 2D sequences, 67/80 on 3D sequences (p 0.03). Among the 80 structures assessed on paracoronal images, 40 were recognised on 2D sequences, 67 on 3D sequences (p 0.0001). Conclusion: High resolution 3D MR imaging of TMJ is feasible with 3D PD fatsaturated SPACE sequences. The detectability of anatomical structures, potentially key for joint functionality (ligaments) is enhanced in comparison to standard 2D sequences, especially on paracoronal plane.

We analysed 8 matching anatomical ROIs in the medial and lateral knee compartment in both examinations, using the T1 relaxation times as a measure of cartilage quality.

With the resulting FPCT kernel best matching the standard MDCT kernel (U90u), joint phantoms with differently sized cartilage defects were scanned. CT numbers and noise in iodine contrast and phantom cartilage tissue were measured, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were calculated. Depiction quality of cartilage defects was qualitatively rated by two independent radiologists. Results: A sharp reconstruction kernel for all FPCT protocols best matched the resolution of the standard MDCT kernel. High-resolution 20s 1x1 binning FPCT showed superior resolution in higher frequencies than 1.6 lp/mm. The CNR were highest in 20s FPCT, followed by 5s FPCT binned and MDCT protocols. Interreader agreement for depiction quality of cartilage defects was substantial and high in joint phantoms (0.74 and 0.8, respectively; p < 0.001). The best ratings of cartilage defect depiction quality were seen in FPCT 20s, followed by FPCT 5s and MDCT acquisitions. Conclusion: FPCT arthrography offers superior CNR and cartilage defect depiction quality to MDCT, and spatial resolution for small structures is higher when applying high-resolution acquisition protocols. subjects with risk factors for OA (incidence cohort) and 40 subjects from the control cohort. Right knee 3 T MRIs were analysed at baseline and 48 months. Coronal FLASH sequence was used to measure cartilage volume at baseline, multi-echo spinecho sequence to generate T2 maps at baseline and 48 months. Regression models were adjusted for age, gender and BMI and were applied to 4 compartments (medial femur, lateral femur, medial tibia and lateral tibia). Results: Global T2 measurements increased in all cohorts over 48 months. Baseline T2 were significantly greater in the progression cohort compared to incidence and control cohort (P < 0.001), whereas 48-month follow-up data showed significantly greater measurements in the Incidence cohort (P < 0.003). Most pronounced T2 changes over time were observed in the incidence cohort (P < 0.023), changes in the progression cohort were not significant. Mean volume did not significantly differ between the cohorts, but progression cohort subjects showed the highest volumes in all compartments. Purpose: The goal of the study was to demonstrate the benefits of T2 mapping to the assessment of lumbar disc repair after the ADCT. Methods and Materials: 50 patients, male and female, age range 18-40, with a single-level degenerative disc disease (DDD) were studied. All patients had a standard lumbar microdiscetomy performed and 4-6 weeks after the surgery underwent the ADCT. Prior to the surgery, one month later and 3, 6 and 12 months after the ADCT each patient had a MR examination on the 1.5 T MR scanner. 20 patients completed a 12-month long follow-up protocol. T2 mapping revealed the level of DDD and the adjacent levels. The evaluation of signal intensity was carried out using pixel value software. Results: Each patient during the 12-month long follow-up reported a significant relief of pain: VAS score ranged 0-3, ODI score 0-20%. In the MR examination held after the ADCT, changes in signal intensity seen on T2-weighted MR images were reported. T2 mapping showed signs of the disc repair regardless of the lack of changes in disc dimensions. Mild increase of T2 with improved homogeneity of the structural morphology of the nucleus pulposus was observed on T2 after the ADCT. Conclusion: T2 mapping may be used for evaluating the changes of the molecular composition and structural integrity of the intervertebral disc after the ADCT and other novel restorative therapies. It has also the potential to be valuable in the detection of the early degeneration in the intervertebral disc. Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of T2* and T1Gd mapping to assess glenohumeral cartilage, and to establish baseline values of healthy glenohumeral cartilage at 3 T. Methods and Materials: Forty asymptomatic volunteers (mean age: 24.8 \u00b1 2.2 years) without shoulder abnormality were included. The MRI protocol comprised a three-dimensional (3D) double-echo steady-state (DESS) sequence for morphological cartilage evaluation, a 3D gradient-echo (GRE) multiecho sequence for T2* assessment, and a dual-flip-angle 3D GRE sequence for T1Gd mapping. Statistical assessment involved descriptive statistics establishing mean T2* and T1Gd values \u00b1 standard deviation and the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to identify any significant differences between the T2* and T1Gd values of various regions of the glenohumeral joint. Intra-class correlation (ICC) analysis comparing repetitive T2* and T1Gd measures of ten randomly selected individuals was used to assess intra-and inter-observer reliability.

The procedure is carried out in a totally non-invasive manner and features a high-safety profile. Results: MRI-guided focused ultrasound treatment was technically successful in 115 of 123 patients (93.5%). In 8 patients treatment was not possible due to bowel loops in the beam pathway that could not be mitigated (n=6), patient movement (n=1) and system malfunction (n=1). Average non-perfused volume ratio was 88\u00b115% (range, 38 to 100). Mean applied energy level was 5400\u00b11200J, and mean number of sonications was 74\u00b127. No major complications occurred. Two cases of first degree skin burn resolved within one week after the intervention. Of the baseline characteristics analysed, only the planned treatment volume had a statistically significant impact on the non-perfused volume ratio. Purpose: Placenta percreta (PP) is a recognised cause of severe postpartum haemorrhage, with high risk of blood transfusions and emergency hysterectomy with maternal morbility and mortality. Our purpose is to evaluate the role of bilateral occlusion balloon catheter insertion in to both internal iliac arteries (IIA) before elective caesarean to prevent haemorrhage and to preserve the uterus. This is one of the longest cohort of women treated with prophylactic balloon occlusion and prevents caesarean hysterectomy in abnormal placentation. Methods and Materials: Twenty-two pregnant women who were identified as having a PP by US were treated prophylactically with bilateral occlusion balloon catheters placed in the anterior trunk of both IIA prior to elective caesarean. The balloons were inflated immediately after the baby delivery and deflated four hours later. Patients with peri-operative bleeding were treated with uterine artery embolisation (UAE), blood transfusion or hysterectomy. For each patient, estimated volume of blood lost and transfusion required was recorded. Results: Abnormal placentation was confirmed histologically as percreta (13), acreta (7) and increta (2). Estimated median blood lost during the delivery was noted 1.8L (range 0.5-12L). Postpartum haemorrhage occurred in nine patients, six had successful embolisation and three required hysterectomy. No foetal or mother death occurred. Conclusion: Prophylactic occlusion balloon catheter insertion in both IIA prior to elective caesarean deliveries in patients with abnormal placenta contributes to successful treatment, reduced blood lost and preserved the uterus in this high risk group of women. Results: A total of 11 transcatheter embolisation procedures of bilateral uterine arteries with or without extra-uterine feeding arteries were performed as the firstline treatment, and with a technical success rate of 82% (9/11). Embolisation was incomplete in two patients who had an extra-uterine blood supply or a dominant draining vein; the former recovered from menorrhagia during our close observation, while the latter underwent a successful second embolisation procedure. Clinical success was achieved in the remaining eight patients after a single procedure and there was no recurrence of bleeding. Only one minor complication occurred: rupture of the proximal UA. Recovery to their normal menstrual cycle was seen in all eight of the clinically successful patients, one of whom subsequently had an uneventful intrauterine pregnancy carried to term. .9 years \u00b1 9.9 years) underwent a pre-therapeutic FDG-PET/CT scan and a FDG-PET/CT after the second cycle of NACT. Histopathology served as the reference standard. SUVmax of cancer lesions before and after the second cycle of NACT were measured. Two evaluation algorithms were used: (a) pCR: Sinn Score 3 and 4, npCR: Sinn Score 0-2; (b) pCR: Sinn Score 4, npCR: Sinn Score 0-3. The absolute and relative decline of the SUVmax (\u0394SUVmax, \u0394SUVmax (%))was calculated. Differences of the SUVmax and of the SUVmax decline between pCR and npCR lesions were tested for statistical significance (p <.05). To identify the optimal cut-off value of \u0394SUVmax (%) to differentiate between pCR lesions and npCR lesions a receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed. Results: Using evaluation algorithm A the \u0394SUVmax was 13.5 (pCR group) and 3.9 (npCR group) (P = 0.006); the \u0394SUVmax (%) was 79% and 47%, respectively (P = 0.001).

In all cases we performed a whole body CHO-PET and compared findings with referring CT (n=20) and/or MRI scanning (n=11), for a total of 25 paired scans. The reference standard for validating imaging results was either histology (5 patients), or a multidisciplinary work-up. For every modality we determined diagnostic accuracy on a scan-based and on a site-based analysis. Results: On a scan-based analysis CHO-PET and CT/MRI demonstrated an accuracy of 86.4% and 88%, respectively, whereas on a site-based analysis the two modalities demonstrated a sensitivity and accuracy, respectively, of 67.6% and 65.9% for PET, and 71.7% and 69% for CT/MRI. In both analyses, no statistically significant difference was found on T-test. In 7/23 patients, HCC showed either loco-regional involvement (n=3) or distant metastases (n=6). All extra-hepatic lesions were properly detected by CHO-PET (accuracy 100%), whereas CT/MRI missed a large part of them (accuracy 58.8%) and this most likely due to the limited field of view during acquisition. In 7 cases (30.4%), PET information determined a change in treatment planning. Conclusion: According to our findings, CHO-PET has a comparable accuracy with CT/MRI in HCC. The principle advantage of the modality appears its ability to detect extra-hepatic lesions, which can lead to treatment modification. Furthermore, in-/opposed-phase sequence (Dixon) used for attenuation correction in MR/PET were evaluated. In all images, the diagnostic confidence in identification of nodules was rated on a 4-point scale (1=certain; 4=uncertain). Additionally, the involvement of each lung lobe (primary/metastatic) was assessed. CT scan in inspiration served as reference. The diagnostic performance of each modality was compared in a lesion-and lobe-based analysis. The diagnostic confidence was compared using Wilcoxon test. Results: 48 lung nodules were evaluated. In the lesion-based analysis, sensitivity (false negative rate) of CTex, VIBEin, VIBEex and Dixon was 77% (23%), 52% (48%), 48% (52%) and 25% (75%).

Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between quantitative CT-perfusion parameters and tumour volume with glucose metabolism parameters, in staging of lung cancer patients with 18 FDG PET/CT whole body study. Methods and Materials: Thirty-one patients with biopsy-proven lung cancer, referred for cePET/CT staging, were prospectively enrolled in our study. CTp was performed with following parameters: 120 Kv; 80 mAs; scan 30, during intravenous injection of 50 ml of contrast-agent, flow rate: 5 ml/sec. CTp and cePET/CT data were used to calculate a range of tumour vascularity parameters (blood flow, blood volume and mean transit time) and tumour glucose uptake (SUVmax), and finally correlated with tumour volume using a commercially available software. Four patients were excluded due to the advanced stage of the tumour. CT perfusion parameters were then statistically analysed and compared with those of FDG-PET. Results: Perfusion parameters were calculated with a dedicated software (Perfusion 3.0; Advantage; GE) and a quantitative map of arterial perfusion was generated. Patients were divided into two groups according to tumour volume, with a cut-off of 14 cm3. Linear regression was performed among two groups and statistically significant correlations (P < 0.05) were found between BF and SUVmax (negative correlation) and between MTT and SUVmax (positive correlation) for tumours with volume > 14 cm3. These findings may be due to the inadequate blood inflow typical of larger tumours, with a significant increase of anaerobic metabolism and glucose consumption. Conclusion: CePET/CT perfusion is a feasible technique that offers informations related to the biological tumour behaviour that can be used for planning treatment and for an accurate evaluation of tumour response after therapy.",

Yoshiura, A. Hiwatashi, O. Togao, K. Kikuchi, K. Yoshimoto, H. Honda; Fukuoka/JP (yamakou@radiol.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp) Purpose: To determine whether ASL has an additive diagnostic value to the conventional MR images in differentiating primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) from glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs). Methods and Materials: MR images of 48 patients including 12 with PCNSL and 36 with GBM were retrospectively studied. Two independent neuroradiologists took part in 2 reading sessions. In the first session, the observers read only conventional MR images (T1-weighted image, T2-weighted images, post-contrast images, and DWI with apparent diffusion coefficient maps). In the second session, they read ASL cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps along with the conventional images. The confidence level for the diagnosis (PCNSL versus GBM) was graded on a 5-point scale. Interobserver agreement as well as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were assessed for the two readers. Purpose: Organ-based tube-current modulation (OBTCM) is a technique developed to lower CT radiation dose to anterior dose-sensitive organs. This IRB-approved observational study aimed to establish the location of breast tissue in a female patient in supine position with arms raised over their shoulders. A secondary purpose was to look for possible thresholds of chest diameter and woman's age below or above which the breasts lie in a central location with subsequent possible benefit from OBTCM. Methods and Materials: Informed consent was obtained in 200 consecutive women included. From standard chest CT acquisitions, one 5/5 mm image set with FOV of 500 mm and X and Y coordinates at 0 were obtained. From the gantry rotation centre (x=y=0), the outer and inner angles limiting the breast tissue were measured and compared to the angles (60\u00b0), where OBTCM delivers lowered and increased dose to the organs. Results: Outer angles of breast tissue were < 60\u00b0 for one breast in only two patients. Inner breast angles were > 60\u00b0 in 14/200 patients for at least one breast. No threshold of chest diameter or age was found to predict a central enough location of the breast for OBTCM to be beneficial. Conclusion: Our data show that the angular position of breast tissue is higher than the limit where reduced versus increased radiation dose is delivered in OBTCM. This system should therefore not be applied to CT chest examinations in adult women lying supine. Purpose: To evaluate the effect of an organ-based tube-current modulation (OBTCM) and bismuth shielding on image quality and breast radiation dose in women undergoing low-dose chest CT. Methods and Materials: Low-dose chest CT was obtained from 80 women, who were randomly assigned to a control, OBTCM, breast shield, or breast shield plus OBTCM group. Axial slice images from aortic arch, carina, and inferior pulmonary vein were used to analyse image quality. Three radiologists scored the image quality in terms of artefact and noise, and then designated the overall image quality as optimal (does not affect the diagnostic accuracy) or suboptimal (affects the diagnostic accuracy). Noise levels were measured in the anterior and posterior lung in each image. A phantom dose study was conducted to measure the radiation dose. Results: Images with artefacts or noise were more frequently obtained in the breast shielded groups. The overall image quality was not significantly different among the four groups. Measured noise levels in the anterior lung were significantly higher in the breast shielded groups than the control group; however, no statistical significance was found among the four groups in the posterior lung. In the phantom dose study, a 16-37.5% dose reduction in the breast was achieved using the breast shield and/or OBTCM protocol.",

The \u03b1 value was significantly lower in high-grade gliomas than that in low-grade gliomas (P < 0.001). In addition, the ADCfast, ADCslow and \u03b1 values that were normalised to the values in the contralateral NAWM were all significantly different between high-grade and low-grade gliomas (P < 0.05). Conclusion: IVIM imaging with biexponential and stretched-exponential model is a useful tool in grading cerebral gliomas. The \u03b1 value may be the best parameter for distinguishing high-from low-grade cerebral gliomas. Purpose: This study aimed to determine which combination of acquisition and iterative reconstruction parameters for low-dose MDCT at low tube voltages yields image quality and diagnostic confidence equivalent to current clinical standards in thoracic imaging. Methods and Materials: Thoracic images of eight sedated and mechanically ventilated pigs were acquired with MDCT during mid-inspiratory breath hold using standard (120 kVp, 180 mAs) and low-dose protocols at low tube voltages (100/80 kVp) and current-time products (120/60/30 mAs). Using lung and soft-tissue kernels, images of all acquisitions were reconstructed with filtered backprojection (FBP); low-dose acquisitions were also reconstructed iteratively (levels 2 and 5, iDose, Philips Healthcare). Three independent blinded readers sorted the resulting 19 image data sets per animal according to diagnostic image quality (best to worst), and sorted images were statistically clustered. Additionally, CT numbers and noise have been determined in lung parenchyma, liver, muscle and aorta of all image data sets. Results: Interreader-agreement was moderate-high (\u03ba=0.56-0.66). For any fixed set of acquisition parameters FBP-images were ranked lowest while those reconstructed iteratively (iDose5) were ranked highest independent of reconstruction kernel. The 19 image series could be clustered into 3 homogeneous clusters of equivalent diagnostic quality: Iteratively reconstructed images acquired at 100 kVp/120 mAs (iDose2/5), 100 kVp/60 mAs (iDose5) or 80 kVp/120 mAs (iDose5) were ranked equivalent to FBP-images acquired using standard protocol. Iterative reconstruction did only affect CT numbers at very low dose (80 kVp/30 mAs) while image noise could be reduced by up to ~60%. Conclusion: Using low-kVp and low-mAs protocols combined with iterative image reconstruction, radiation exposure of thoracic MDCT could be reduced by 50-75%. Purpose: To determine utility of adaptive iterative dose reduction using threedimensional processing (AIDR 3D) for pulmonary nodule identification on low-dose 320-detector-row CT using different scanning methods in phantom study.",

            "text": "A chest CT phantom including simulated pulmonary nodule was scanned on a 320-detector-row CT using non-helical wide volume scan (WVS) and helical scans as 64-detector-row CT (64HS) and 160-detector-row CT (160HS) at nine different tube currents. All data sets were reconstructed using AIDR 3D and filter back projection (FBP). To determine the capability of overall identification, two chest radiologists independently evaluated lesion conspicuities by five-point scoring system. At the each scanning method, gold standard was defined as the data set of standard tube current (270 mA) reconstructed by FBP. Interobserver agreements of detection and the capability for radiation dose reduction on each scan method were assessed by kappa statistics and ROC analyses. Results: Interobserver agreements were almost perfect or substantial at all data sets (\u03ba> 0.60). When applied AIDR 3D, area under the curves of data sets equal to or higher than 30 mA on WVS, 40 mA on 64HS, and 40 mA on 160HS had no significant difference with standard data sets (p> 0.05). On the other hand, when applied FBP, radiation dose reduction was limited in comparison with the data sets applied AIDR 3D at all scanning methods. Conclusion: AIDR 3D was more useful for low-dose chest CT examination for nodule screening than FBP, and WVS can reduce more radiation dose than 64HS and 160HS on 320-detector-row CT. Methods and Materials: 50 CTPA studies planned with frontal topogram only (Protocol 1) were compared with 50 CTPA studies planned with frontal and lateral topograms (Protocol 2).Optimal scan length was defined from lung apex to lung base. Excess scan length beyond these landmarks was measured. Mean organ doses to thyroid, liver and stomach were estimated using standard conversion factors. Results: The mean excess scan length was significantly lower in Protocol 2 compared with Protocol 1 (19.5 \u00b1 5.3 mm Vs 39.1 \u00b1 5.3 mm,P < 0.0001). The mean excess scan length below lung bases was significantly lower in Protocol 2 cohort compared with Protocol 1 (7.5 \u00b1 4.2 mm Vs 23.0 \u00b1 4.2 mm,P < 0.0001), as were the mean organ doses to stomach (4.24 \u00b1 0.26 mGy Vs 5.22 \u00b1 0.26 mGy,P < 0.0001) and liver (5.60 \u00b1 0.21 mGy Vs 6.38 \u00b1 0.21 mGy,P < 0.0001).A trend towards reduced over-scanning above the apices in Protocol 2 was observed compared with Protocol 1 (12.0 \u00b1 3.2 mm Vs 16.2 \u00b1 3.2 mm,P= 0.07), with a trend towards lower mean thyroid organ dose in ( Purpose: Volumetric measurement of a nodule is more sensitive in the detection of tumour growth than axial diameter measurement.

Thin section CT Volumetric measurement of the lesions was performed at the same time periods as a second parameter for comparison. The lesion MRI enhancement intensity in each study was estimated, and the ratio to the paraspinal muscle enhancement intensity at the same level was measured (Lesion Muscle Signal (LMS ratio). The correlations between post ablation follow-up CT volume of tumours and CE-MRI LMS ratio at the follow-up periods were assessed. Results: The preablation tumour volumes ranged between 0.30 and 6.1 cm (mean: 1.5 cm\u00b3, SD:1.3). LMS ratio 1 was noted in preablation due to high contrast enhancement of the tumour and in 24-h post ablation due to the inflammatory response associated with the thermal ablation and due to tumour residue or progress. Weak correlation was detected between the LMS-ratios and CT-volumetric changes in 24-h post ablation. Strong correlation between the LMS ratios was estimated between the follow-up periods of 3 months (SpearmanR:0.62,p=0.0021), 6 months (SpearmanR:0.66,p=0.001), 9 months (SpearmanR:0.61,p < 0.001) and 12 months (Spearman R:0.7, p < 0.00001).

Methods and Materials: Forty patients investigated by CT of the cervical spine for chronic neck pain and/or cervical radiculopathy were prospectively randomised into two groups: standard-dose CT (120 kVp, 275 mAs) with FBP, or low-dose CT (120 kVp, 150 mAs) with IR. Image noise, signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-tonoise (CNR) ratios were measured. Two radiologists, blinded to CT parameters, independently assessed the following anatomical structures at C3-C4 and C6-C7 levels, using a four-point scale: intervertebral disc, content of neural foramina and dural sac, ligaments, soft tissues and vertebra.

In the past, trabecular bone structure analysis was limited by the spatial resolution of clinically available MDCT scanners. Recent technical improvements have made it possible to determine trabecular bone structure parameters of the spine using clinical MDCT. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess trabecular bone structure parameters obtained from clinical MDCT as well as Xtreme-CT (hr-pQCT) as standard of reference and to investigate whether clinical MDCT can predict vertebral bone strength. Methods and Materials: Fourteen thoracic vertebral bodies were harvested from formalin-fixed human cadavers (11 women and 3 men; age: 84\u00b110 years). All specimens were examined using Xtreme-CT (isotropic voxel size of 41 \u03bcm\u00b3) and a clinical whole body MDCT (interpolated voxel size: 146x146x300 \u03bcm\u00b3, spatial resolution: 250x250x600 \u03bcm\u00b3). Trabecular bone structure analyses (histomorphometric and texture measures) were performed in the Xtreme-CT as well as MDCT images. Vertebral failure load was determined in an uniaxial biomechanical test. Results: Xtreme-CT and MDCT-derived trabecular bone structure parameters showed correlations ranging from r=0.60 to r=0.90 (p < 0.001). Correlations between trabecular bone structure parameters and failure load amounted up to r=0.86 (p < 0.001) using the Xtreme-CT images, and up to r=0.79 (p < 0.001) using the MDCT images.

In patients with a major impact; 12 had unsuspected nodal involvement, 5 had occult metastases, 2 had synchronous tumours and 1 had negative nodes on PET-CT. These findings either altered radiotherapy treatment planning or treatment intent. During the follow-up period until August 2012, 25% developed disease recurrence following completion of therapy (11% isolated local relapse and 14% distant (\u00b1 local) disease). Conclusion: FDG PET-CT can have a major impact on patient management in locally advanced cervical carcinoma, by detecting occult disease or characterising indeterminate findings on MRI, resulting in an alteration in radiotherapy treatment planning and/or treatment intent in up to one-third of patients.",

Purpose: We report about our approach in imaging patients with cervical cancer using an integrated simultaneous PET/MRI device. Goals were the introduction of a stable and effective protocol for whole body and dedicated pelvic examination and rating of image quality. Methods and Materials: Ten patients with primary (n=4) cervical carcinoma or tumour recurrence (n=6) were included. Patients underwent a simultaneous PET/ MR, PET/CT and conventional MR examination. MR and PET image quality were rated on a Likert score system (0-4) by three radiologists and a nuclear physician. PET data were simultaneously visually compared by two nuclear physicians and a radiologist. Purpose: BRCA1 and BRA2 mutation carriers may be more susceptible to radiationinduced cancer because of their role of tumour suppressor genes in radio-induced DNA damage repair and signalling. Heterozygous mutations of A TM , a major kinase initiating the response to radio-induced DNA double-strand breaks, is likely to be involved in lymphoma as well as in breast cancer in high-risk patient (HRP) treated for a Hodgkin disease.

Methods and Materials: 50 normal volunteers and 50 patients with histopathologically proven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by surgery were included in the study. High-resolution DWI of pancreas was obtained using a multi-section 2D RFOV single-shot echo-planar sequence on the axial plane (FOV 16\u00d78 cm 2 , matrix 128\u00d764). ADC of the normal pancreas in control group and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma group were measured. Mann-Whitney U-test has been used to compare ADC values between tumoral tissues and normal pancreatic tissues of the volunteers. Results: On the high-resolution DW images, all pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma demonstrated high signal intensity relative to the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. The mean and standard deviations of the ADC values (\u00d710 -3 mm2/s) were as follows: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 50), 1.53 \u00b1 0.26 (1.02 -2.23), and normal pancreas in normal volunteers (n = 50), 1.98 \u00b1 0.25 (1.60 -2.73). ADC of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were significantly higher compared with those of normal pancreas (U = 230.000, P = 0.000). Conclusion: RFOV DWI shows advantages in higher resolution (1.25\u00d71.25 mm 2 ) and blurring reduction compared to full FOV DWI of the pancreas. It makes a statistically significant difference on the ADC measurements of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma when comparing to the control group. This approach is promising to benefit the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancers. Purpose: To prospectively evaluate the application of ARFI implemented with virtual touch tissue quantification in the study of pancreatic cystic lesions, using different analysis methods, compared with the final diagnosis (pathological or by MRI/EUS findings). Methods and Materials: 38 patients with pancreatic cystic focal lesion (diameter > 3 cm and located at a depth < 5.5 cm) were included in the study and underwent conventional US. For every patient 5 measurements with virtual touch quantification ROI were performed. In order to distinguish mucinous (potentially malignant) from serous cystic lesions (mainly benign) the result \"XXXX/0\" was considered meaning simple liquids (reportable to water), and the accuracy of virtual touch tissue quantification in differentiating cystic-pancreatic lesions was calculated. To consider the lesion as containing complex fluids (potentially mucinous), two different reading methods have been applied: at least two numerical values when performing five measurements; prevalence of numerical values irrespective of the number of measurements. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy were calculated for the differential diagnosis between mucinous versus non-mucinous cystic lesions. Results: Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy in the group of cystic lesions using the first reading method were, respectively, 68.8%, 77.3%, 68.8%, 77.3%, 73.7%. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy in the group of cystic lesions using the second reading method were, respectively, 37.5%, 100%, 100%, 68.8%, 73.3%. Conclusion: ARFI with virtual tissue touch quantification can have a role in noninvasive characterisation of pancreatic cystic lesion during the conventional US examination. Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of CT perfusion for detection of malignancy in pancreatic masses. Methods and Materials: 27 patients (pts) who presented with a mass in the pancreas were enrolled in this Institute Review Board-approved prospective study after informed consent and underwent biphasic CECT with perfusion CT of the pancreas. Pts were followed up and results of cytopathological diagnosis obtained. Final diagnosis consisted of malignancy (adenocarcinoma) in 11, various benign masses in 13 and neuroendocrine tumour in 3 pts. Control group consisted of 15 pts who were referred for CT for an indication other than pancreatic pathology. 11 perfusion parameters were calculated using software MIStar 3.2 (Apollo imaging software). CT perfusion parameters were compared between the control and study groups as well as results of cytopathological diagnosis using ANOVA and Dunnett 2-sided t-test for statistical analysis. Results: All perfusion parameters except extraction (E) were significantly different between adenocarcinoma and benign groups. All perfusion parameters except permeability (PS) were also statistically significantly different between adenocarcinoma group and controls. Blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), extraction fraction product (EFP), PS and peak enhancement intensity (PEI) showed decreasing trend in values, whereas rest of the parameters showed an increasing trend from normal to benign to adenocarcinoma. Neuroendocrine tumours had different perfusion values with significantly elevated BF, BV, PEI and earlier time to peak (TTP). One patient with pancreatic tuberculosis had perfusion values paralleling adenocarcinoma but with relatively earlier TTP. Conclusion: Perfusion CT seems to be a useful tool for differentiating between malignant and benign pancreatic masses.",

Purpose: To evaluate non-linear image blending in comparison with linear image blending in late phase dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) for the visualisation of delayed myocardial contrast enhancement in acute myocardial infarction (MI) and to identify optimal parameters for non-linear image blending. Methods and Materials: Acute reperfused MI was induced in seven pigs by temporary occlusion of the left anterior descending or left circumflex artery. Two hours after reperfusion contrast-enhanced late phase DECT (80 kV/140 kV) was performed. DECT data were post-processed with linear and non-linear image blending techniques. Contrast and percentage signal difference between healthy and infarcted myocardium as well as the blood pool of the left ventricle were computed for the linear and non-linear techniques including the low and high kV images. Data were compared using repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc t-tests. Results: Non-linear blending showed the highest signal differences for all contrasts and analyses. Repeated measure ANOVAs confirmed these differences to be statistically significant for the different post-processing techniques (p-value ranging from < 0.001 to 0.003). Paired-samples post hoc t-tests proved the significance of these results (p-value ranging from < 0.001 to 0.037). The ideal settings for nonlinear image blending can be deduced from the CT values of the regions of interest in the linearly blended images with the weighting factor 0.3. Conclusion: Non-linear image blending improves the visualisation of acute MI in DECT. Non-linear image blending in late phase DECT of acute MI is superior to linearly blended images as well as source images obtained at 80 kV or 140 kV. Purpose: To assess feasibility and reliability of the Juvenile arthritis MRI scoring system (JAMRIS) for the wrist to evaluate early-stage disease activity, and to compare reliability of JAMRIS for the wrist for early-stage disease with the validated paediatric-targeted MRI scoring system (PTMRIS) for children with more progressive stage of disease. Methods and Materials: MRI datasets from 20 juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients with wrist involvement were evaluated independently by three readers using JAMRIS and PTMRIS. Assessment of early-stage disease activity in JAMRIS was achieved through extending soft tissue scoring items (synovial hypertrophy, tenosynovitis) and specifying the grading of bone scoring items affecting < 25% of the bone (bone marrow changes, bone erosions). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) or Cohen's kappa was used to assess inter-and intrareader reliability. ICC of each JAMRIS scoring item was compared with the ICC of its equivalent in PTMRIS. Results: Three JAMRIS scoring items (synovial hypertrophy, bone marrow changes and bone erosions) showed moderate to good reliability: ICC varied from 0.62 to 0.89 for interreader reliability and 0.28-0.95 (reader 1) and 0.88-0.97 (reader 2) for intrareader reliability. Reliability of tenosynovitis was moderate to poor with Cohen's kappa varying from 0.24 to 0.48 (interreader) and 0.41 to 0.64 (intrareader). JAMRIS and PTMRIS showed similar results of interreader reliability. Conclusion: Early JIA disease activity in the wrist can be reliably evaluated with three-out-of-four features of the simple and accurate JAMRIS scoring system. Correlating clinical disease assessment and responsiveness to change will be needed to validate JAMRIS for the wrist as outcome measure and disease monitoring tool. showing equivocal findings or a bone injury outwith the clavicle. In those found to have clavicle fractures, 32 follow-up radiographs were performed in 26 individuals (4%). Orthopaedic fixation was not performed in any of the identified cases. Conclusion: Despite a high pick-up rate of fractures, clavicle radiographs do not appear to substantially alter clinical management. In our centre, immobilization is the usual management for suspected traumatic clavicle injury, regardless of radiographic appearance. We suggest that, in the context of an experienced paediatric Emergency Department team, radiographs are reserved for patients causing concern at follow-up and are not required routinely at presentation.

There was one case of missed hip dislocation, representing 0.0001% of unexamined patients. No patients with IIC hips at presentation with conservative management represented with a dislocated hip. Radiographs in the treated group demonstrated a satisfactory outcome in 94%. One patient represented with a dislocated hip following erroneous cessation of harness treatment and went on to develop early avascular necrosis. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Conclusion: A delayed approach to managing DDH in infancy allows those patients with ultrasonographically immature hips the opportunity to develop normally without invasive treatment and identifies patients which would most benefit from treatment. This reduces the demand on resources that a DDH screening programme which treated patients more promptly would incur. Within the same financial constraints, this allows more patients to be selected for screening. A delayed approach results in a satisfactory outcome with no subsequent late dislocation in those treated appropriately. Purpose: In cases of hip complaints in the paediatric population it is common practice to acquire both AP and frog-leg lateral (FL) radiographs. The combination of these views has a diagnostic yield, but also doubles the radiation exposure. In our observation, the FL view alone is often diagnostic. We therefore investigated the diagnostic accuracy of obtaining a solitary FL view as compared to a combination of the AP and FL views. Methods and Materials: Children aged 2-15 years who were sent in for hip radiographs between September 2007 and January 2011 were included in the study. Cases of related trauma or a history of hip pathology were excluded. Radiographs were retrospectively assessed by two independent radiologists. Radiologists were blinded for the AP radiograph while assessing the FL radiograph and vice versa and radiographs were presented in a random order. We used the Kappa test to calculate interobserver agreement and agreement between the assessment of both views and the solitary FL view. Results: 524 children (mean age 8.1 yrs) met the study criteria and were included for analysis. 477 children had a normal exam and 47 were considered abnormal. Calculated interobserver agreement using the Kappa test was 0.96. Agreement between the solitary FL view and the combination of the AP/FL view was 0.989.",

Of 640 chest studies, 40% were within conformities and 60% were non-conformities; of 340 abdominal studies, 46% were within conformities and 54% were non-conformities. Foot studies had an almost even distribution of conformities and non-conformities with 51 and 49%, respectively. Conclusion: This research allowed the identification of different types of nonconformities found in radiological images which have impact on imaging quality. Therefore, the existence of adequate quality control of radiographic imaging is essential.",

This retrospective cohort study aims to provide an insight into the use of potentially higher dose computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopyguided examinations in paediatrics, in two national clinical centres of comparable catchment areas in Malta and Ireland. Methods and Materials: Retrospective data, of higher dose diagnostic imaging examinations performed in paediatrics in 2011, was collected from departmental logbooks and radiology information system (RIS) databases of the participating centres. This data included details pertaining to patient's age, type of examination and relevant examination kV, mAs, DAP, fluoroscopy time, CTDI and DLP (if available). Data were categorised according to age and examination type, and effective dose estimates for CT were calculated. Results: In 2011 alone, at least 2,093 CT examinations, 1,532 fluoroscopy-guided procedures and 438 cardiac catheterisation interventions were performed on paediatrics across both centres. Particular complex fluoroscopy-guided interventions had an associated DAP exceeding 10,000cGy.cm2, while effective dose estimates for CT examinations indicated that some paediatric patients may receive a moderate (> 3-20mSv) or high radiation dose (> 20-50mSv). Conclusion: Paediatric patients may undergo examinations that potentially involve a high dose of ionising radiation. Further research to explore the debated issue of benefit-risk communication and consent in paediatric imaging is therefore justified and encouraged, particularly as the study's findings also indicate that repeat or multiple imaging examinations of different anatomical areas are commonly performed in CT. Purpose: To estimate the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of cancer incidence for individual organs following radiation exposure during PCI in the context of two opposite sides of angiographic spectrum of coronary occlusive disease: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and chronic coronary total occlusion (CTO).",

Differences between the visualised field size and the resultant x-ray field size (corrected for magnification) would indicate any collimator errors. On the pelvic phantom minimum textbook collimation was set and then changed in order to simulate a range of possible collimator errors. Phantom examinations used a standard technique with exposure termination using outer AEC chambers. Dose-area-product (DAP) was recorded. Results: Out of nine x-ray rooms all but one produced a smaller irradiated area than was visually set. Errors ranged from a 16% reduction in irradiated field size to a slight over irradiation by 0.4%. With the possibility that these errors could be larger in other institutions a range of (-27% to +18%) errors were simulated. Increasing the field size by 1 cm (superior/inferiorly) increased the DAP by 5%. Laterally, a 1 cm increase caused a 4% rise. Increases of 1 cm in both planes raised DAP by 4%.",

In both cases lumbar spine imaging was conducted in AP and lateral projection with and without the lead shield (in case of the patient study the shielding was used in one group only). The dose was measured by thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) placed at the centre of the breast. Results: Using the lead shielding dose to the right breast was reduced from 0.45\u00b10.25 mGy to 0.09\u00b10.07 mGy (p < 0.001) and the dose to the left breast from 0.26\u00b10.14 mGy to 0.06\u00b10.04 mGy (p < 0.001), compared to the unshielded breast. On average, the breast dose was reduced by approximately 80%. No correlation between the body mass index (BMI) and the breast dose was found.

Rainford; Dublin/IE (marielouise.butler@ucd.ie) Purpose: 'Exposure creep' is a documented phenomenon in computed radiography (CR) where radiation dose is given unnecessarily to patients due to CR's processing capabilities. Manufacturers have responded by developing an exposure index (EI), which is a measurement of detector dose and hence relates to noise in the image. This study aimed to identify how the EI value relates to image quality in clinical practice. Methods and Materials: Three imaging suites and five radiographic examinations were included: ankle and wrist series (antero-posterior (AP) and lateral); AP and lateral lumbar spine; AP pelvis and postero-anterior (PA) chest projections. In total, 306 examinations were documented with a minimum of 10 patients for each projection. Twelve patient images representative of each projection were selected according to their Agfa lgM value; 3 low, median and high lgM values and images recording 3 lgM values closest to the manufacturers' guidelines. Three observers, experienced radiographers (minimum of 6 years working clinically), reviewed the images for noise and overall exposure of the image. In addition the observers indicated what EI value they judged appropriate to image presentation. Results: No significant difference in image quality was noted across the categories of lgM when considering noise (Chi-Square (12)=19.265, p=0.082) or exposure (Chi-Square (12)=18.012, p=0.115). lgM values judged by observers as representative of image quality were lower than those recorded clinically.",

Berger, E. Konen; Ramamt Gan/IL Purpose: Serial CT scans of metastatic tumours are vital in assessing the efficacy of cancer treatment. We evaluated the performance of a novel automated computerized software system that integrates registration, segmentation and tumour measurement into a single process to expedite RECIST measurement with the addition of volume measurement. Methods and Materials: Measurements of long and short-axis of 50 lung metastatic lesions in 18 sequential patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma were manually obtained twice by 3 radiologists. Those measurements were compared with automated software measurements (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY). In addition, the software automatically identified the lesions' contours and volumes; the readers could accept the automated measurement or correct it manually. Intraobserver correlation was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and interobserver reliability by the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and Bland-Altman limits of agreement. Purpose: Clinical guidelines for follow-up of pulmonary nodules depend on nodule type and therefore accurate characterisation of nodules is important. A novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to distinguish solid, part-solid and nonsolid nodules is presented and evaluated on a large data set from a lung cancer screening trial. Methods and Materials: The automated characterisation system is based on a previously published nodule segmentation algorithm. Four different parameter settings were used to extract the solid part, non-solid part and solid core of the lesion. For each segmentation, volume, mass, average density, 5 th percentile and 95 th percentile of densities inside the segmentation were used as features. A k-nearestneighbour classifier was used to classify nodules. The accuracy of the system to differentiate between solid and subsolid nodules, between solid, part-solid and non-solid nodules and between part-solid and non-solid nodules was evaluated. A data set consisting of 137 low-dose chest CT scans (16x0.75 mm, 120-140 kVp, 30 mAs) with 52 solid, 50 part-solid and 50 non-solid nodules was collected from a screening trial.

This procedure, based on manual delineation of the endocardial contours on MR images, is time-consuming due to ventricle's complex shape. We introduce a stereological method for estimating RV parameters from MRI data without the need for image segmentation. Methods and Materials: Twenty-two consecutive patients with coronary artery disease underwent cardiac MRI. Stereological estimations involved the automatic placement of a systematic grid of test points with random orientation over shortaxis images. All points hitting the RV were counted using the semiautomatic point selection process. The optimum point spacing of the grid was defined. The software automatically provided the RV volumes and EF. Two independent observers evaluated the measurement reproducibility. Stereological estimations were compared with those determined by manually tracing RV contours. Results: Acceptable estimations of RV parameters with a mean coefficient of error of 6.9\u00b11.3% were obtained by counting an average of only 12 points per image. The mean time of stereological analysis was 3.7\u00b10.4 min, whereas the intraobserver and interobserver variability was 3.2-5.2% and 4.6-7.8%, respectively. The mean differences between stereology and manual tracing for estimating the end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and EF were small and equal to 4.1\u00b18.0 ml, 2.1\u00b14.6 ml and -0.4\u00b13.5%, respectively.

Reproducibility was significantly higher for Motasso-assisted than for manual measurements, while the time needed for the single measurement could be tremendously reduced using Motasso. Purpose: Plaque treatments carry considerable risk, and hence, adjunct techniques are necessary to help doctors in making a confident decision about the necessity of such procedures for a patient. Mostly, symptomatic patients face a greater risk of cardiovascular diseases, and hence, classification of the plaque into symptomatic and asymptomatic is necessary. Therefore, we have developed a non-invasive computer-aided diagnostic technique for the same. Methods and Materials: Carotid artery images were acquired using multi-detector row CT angiography (MDCTA). The region of interest (ROI) was segmented manually from the images, and the ROIs were used to extract texture-based and discrete wavelet transform-based features. Significant features were used to train and test support vector machine (SVM) classifiers of various kernel configurations.",

Conclusion: A technique that uses the CT images to identify symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques would add more value to this modality in the area of atherosclerosis management. We have proposed and demonstrated the efficiency of one such technique in this work. The classification accuracy is high, and the technique is non-invasive, fast, highly objective, cost-effective and user-friendly. Therefore, it can serve as a valuable adjunct tool that can be used by clinicians in deciding treatment options for patients.",

Intervertebral disk-, rib-and sacrum centre point candidates are extracted next to the spinal canal by the same classification approach. Intevertebral disk centre point labelling is started relative to either ribs or sacrum depending on detection certainty. The labelling run is done iteratively along the spine by obtaining best matches of trained local appearance models to detected three intervertebral disk and spinal canal centre point candidate clusters. Vertebra centres/labels are derived from the intervertebral disk ones. The framework has been trained on 16 and tested on 36 solutions. Accordingly, dedicated software was developed. We evaluated its clinical performance in a series of brain tumours imaged with state-of-the-art 3 T-MRI.

There was a mean of 2.3% over-segmentation using the semi-automated software. The average user time for semi-automated volumetry was 105.3 sec/case, whereas those for manual volumetry were 336 sec/case (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Rapid and accurate semi-automated volumetry of pleural effusions in MDCT is feasible and reproducible. Purpose: To present a paradigm shift in computer-assisted image interpretation and to assess its application in CT colonography. A novel segmentation-free scheme has been developed with the hypothesis that accurate colon segmentation is neither necessary nor an end clinical objective for delivering efficient support such as colon centreline, electronic colon cleansing (ECC) and computer-aided detection of lesions (CAD). Methods and Materials: Thick regions are expanded until they encompass statistically significant representations of the colon wall and its surroundings (Air, Tag, Soft/Hard tissue). From these regions, a coarse colon centreline is inferred through topological analysis guided by anatomic constraints; ECC is obtained by determining a transposing function depicting the distribution of voxels in a given Air-region, and applying said function to Tag-regions depicting statistically similar colon wall surroundings; unlike surface shape analysis, a CAD identifies local hyper-density concentrations from implicit surfaces flux, at a given depth related to the targeted lesion size. The complete schemes were retrospectively tested on 111 and 135 patients datasets for {centreline; electronic cleansing} and CAD, respectively. Results: Colon centreline extraction was accurate in 85% of combined cathartic and tagged datasets. CAD performance was similar to that in the literature, specifically a sensitivity of 80% [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] for lesions at least 7 mm featuring a false-positive rate less than 5 per-patient.",

To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to design and validate such a paradigm shift in CT colonography. Purpose: The role of mesorectal vasculature in rectal cancer is poorly understood. Aim of our study was to determine impact of tumour growth as well as neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on mesorectal vasculature. Methods and Materials: Ten patients with locally advanced rectal cancer underwent (re)staging MRI. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with blood pool contrast agent (gadofosveset) was performed. Maximal intensity projections (MIPs) were used to assess macrovascular structure. Number, diameter and length of vascular branches were determined in mesorectum surrounding tumour and normal rectal wall. Same parameters were used to compare pre-and post-chemoradiotherapy MIPs. The mesorectal microvascular function was studied using relative enhancement-time curves, and expressed as area under the initial 2 minutes of the enhancement curve (AUC). Results: A significantly higher number of vessel branches was found in tumourneighbouring mesorectum compared to mesorectum around normal rectal wall (p=0.001). Furthermore, vessel diameter in tumour surroundings was 0.2 mm larger (p=0.025). The average AUC in tumour-neighbouring mesorectum was also higher (6.35 and 0.58, respectively (p=0.01)). Comparison of pre-and post-CRT MIPs revealed 40% lower vessel branching after CRT (p=0.002). Moreover, the vascular diameter of 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 mm at the primary staging was significantly decreased to 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 mm after CRT (p=0.007). In contrast, CRT resulted in significantly increased AUC values. Conclusion: There is a significantly enhanced vascular structure and function in the tumour-surrounding mesorectum, which may have an important prognostic value for rectal cancer patients. Furthermore, chemoradiotherapy induces remodelling of the mesorectal vasculature.",

Methods and Materials: 32 patients with rectal cancer were prospectively evaluated at 3 T MRI before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Sagittal, coronal, axial and oblique 2D T2w FSE images and an additional 3D T2 FSE Cube sequence were obtained. Each 3D dataset was processed with multiplanar and curved planar reconstructions along the rectal centreline. Two experienced radiologists, using, respectively, 2D or 3D sequences evaluated T and N parameters, with specific attention to measurement of the distance lesion-puborectal muscle and mesorectal fascia, and lesion extension. All T and N parameters were evaluated independently and grouped for statistical analysis. Linear Cohen k values were calculated to quantify agreement between MRI and histopathological data. Image quality was evaluated using a linear qualitative scale. Results: Global sensitivities for T parameters were 67% and 62% for 2D and 3D images, while N category lesion accuracy values were 70% and 68%, respectively. Accuracy in measuring the distance from pubo-rectal muscle to lesion border was 60% and 98% for 2D and 3D, respectively. Image quality was considered very good on 2D images, and good on 3D images. Conclusion: No significant differences between 2D and 3D images were observed for T and N staging. T2w FSE Cube demonstrated higher accuracy than 2D in determining the distance between lesion and pubo-rectal muscle, which represents a key factor in planning surgical resection. Purpose: Spatial vascular heterogeneity decreases from periphery towards tumour core in solid tumours and is related to cancer viability. This pattern is not present in rectal tumours.

Initial slope (slopei) and area under the first 120s of enhancement curve (AUC120) were determined from relative signal enhancement-time curves. Pixel parameter values and mean parameter values were compared per patient and for entire patient group. The correlation between kinetic parameters of tumour segments and of corresponding normal tissues was determined. Results: For each patient, both the slopei and AUC120 were significantly higher for luminal tumour pixels compared to mural and extramural tumour pixels (p < 0.05). Mural pixel parameter values were significantly higher than the extramural pixels (p < 0.05). For the patient group the mean AUC120 for the luminal, mural and extramural tumour region was 240\u00b146, 178\u00b120 and 129\u00b118, respectively. There was a strong and significant correlation between the parameters of tumour segments and those of corresponding normal tissues (Pearson's correlation coef-ficient=0.84, p=0.0001). Purpose: Patients with complete response (CR) after CRT might be considered for less aggressive treatment like a wait-and-see strategy. Few studies investigated the value of DWI-MRI for predicting CR after CRT, but none included lymph nodes in the analysis (ypT0N0). The aim of the present study was to retrospectively determine the additional value of DWI-MRI to conventional (T2-weighted) MRI for predicting CR after CRT. Methods and Materials: Eighty locally advanced rectal cancer patients underwent CRT followed by restaging MRI and operation. MRI consisted of conventional sequences and DWI. Two readers with different levels of experience independently scored conventional images for CR and, in a second reading, combined conventional and DWI-MRI images. A 5-point confidence level score was used to generate ROC curves. Differences in performance were calculated by comparing areas under the ROC curves (AUC). Interobserver agreement, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated. Histology served as reference standard. Results: Ten of 80 patients (13%) had a pathologic complete response (ypT0N0). Comparison of the ROC curves showed significant improvement of the AUC only for the experienced reader 1 from 0.77 to 0.88 (p=0.009). Sensitivity improved from 20-30% to 40-70%. Specificity and PPV improved only for reader 1 from 87 to 93%, resp., 25 to 58%. Interobserver agreement improved from 0.14 to 0.27. Conclusion: Adding DWI to conventional MRI improves diagnostic performance of experienced readers and increases interobserver agreement for identification of CR. Sensitivity and PPV remain low, with a considerable risk of over-and undertreatment. Purpose: Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) is a minimal invasive technique for local resection of T1 and selected T2 tumours and is also an emerging option for good-responders after chemoradiation. In most centres follow-up includes regular MRI. This study aimed to describe the MR morphology of the rectal wall during follow-up in patients that received TEM. Methods and Materials: Forty-nine patients underwent a post-TEM MRI in our centre. For 21 patients only one post-operative MRI was available. For 28 patients > 1 MRIs were available. The MR morphology of the TEM-site was studied on the consecutive MR examinations. 32 patients were primary treated with TEM, 17 patients underwent chemoradiation followed by TEM. Results: We identified three morphological patterns: (1) rectal wall thickening with or without fibrosis, (2) a notch at the TEM-location, and (3) irregular delineation of the rectal wall. Multiple patterns could occur within one patient. 32 patients (65%) had rectal wall thickening, 17 patients (35%) a notch, and 28 patients (57%) irregular delineation of the rectal wall. In addition to these patterns, oedema (due to chemoradiation) persisted in post-chemoradiation TEM-patients. Ten patients had dehiscence after TEM post-chemoradiation (n=58%). Six luminal recurrences occurred; 3 had rectal wall thickening, 3 a notch, and 5 an irregular rectal wall. ",

            "text": "Retrospective study includes 100 patients referred for CTPA with pitch 3.2. 50 patients were scanned with a standard 100 kV protocol and 50 patients were scanned with a simulated ECG-gated 100 kV protocol that introduces a specialized cardiac bowtie filter. All other scanning parameters were kept constant. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection and iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE, Siemens). Central pulmonary vessel attenuation and background noise were quantitatively measured and signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) were calculated. Two radiologists performed qualitative assessment grading visualisation of the pulmonary vasculature and noise level (Likert scale). Volume CT dose index and dose length product were recorded and effective dose was calculated. Purpose: To evaluate the impact of iterative reconstructions on the diagnosis of acute PE on low-dose CT angiograms. Methods and Materials: 53 patients were prospectively enrolled in a study designed to compare low-dose and full-dose images simultaneously available from the same dataset. The examinations were acquired with (a) both tubes set at similar energy (120 kVp) and (b) the total reference mAs (i.e., 110 mAs) split up in a way that 40% was applied to tube A while 60% was applied to tube B. Three series of images were generated: (a) full-dose images (generated from both tubes), reconstructed with FBP (group 1), used as the standard of reference, (b) low-dose images (generated from tube A; 60% dose reduction) reconstructed with FBP (group 2), then with an iterative reconstruction algorithm (SAFIRE) (group 3). Results: All 81 patients showed significant decrease of QS (mean 17.4 to 9.8, p <.001), RLR and AOPA between initial and F/U CT-PA. In 10/81 patients complete PE lysis was found. There was good correlation between reduction of QS and regression of RLR (r=-.506; p <.001) and AOPA (r=-.458; p <.001), respectively. RLR and AOPA changes (r=.330; p=.003) correlated poorly. Patients with initial QS > 20 showed higher reduction of QS at F/U, but no significant difference was found concerning the reduction of RLR between patients with initial QS > 20 and \u00b220 (p=.921). The time interval between initial and F/U CT-PA differed between patients with and without complete lysis (3.5 vs. 2.14 weeks, p=.016). Conclusion: Clot resolution is associated with improvements of RLR and AOPA, but the time to complete resolution is variable and not predictable. RLV and AOPA are independent markers of right heart burden in patients with PE, but they correlate poorly with each other.",

            "text": "We retrospectively evaluated the non-enhanced and enhanced CT findings of 76 patients with pulmonary embolism, and the incidence of high density thrombi was calculated. Then in both iso-density thrombi (group 1) and high-density thrombi (group 2) groups, embolic burden score, ventricular septal bowing, and diameter of right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) were evaluated and compared using independent sample T tests. Purpose: To investigate the general applicability of a 70 kV protocol for routine CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in unselected patients. Methods and Materials: Thirteen patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism underwent CTPA with a novel 70 kV protocol (208 mAs, pitch 1.2) on a 64-slice CT device. Ten patients who were investigated with the standard protocol (100 kV, 120 mAs, pitch 1.2) served as the control group. Images were reconstructed with sinogram affirmed iterative reconstruction with medium regulation strength in both groups. 75 ml of contrast material (350 mgI/ml) was injected at 4 ml/s. CTDIvol, DLP, signal intensity in the pulmonary trunk and segmental arteries and corresponding SNR values were compared. Images were assessed for diagnostic quality and artefacts. Results: Chest diameter was not significantly (p> 0.05) different between the groups. CTDIvol (2.3 vs. 6.6 mGy) and DLP (71 vs. 193 mGycm) were by 65% and 63% lower at 70 kV (p < 0.05); iodine attenuation was significantly higher (e.g. segmental arteries 554 vs. 313 HU), but so was image noise, resulting in no significant differences in SNR. Photon starvation artefacts from dense contrast material in the venous system and high image noise in bigger patients were the main drawbacks at 70 kV. Conclusion: 70 kV CTPA seems feasible in clinical routine and results in a dose reduction of more than 60% compared to a 100 kV protocol at equal SNR; however, patient selection is advisable. Artefacts from inflowing contrast material will require dedicated injection protocols or the use of low-iodine contrast material. Purpose: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease characterised by an elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and is diagnosed invasively via right heart catheterization (RHC). We explored whether timing measures from dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) can be used as a non-invasive method to determine PH. Methods and Materials: 20 patients (15 with and 5 without PH) were examined with a novel dynamic contrast-enhanced CT sequence following their diagnostic or follow-up RHC. X-ray attenuation over time curves were recorded for several regions of interest (ROIs) in the main pulmonary artery and in the ascending aorta and subsequently fitted with a spline fit. Time differences between the contrastmaterial bolus peaks were measured. Distances between the ROIs were measured in a simultaneously acquired thorax CT to calculate the bolus propagation speeds. We compared our results to haemodynamic parameters acquired during RHC. Results: Time differences between peaks showed good correlation (Spearman correlation coefficients \u00b3 0.65) with mean PAP, pulmonary vascular resistance and gas exchange parameters. Discrimination between patients with and without PH was achieved by evaluating time differences (sensitivity/specificity 100%/80%, 95% confidence intervals: 72-100% and 28-99%, respectively) and bolus speeds (sensitivity/specificity 100%, 95% confidence intervals: 72-100% and 48-100%, respectively). ) . Lesions located in the vertebral body were excluded, while lesions in proximity to joints or neurovascular bundles were included. Treatment success was determined at clinical and imaging follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment. A visual Analog Pain Score (VAS) was used to assess changes in symptoms. Results: Treatment was carried out using a variable number of sonications (mean 4\u00b11.8) with a mean energy deposition of 866\u00b1211 J. There were no treatment-or anaesthesia-related complications. A statistically significant (p=0.001) difference was noted between the overall pre-and post-treatment mean VAS scores (8.3\u00b11.6 and 0.6\u00b11.5, respectively). Six of the 7 treatments were conducted on patients with typical osteoid osteoma and all were completely clinically successful. The patient with giant osteoma had pain recurrence after 2 weeks, requiring surgery. At imaging, oedema and hyperemia associated with typical osteoid osteoma gradually disappeared in all lesions. No apparent relationship between nidus vascular extinction and successful outcome was found. Conclusion: MRgFUS ablation represents an effective and totally non-invasive therapeutic option for osteoid osteoma management, without treatment-related adverse events. Purpose: Radiographic damage was recently identified as a feature of poor prognosis in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA). However, most radiographic studies did not differentiate pJIA from other subtypes of JIA and little is known in pJIA persisting into adulthood. We set out, therefore, to describe radiological peripheral involvement in young adults with pJIA as compared to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Methods and Materials: All consecutive pJIA patients followed in a transition program were included. Age, sex, disease duration, and treatment information were collected. Laboratory tests and standard radiographs of the hands and wrists, feet and hips were then analysed by two independent radiologists blinded to the diagnosis. A RA control group (< 55years), matched for sex and disease duration, was recruited. D\u00fcsseldorf/DE (Rotem.Lanzman@med.uni-duesseldorf.de) Purpose: The purpose of our study was to investigate changes in kidney perfusion following renal denervation using arterial spin labelling (ASL) MRI at 1.5 T. Methods and Materials: 7 patients (mean age 58 \u00b1 13 years) undergoing interventional renal denervation were included in this study. In each patient, between 6 and 8 ablations were performed per renal artery. ASL MRI was performed at 1.5 T using a single-slice FAIR TrueFisp sequence in the coronal plane (30 averages of label and control pairs, inversion time 1200 ms, slice thickness 8 mm, matrix 128x128) prior to and within 24 hours following renal denervation. Patients refrained from fluid intake for at least 2 hours prior to the examination. Following post-processing, ROIs were drawn by a single reviewer on ASL parameter maps for quantification of cortical perfusion. Both kidneys of each patient were used for statistical analysis. Results: Image acquisition was completed successfully in all patients and perfusion was determined for 14 kidneys in 7 patients. In 6 patients, ASL perfusion increased by at least 10% following denervation, while in one patient ASL perfusion decreased following intervention. Mean ASL perfusion following renal denervation (245.8 \u00b1 43.3 ml/100 g/min) was significantly higher than prior to denervation ( Purpose: To evaluate trochlear morphology as a potential risk factor for patellofemoral osteoarthritis, determined by morphological and quantitative measurements of cartilage degeneration using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee. Methods and Materials: MR images of right knees of 304 randomly selected subjects, aged 45-60 years, from the osteoarthritis initiative (OAI) progression cohort were screened for trochlear dysplasia, defined by a pathological trochlear depth. Out of 304 subjects, n=85 demonstrated a shallow trochlea (depth \u00b23 mm; 28%). In these, and also in a random sample of controls with normal trochlear depth (n=50), we calculated the facetal ratio and assessed knee structural abnormalities using a modified Whole-Organ-MR-Imaging Score (WORMS). Cartilage segmentation was also performed and T2 relaxation times and patellar cartilage volume were determined. ANOVA and multivariate regression models were used for statistical analysis of the association of MRI structural measures and trochlear morphology. Results: Knees with a shallow trochlea showed higher patellofemoral degeneration (WORMS mean \u00b1 standard deviation, 11.2\u00b14.6 versus 5.7\u00b14.2; multivariate regression, P < 0.001) and lower patellar cartilage volume than controls (900\u00b1664 mm3 versus 1671\u00b1671 mm3, P < 0.001). Knees with a pathological facetal ratio showed increased patellofemoral WORMS scores (8.3\u00b14.6 versus 2.3\u00b16.3, P < 0.001). T2 values at the patella were significantly lower in the dysplasia group. However, significance was lost after adjustment for cartilage volume (multivariate regression, P=0.673). Conclusion: Trochlear dysplasia, defined by a shallow trochlea, is associated with higher WORMS scores and lower cartilage volume, indicating more advanced osteoarthritis at the patellofemoral joint.",

X-rays were scored by the Wassenberg scoring system. Results: Median symptom duration at inclusion was 12 months. 58% had polyarticular and 38% mono/oligoarticular PsA. At the first evaluation 60% had Wassenberg score zero. At the 5-year visit median score was 2. In 34 patients (44%) the score was still 0, in 28 between 1 and 5, in 5 between 6 and 10, in 6 between 11 and 15, and 1 patient each had a score of 19, 22, 39, and 42. At baseline women had significantly higher disease activity than men, but similar x-ray score. At 5 years men had improved considerably in function and disease activity score, but had greater x-ray progression (58% vs 28%, p=0.009). Male gender was a significant predictor of x-ray progression. Longer symptom duration at entry predicted x-ray progression (p=0.038) and prevented minimal disease activity (p < 0.001). Conclusion: After 5 years of PsA, most patients still have no or very little hand joint destruction. Symptom duration at inclusion and male gender were the main predictors of x-ray progression, preserved function at baseline was protective. Despite worse clinical outcome with higher disease activity scores, women had less x-ray progression than men. Purpose: Cortical thickness mapping is a technique that uses clinical computed tomography (CT) imaging to plot the distribution of cortical bone thickness in 3D. Given our understanding of their relationships with bone mineral density, we performed a study to investigate the effects of age, weight, and osteophytes on cortical bone distribution in the proximal femur.",

A DICOM analysis tool (Stradwin) was used to contour each hip semi-automatically and create a 3D surface mapped with individual cortical thickness values. Statistical parametric mapping was then performed to investigate model effects of age, weight and osteophytes on cortical thickness. Results: Cortical thickness was generally thinner with advancing age, but was preserved in characteristic load-bearing regions at the medial femoral neck and lateral subtrochanteric cortex. Greater weight was also associated with significantly thicker cortex per kilogram at these same sites. Including osteophytes in the model showed that increasing severity was detected as increasingly thick cortical bone around the articular margin at the femoral head-neck junction. Conclusion: These results demonstrate, for the first time, the effects of age, weight and osteophytes on cortical bone thickness in the proximal femur. It will be essential for future analysis of bone in this region to take these effects into account. Conclusion: Raw-data-based iterative reconstruction significantly improved image quality in very-low-dose prospectively ECG-triggered coronary DSCT angiography when compared to standard reconstruction using FBP. Along with substantial reduction of radiation exposure, iterative reconstruction also shows a trend towards higher accuracy in coronary stenosis detection compared to FBP. ",

In addition, a colour-coded map of myocardial iodine distribution was calculated from DECT data. Two independent blinded radiologists reviewed all images for late enhancement areas in standard cardiac views and rated subjective image quality. Results: DECT data from 100 kV, WA-80% and WA-60% showed identical results for the correct identification of myocardial scarring (89% sensitivity, 98% specificity and 96% accuracy). However, WA-60% received the best subjective image quality rating and average measured infarct size correlated best with MRI. Colour-coded iodine distribution maps were prone to artefacts (52% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 81% accuracy), overestimating quantity of scars while underestimating lesion size by 55% compared to MRI. Conclusion: Linear blending of delayed phase cardiac DECT data improves image quality for the detection of myocardial scar tissue compared to MRI. Colour-coded myocardial iodine distribution maps were prone to artefacts and showed inferior diagnostic performance. ",

The images were reconstructed with filtered backprojection (FBP) and increasing percentages of IR of 20-100%. The amount of calcium was determined as an Agatston score. The influence of percentage IR on both total Agatston score (TAS) of the phantom as well as the individual calcium score (IAS) for each calcification was investigated. Purpose: To demonstrate that diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is able to pick up intracranial recurrences of medulloblastoma (MB) with higher sensitivity than contrast-enhanced (CE) series.

Routine follow-up examinations were performed initially 3 months after operation and thereafter, every 6 months for the next 2 years. Then, controls were done yearly. Concomitant cranial and spinal MRI included T1, T2, and FLAIR in the axial plane, followed by T1 after gadolinium (Gd) in 3 orthogonal planes for the brain. Additional DWI was performed. Subsequent spinal imaging included sagittal T1-en T2-weighted images. Results: Eleven recurrences were observed in 10 patients. In 5 patients recurrent disease was observed at the resection site in 2 of which subarachnoid spread was also observed, with recurrence in loco only in 3 patients.

Obara 2 ; 1 Fukuoka/JP, 2 Tokyo/JP Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of 3D turbo field echo (TFE) with diffusionsensitized driven-equilibrium (DSDE) preparation, which is a novel non-EPI technique for diffusion-weighted imaging, for pituitary adenoma in sella turcica. Methods and Materials: This prospective study included thirteen patients (9 females and 4 males, age 19-82 years) with pituitary adenomas were imaged with 3D TFE with DSDE preparation. Among them four were prolactin-producing (PRL), three were growth hormone-producing (GH) and six were non-functioning tumours (NON). Motion probing gradients were conducted at one direction (A-P) with b values of 0 and 500 s/mm 2 . The imaging voxel size was 1.5x1.5x1.5 mm 3 . The apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured in the pituitary adenoma and the normal pituitary gland. Results: In each patient, a pituitary adenoma was clearly visualised on 3D TFE with DSDE preparation and ADC maps without obvious geometrical distortion. ADC of the pituitary adenoma ranged from 0.57 to 2.90 x10 -3 mm 2 /s (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, 1.37\u00b10.72 x 10 -3 mm 2 /s), and was higher than that of the normal pituitary gland (1.34\u00b10.23 x 10 -3 mm 2 /s) without statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). ADC in PRL (2.07\u00b10.92 x 10 -3 mm 2 /s) was significantly higher than that in GH (0.86\u00b10.31 x 10 -3 mm 2 /s) and in NON (1.17\u00b10.32 x 10 -3 mm 2 /s) (P < 0.05). Conclusion: With its insensitivity to field inhomogeneity and high spatial resolution, 3D TFE with DSDE preparation was feasible to evaluate the diffusivity in the pituitary gland. ADC measurement using this new technique may help characterise hormone activity of pituitary adenomas.",

A clinical performance study comparing two-view (CC, MLO) mammography, and the combination of DBT in MLO view and MX in CC-view (DBT+MXCC) was conducted with six breast radiologists. Data were analysed per-lesion, using lesion localisation fraction -LLF (the percentage of lesions correctly localised). Lesion detection was determined by calculating the total number of lesions rated above BI-RADS 1. Lesion characterisation was evaluated by counting malignant lesions rated above BI-RADS 3 and benign lesions scored BI-RADS 2 or 3. Lesion detection and characterisation for all lesions, and stratified for malignant and benign lesions, were compared between DBT+MXCC and MX using analysis of variance (ANOVA).

That was due to the higher signal-to-lesion ratio of FLAIR sequences in comparison with the others. In fact, on FLAIR sequences the mean value of contrast to lesion ratio of bladder neoplasm was 33.1 while on SE T1-weighted sequences and TSE T2-weighted sequences was, respectively, 15.2 and 29.2. FLAIR sequences allowed the detection of small papillomas (< 2 mm). TSE T2-weighted sequences were more sensitive than other sequences in the study of bladder wall infiltration.

Methods and Materials: Thirty consecutive patients, presenting with gross haematuria and trans abdominal ultrasound suggestive of mass in the bladder were taken up for study. All patients underwent conventional cystoscopy and CISS 3D MR imaging and the images reconstructed for virtual cystoscopy using volume rendering technique. Lesions were detected and the number, size, location and morphologic features of lesions were noted. Subsequently, patients underwent conventional cystoscopy, and the findings were noted. The final diagnosis of the cases was established by histopathology. Results: Sixty-five lesions were seen in MR virtual cystoscopy and 69 in conventional cystoscopy. The smallest lesion identified on MR virtual cystoscopy was 3 mm. Overall sensitivity and specificity of MR virtual cystoscopy for lesion detection were 94.2 and 100%, respectively. For lesions greater than 5 mm, the detection rate was 98%.Pearsons correlation test showed a good between virtual and conventional cystoscopy for maximum and minimum diameters of the lesion (0.98 and 0.92, respectively). Location of the lesions and their morphological characteristics were found to correspond by both methods. Conclusion: MR virtual cystoscopy is an effective tool in the detection of urinary bladder tumours, especially those larger than 5 mm. When bladder lesion is less than 5 mm a sessile conventional cystoscopy is better than MR virtual cystoscopy. Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a diagnostic imaging technique called voiding MR cystourethrography. Methods and Materials: 10 normal volunteers and 86 male patients with bladder outlet obstruction (evaluated with urine-flow velocity recording) underwent voiding MR cystourethrography. The MR examination was performed with 1.5 T superconductive magnet. The filling of the urinary bladder with paramagnetic contrast agent was obtained by the i.v. administration of furosemide followed by \u00be of the normal dose of a paramagnetic contrast agent. During the micturition two consecutive T1-weighted spoiled 3D gradient-echo acquisitions on sagittal plane were performed. 3D row images were post-processed with MIP algorithm. 25 patients performed retrograde and micturating conventional cystourethrography in the month preceding MRI. Results: Homogeneous opacification of the bladder lumen was always obtained. 10 patients were unable to perform the MR examination. In all the volunteers and in all the patients studied (76 pts), a perfect evaluation of the male urethra with MRI was obtained and its visualisation with MIP reconstructed images was considered comparable to that obtained with conventional cystourethrography. Site, length and number of urethral strictures were accurately determined. The analysis of 3D sagittal scans allowed a better evaluation of the morphology of the urethral strictures in comparison with conventional cystourethrography. Conclusion: Voiding MR cystourethrography demonstrates the morphology of the bladder neck and urethra during the micturition and can substitute standard cystourethrogram, avoiding radiation exposure to the gonads and urinary catheterization.",

Main/DE (mail@borisschulz.com) Purpose: To evaluate efficiency of sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction technique, regarding noise and image quality on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the liver. Methods and Materials: CT examinations were performed upon 32 patients (128 slice CT, 120 kV, 180 mAs, activated tube current modulation, 0.6 mm collimation). Each examination was reconstructed at standard filtered back projection (FBP) and 5 different SAFIRE strengths in 5 mm images in transversal direction with soft tissue kernel. Image noise was defined as standard deviation (SD) of Hounsfield units (HU) in air, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the liver was defined as mean liver HU per liver SD. Subjective image quality was evaluated by three raters using a 5-point scale (1=non-diagnostic image quality, 5=excellent image quality). Results: Average image noise was 6.2 HU (FBP), vs. 5.7 HU (SAFIRE 1), vs. 5.0 (SAFIRE 2) 4.4 HU (SAFIRE 3), 3.8 HU (SAFIRE 4), 3.1 HU (SAFIRE 5).

Overall success rate is 54-80%; however, a failure rate of 20-45% is reported. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse morphologic changes visible on MRI after sling procedure in incontinent patients and compare with the continent ones, in order to detect possible factors explaining the different clinical outcome. Methods and Materials: 16 patients treated with advance sling were enrolled: 8/16 had clinical recovery while 8/16 had persistent incontinence. MR protocol performed with a 3 T system included 3D T2w sequence (cube) and a high temporal resolution Fiesta for dynamic MRI. On the T2w sequence, the length of the bulbus posterior to the sling and the distance of the sling from a line parallel to the symphysis pubis (LSP), were measured. Mann-Whitney test was used to analyse the results. Results: In the 8 incontinent patients the length of the bulbus posterior to the sling was < 8 mm (range 4-8 mm) while in the continent ones was > 12 mm (12-23 mm) (p < 0.001). The sling position was located posterior to the LSP in 7/8 incontinent patients (4-12 mm) and almost coincident in 6/8 continent patients (p=0.04). Conclusion: Based on our results, the length of the bulbus posterior to the sling seems to strongly correlate with continence. Although our results must be confirmed in a larger series, surgeons should consider this element in planning the proper position of the device.",

Each one of the iterative medium-smooth filter (I26-I30-I31) was reconstructed at 3 different strengths (S3-S4-S5) for a total of 20 image series. For each series, 8 virtual spherical lesions were simulated in random positions on the liver. A lesion-to-liver contrast (LLC) of +20 HU was selected for DE-composition 0.5 and +30 HU for 80 kV, according to a preliminary study on 20 HCCs acquired with DECT. Four expert radiologists performed a detectability test and rated the overall quality, noise and sharpness (5-point scale) in all images. Results: 2/32 lesions were detected with FBP-B20f. In all the iterative reconstructions, the strength-5 kernels led to detect 23\u00b11.2/32 lesions. The highest image quality ratings were 3.3\u00b11.3 (B20f), 3.5\u00b10.7 (I30-S3 DE-composition 0.5) and 3.1\u00b11.2 for I30-S5 DE-composition 0.5, without a statistical difference (ANOVA test). All subjective ratings in the 80 kV series were defined as suboptimal (2.3\u00b10.3).

The development of a specific CT liver detection algorithm delivers higher radiation exposure to the liver with the aim of improving quantum noise, and correspondingly less radiation to the remaining abdomen. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of this algorithm on reducing noise in the liver. Methods and Materials: 80 consecutive patients for abdominal CT with same level of iterative reconstruction were included. There was no exclusion. The CT liver detection algorithm was enabled in the last 40 of these patients. Region of interest in Hounsfield units and standard deviation (SD) were measured in the left and right lobes of liver, spleen, psoas and bladder for all patients. Radiation doses were also recorded. The results of the two groups were compared. Results: SD reflected noise. In the liver detection algorithm group, there was a SD reduction by 10.1% in the right liver, 15.61% in the left liver and 15.83% in spleen. No significant change of SD was seen in psoas and bladder.

For qualitative analysis a 5-point scale was used. Contrast ratios were calculated for quantitative assessment. Results: Contrast-enhanced T1w MRC at 7T showed a homogeneous depiction of the intra-and extrahepatic biliary tract with a maximum enhancement 20 minutes post-contrast. VIBE and FLASH IR provided a good image quality for the intra-(VIBE 3.60, FLASH IR 3.67) and extrahepatic bile ducts (VIBE 3.50, FLASH IR 3.72). Quantitative analysis revealed high CR values for FLASH IR (CR 0.41 intrahepatic and 0.45 extrahepatic) due to a strong signal decrease of hepatic tissue and vessels. T2w TSE at 7T revealed a poor image quality without diagnostic potential (2.22 intrahepatic, 1.93 extrahepatic). 7T VIBE and FLASH provided superiority in the depiction of the intrahepatic bile ducts, while 3 T MRC was superior in the delineation of the extrahepatic biliary tract. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of contrast-enhanced imaging of the biliary ducts at 7T, particularly T1w FLASH with inversion recovery enables high-quality assessment of the biliary tract. Purpose: Volume rendering 3D-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is able to show auditory pathways between the cochlea and the cerebellopontine angle in children with negative auditory brainstem responses and cochlear nerve structures undetectable by conventional high-resolution (HR) MRI. Methods and Materials: Twelve children (mean age \u00b1 43.8 mo) with confirmed severe hearing loss by ABR (auditory evoked brainstem responses) underwent HR-CT and HR-MRI of the petrous bone. In addition, three-dimensional T2-weighted turbo spin-echo axial slices were obtained at 1.5 T and maximum intensity projections and 3D volume reconstructions were performed for visualisation of the cochlear anatomy. Results: Abnormal cochleovestibular anatomic findings such as incomplete partition type I (n=1), incomplete partition type II (n=1), narrow internal auditory canal (n=3), splitting of the internal auditory canal and concomitant anomalies of the posterior labyrinth (n=2) were detected by HR-CT and HR-MRI. Interestingly, volume-rendered 3D inner ear reconstructions detected varying but communicating structures of the cochlea and the brainstem in all 12 cases. After cochlear implantation all twelve children showed obvious hearing reactions. Conclusion: In contrast to conventional HR-MRI, 3D-MRI volume-rendering reconstructions are useful to detect aberrant and even tiny auditory path structures derived from the cochlea. Children with severe hearing loss and HR-MRI-based findings of missing cochlear nerve structures should be further screened with volume rendering 3D-MRI during cochlear implantation evaluation. Purpose: Cochlear nerves aplasia represents a rare but possible congenital cause of Sensori Neural Hearing Loss (SNHL) in children. Early identification and accurate diagnosis are mandatory to correctly select auditory brainstem implantation (ABI) candidates. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the contribution of a complete pre-operative radiological assessment based on CT and MRI to prevent misdiagnosis and erroneous treatments. Purpose: To correlate patient diameters and subjective image quality in low-voltage and standard-voltage CT of the upper abdomen in the same patient population, with the goal of identifying cutoff patient diameters for selecting patients for lowvoltage scans. Methods and Materials: 32 patients underwent MDCT of the abdomen with arterial phase at 80 kV with angular dose modulation on 64-row MDCT (test group). This was compared to a previous 120-kV scan on the same scanner. Mean interval between scans was 139 days. Patient transverse and sagittal diameters were measured at celiac axis level, and the mean was calculated. Two radiologists by consensus graded image quality on a 5-point scale (5=excellent; 4=good; 3=moderate; 2=poor; 1=non-diagnostic; 3 was the chosen cutoff quality). Image quality was correlated to the transverse, sagittal and mean diameter by means of an ANOVA test. Results: Patient diameters were unchanged across exams (all p=ns). In 80-kV scans, image quality was significantly correlated to sagittal (p=0.034) and mean diameters (p=0.025), while a trend to significance was observed for transverse diameter (p=0.053). In 120-kV scans, image quality was not significantly correlated to patient diameters (all p=ns), and all patients received grade 4 or 5. In 80-kV scans, a subjective grade 3 corresponded to a transverse diameter of 329 mm and a sagittal diameter of 267 mm. Conclusion: Subjective image quality in low-voltage scans appears to be more influenced by patient size than at standard voltage scans. For our protocol, cutoff diameters for adequate image quality are transverse 329 mm and sagittal 267 mm.",

Four curved MIPs of the meningeal spaces with different thicknesses were rendered for each patient. Four radiologists independently evaluated all cases. Hematomas of less than 3 mm thickness were considered 'thin' throughout this study. The radiologists were blinded to patient names, and patient and group order was randomised. The results were compared to a standard of reference built by two experts. Logistic regression with repeated measurements was used for statistical analysis. Results: 121 intracranial hematomas were confirmed in 39 patients. For all readers, the reading time for hematoma detection was significantly shorter (3 -5 times, P <.001)) for curved MIPs. The mean lesion-based detection rate of all readers was 80% (193/242) for transverse sections and 83% (200/242) for curved MIPs. For thin hematomas, the mean detection rate rose from 20% (8/40) with transverse sections to 83% (33/40) with curved MIPs. specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were calculated and compared among the two groups. Results: Of the 240 patients, underlying echogenicity of thyroid was heterogeneous in 55 patients (22.9%), and homogenous in 185 patients (77.1%). Forty-four (18.3%) of the 240 patients had multifocal lesions in one lobe, and 77 (32.1%) had bilateral lesions on pathologic examination.

Methods and Materials: 59 patients with thyroid nodules, who underwent to grey-scale ultrasonography (US), elastography and FNC (Fine-Needle Cytology), were prospectively enrolled from February to August 2012. For each nodule, grey-scale US parameters (hypoechogenicity, absence of halo sign, absence of colloid) were examined. Findings at elastography were classified according to Rago criteria (2010). Cytological diagnosis were classified according to the SIAPEC-IAP criteria in Tir1, Tir2, Tir3, Tir4 and Tir5. The diagnostic performance of grey-scale US and elastography were compared with cytological findings. Tir1 and Tir3 with indeterminate cytology were excluded from the study. Results: 48 nodules were included: 41 Tir2, 3 Tir4 and 4 Tir5. According to Rago criteria 32 nodules were score 1, 2 nodules score 2 and 14 nodules score 3. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of elastography were 71%, 78%, 35%, 94%, respectively. The combination of grey-scale US parameters (hypoechogenicity with absence of halo sign and colloid) showed 57% sensitivity, 76% specificity, 28% PPV and 91% NPV. Conclusion: Elastography is not useful in the differentiation of malignant and benign thyroid nodules. However, elastography had a high probability in predicting cytological benign diagnosis (high VPN). Moreover, elastography demonstrated a superior performance than the combination of grey-scale US parameters.",

During ultrasound examination, 96 dominant nodules were examined with strain elastosonography with Aplio XG with linear 5-17 MHz transducer. The stiffness of each thyroid nodule was evaluated with classical features of strain elastosonography qualitatively (with elasticity scores) and semi-quantitatively with thyroid tissue strain/nodule strain ratios with application of elasto Q. Moreover, a novel, original approach to elasticity data based on evaluation of time-strain curves was applied. Results: 7 papillary carcinomas, 89 benign nodules. Classical elastosonographic analysis with elasticity score and elasticity ratio on statistical analysis did not show significant difference between cancer and benign nodules (p-value, respectively, 0.431 and 0.156).

Further large-scale studies evaluating the usefulness of linear/non-linear elastosonography phenomena (involving evaluation of vioscoelasticity, e.g. shear wave spectroscopy) in differential diagnostics of thyroid cancer are warranted. Methods and Materials: This HIPAA compliant retrospective study was IRB approved. We included 52 patients who had undergone emergent CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis for abdominal pain with tube current modulation, automated kVp selection and SAFIRE (Scan A) and compared their abdomen and pelvis CT scans with tube current modulation, 120 kVp, filtered back projection reconstruction algorithm (Scan B). CTDIvol, DLP, effective dose (DLP x k) and image noise values were compared between two protocols. Paired samples Wilcoxon test was used for analysis and P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The median CTDIvol were 12.73 mGy and 18.26 mGy for Scans A and B, respectively (P=0.0002); the median DLPs for Scans A and B were 583.00 mGycm and 888.50 mGycm (P < 0.0001), respectively. The median effective dose was 34.38% lower with Scan A compared with Scan B (8.74 mSv vs. 13.32 mSv, P < 0.0001). The median image noise was significantly lower with Scan A using SAFIRE (11.05 vs. 14.15, P < 0.0001). Results: 100 kV were automatically selected in 82 patients, 120 kV in 12 patients and 140 kV in 6 patients of the autokV group. Patient diameters increased with higher kV settings. The average CTDIvol (9.4 vs. 12.9 mGy) and DLP (669 vs. 925 mGycm; p < 0.05) in the entire autokV group were 27%/28% lower than in the group with fixed 120 kV. This effect was even more pronounced in the patients in whom 100 kV were selected (CTDIvol 8.1 mGy, -37%; DLP 571 mGycm, -38%). Enhancement of parenchymal organs gradually increased with lower kV, while image noise was at a stable level. Conclusion: Software-based automated selection of the tube potential allows for significant dose savings in thoraco-abdominal trauma CT while image quality is maintained or even improved.

We assessed, NIHSS on admission (NIH adm), DWI-ASPECT score, TIC types, successful recanalization (SR), NIHSS on the 7 th day (NIH 7 th ), and in-hospital death. Early neurological improvement (ENI) was defined as NIH adm-NIH 7 th > 0. TICs were generated on region of interests set at symmetrical positions of the bilateral MCA territories. According to the time to peak (TP) and the peak signal (PS) comparing the affected side (a) with the contralateral side (c), we classified TIC into four types and defined type 1 as TPa>TPc and PSa<PSc/2, type2 as TPa>TPc and PSc/2<PSa<PSc, type3 as TPa>TPc and PSa>PSc, and type 4 as TPa=TPc. Relationship between TIC types, in-hospital death and ENI were assessed. Results: Eighty-seven patients were analysed. There were 36, 39, 12 and 0 patients in TIC type 1, 2, 3 and 4, 39 patients underwent reperfusion therapy (RT) and SR was achieved in 18 patients, and 29 patients died. TIC type 1 was the only determinant of in-hospital death (p < 0.01) and SR coupled with TIC type 2 was the determinant of ENI (p < 0.01).

Forensic autopsies are disposed not only with regional differences but, however, also with on an average decreasing frequency. Especially in patients who died during trauma room management or emergency operation during critical care, no imaging could possibly be performed. Therefore, after termination of all clinical procedures a critical analysis of death and evaluation of the standards of medical care is often not possible, although especially regarding medical quality management it is highly desirable.

Methods and Materials: 130 consecutive children undergoing chest CT studies on a dual-source CT system were prospectively evaluated with a 70-kV scanning protocol. All scanning parameters were kept similar to those usually selected for standard 80-kV protocols, except the milliamperage. Always selected according to the patient's weight, ref mAs were increased by a factor of 1.6 to maintain comparable levels of radiation dose between newly introduced 70-kV and routine 80-kV protocols. Image quality at 70 kV (group 1) was compared to that of a paired paediatric population (group 2) based on the age (\u00b11yr), weight (\u00b11 kg) and administration of contrast material, previously scanned at 80 kV on the same CT unit and prospectively stored in our database. Group 1 and group 2 images were reconstructed with filtered-back projection. Results: Objective noise in group 1 was significantly lower than that measured in group 2 (9.9\u00b16.3 HU vs 11.3\u00b16.6 HU; p=0.03). Subjective image quality of lung and mediastinal images in group 1 did not significantly differ from that of group 2 (p=0.18). In group 1, the mean dose-length-product was 15.4\u00b12.3 mGy.cm (< 1yr; mean weight: 5.3 kg) (n=35); 18.3\u00b12.1 mGy.cm (1-5yr; mean weight: 13.4 kg) (n=44), 24.4\u00b13.9 mGy.cm (5-10yr; mean weight: 24.7 kg) (n=33) and 31.7\u00b14.7 mGy.cm (10-15yr; mean weight: 33.1 kg) (n=18). Conclusion: Paediatric chest CT at 70 kV provides similar objective and subjective image quality to that achievable at 80 kV. Results: From the records in the database, various anthropometric data were extracted, e.g. body mass and body length of more than 33000 patients, thoracic diameters and the volumes, densities and masses of lungs and mammalian glands of more than 2000 patients of all age groups. These data were compared to the anthropometric data of the mathematical MIRD phantoms provided by the Finnish centre for radiation safety STUK. It can be shown that in mathematical MIRD phantoms of all age groups, body mass, body length and thoracic diameters are overestimated, whereas lung volumes and lung masses are underestimated.

CT examinations consisted of contrast-enhanced (n=190) and noncontrast (n=316) studies, obtained in the context of acquired (n=280; 55%) or congenital (n=46; 9%) bronchopulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis (n=60; 12%), cardiovascular disease (n=91; 18%), oesophageal atresia (n=8; 1%) and miscellaneous causes (n=21; 4%). All examinations were of diagnostic image quality. The mean DLP value in each age category was 14.29\u00b13.38 mGy.cm ( Purpose: To standardise the scan protocol for CT scanners of participating centres in a multi-centre study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01270074) for the prevention of radiologically defined bronchiectasis in CF infants by ensuring the maximum image quality at the minimum radiation dose. Methods and Materials: Three different sized phantoms (QRM, Germany) were used to assess scanners' performance of automatic exposure control (AEC). CTDI and DLP were recorded. The phantoms contained various inserts to assess slice-sensitivity-profile, in-plane spatial resolution, noise and the Hounsfield Unit (HU) scale. Scans were made for several dose levels and reconstruction kernels. Images were analysed with custom-made software (MatLab, USA) to obtain the standard deviation of the noise, point-spread-function (PSF) and slice thickness. Results: Eight different scanners with 64 slices or more from 4 manufacturers (GE, Philips, Siemens and Toshiba) were assessed. Despite differences in AEC's performance, we obtained approximately the same dose level at each center by recommending site and age-specific AEC reference levels. A constant image quality was only possible by matching the different reconstruction kernels measured PSFs at full-width-at-half-maximum. In fact, large part of the differences between scanners was related to reconstruction kernels. The relatively high noise images corresponded with reconstructions using a kernel with edge enhancement such as the Siemens B70 kernel or the GE lung kernel that are routinely used in chest imaging. Conclusion: Objective measurements on CT images allowed for matching of scan protocols among CT scanners of different manufacturers. Use of routine protocols might introduce a bias in the (automated) image analysis.",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis lung disease in children: correlation between MRI and HRCT scores C. Purpose: High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is known to be a sensitive means of detecting lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF), with a significant radiation exposure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) becomes increasingly important in the assessment of CF lung disease. The aim of this study was to establish the agreement between MRI and HRCT scores in a paediatric population. Methods and Materials: HRCT and T2 and post-contrast T1 MRI images were acquired on the same day from 17 CF patients (median age 12.7 years; range 9.1-20.2 years). Two radiologists with either > 20 (HDLP) or 3 years (CS) of ex-were analysed and compared with the corresponding real scan length. For selected CT scanners, radiation doses achieved during the scanograms were reconstructed using mathematical MIRD phantoms. Results: Depending on the patients\u00b4 age, many scanograms considerably exceed the real scan region, thus unjustifiably raising the radiation exposure of the patient. The radiation doses due to CT scanograms are not neglectible as, e.g. the whole body dose achieved during a thorax scanogram can exceed the whole body dose caused by a conventional chest x-ray examination by a factor of 10. Conclusion: An optimisation of scanogram lengths by defining specific anatomical landmarks for standard CT protocols, the optimisation of scanogram exposure parameters in paediatric CT examinations and their implementation into national and international guidelines seems to be necessary to fulfil the ALARA concept in paediatric CT.

Our aim was to test in-vitro different concentrations of Gd-BOPTA to be potentially used to perform MRA. Methods and Materials: Gd-BOPTA (Multihance, Bracco) was diluted in saline (NaCl 0.9%) to achieve different concentrations (4 mmol/l, 2 mmol/l, 1 mmol/l, 0.67 mmol/l, 0.5 mmol/l). Five mL of these solutions was injected in sterile pipes and was added with 0.5 mL of fresh synovial fluid withdrawn from a 71-year-old male knee.

Pig-tail catheter 4 F was placed in ipsilateral common iliac artery via common femoral artery. Subsequently, spiral CTA of pelvis was performed simultaneously to intraarterial administration at 4 ml/s of 6-8 ml of contrast diluted with saline to 18-24 ml. Results: Excellent contrast enhancement of renal graft arterial tree was observed in all patients. No complications associated with arterial access occurred. Mean creatinine/GRR levels prior to the IA-CTA were 3.30 mg/dl and 27.4 ml/min, respectively. On the 5 th day following the study, mean creatinine/GFR levels amounted to 3.36 mg/dl and 27.8 ml/min, respectively. Renal function deterioration was demonstrated on the 3 rd day after the procedure (creatinine 3.54 ml/dl, GFR 26.8 ml/min); nevertheless, it was not statistically relevant (p < 0.71). Contrast-induced nephropathy occurred in only one patient (5.6%) with transient creatinine elevation by 92%. After detailed vessel analysis graft arterial stenting was performed in 10 patients, which improved renal function. The remaining 8 patients were treated conservatively. Conclusion: Trans-catheter ultra-low-dose-contrast IA-CTA for imaging of renal graft arteries can be an effective method with low-risk of nephrotoxicity, which allows detailed graft arterial tree imaging, especially prior to interventional treatment of arterial-related renal graft insufficiency.",

Conclusion: A 1 molar GBCA concentration leads to a more compact bolus shape with significant higher peak concentrations in the major thoracal vessels compared to a 0.5 molar agent. This might be especially relevant for the acquisition of 4D angiograms and for quantification of tissue perfusion.",

Vogl 1 , M. von Roden 2 , E. Mbalisike 1 , S. Zangos 1 ; 1 Frankfurt a. Main/DE, 2 Forchheim/ DE (t.vogl@em.uni-frankfurt.de) Purpose: To evaluate potential contrast savings and reduction of motion artefacts in C-arm CT acquisitions with a higher rotational speed during interventional procedures. Methods and Materials: 24 patients (mean 56.8 yrs, range 33-83) were treated with transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). Prior to the injection of the embolisation material, a C-arm CT with a new, fast acquisition protocol was performed. A robotic multi-axis C-arm angiographic system (Artis zeego, Siemens-Healthcare, Forchheim/Germany) was used with a rotational speed of up to 100\u00b0/s. In this configuration, a C-arm-CT with a rotational trajectory of 200\u00b0 was acquired in 3s versus 5s in a commercially available C-arm system. Two different injection protocols were applied and evaluated regarding sufficient tumour visualisation and spatial resolution of the vessel tree in the resulting 3D-dataset. Results: Injection protocol 1 (6 ml contrast, 12 ml NaCl, flow rate 3 ml/s, x-ray delay 3s, injection site: common hepatic artery) resulted in 3D images with a very good spatial resolution of the vessel trees but poor visualisation of tumours/metastases. Injection protocol 2 (7 ml contrast, 20 ml NAaCl, x-ray delay 6s) resulted in 3D images with excellent spatial resolution and good visualisation of tumours/ metastases. From prior experience with a standard 5s protocol the corresponding C-arm CT acquisition would have required a contrast load of 8 ml and 8.5 ml, respectively. Thus, the contrast saving of the fast acquisition protocol was 25% and 18%, respectively.",

However, quantification remains challenging because of numerous methodological settings and their limitations. We aimed to provide a laterality index (LIMCA) to better identify abnormal CVR in clinical practice.

Averaged end-tidal CO2 pressure (EtCO2) was used as a physiological regressor for statistical analyses with a general linear model (SPM8). We conducted regions of interest (ROI) measures of %BOLD signal change/mmHg EtCO2 on segmented grey matter of the MCA territories.

The aim of this study is to validate the flow measurements of qMRA (NOVA, VasSol Inc., Chicago) by comparing the obtained velocities with qMRA and Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) in-vivo. To our knowledge, no previous reports have addressed this issue. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively examined consecutive 24 patients (9 women, 15 men; mean age 63 years, range 24-80 years) with stenosis of arteries supplying the brain using qMRA and DUS. Velocities were measured in a total of 209 arterial segments (110 extra-and 99 intracranial). Results: Overall there was a good correlation between velocity measurements with both techniques being statistically significant in all six extracranial and five out of seven intracranial segments. Velocities were 56% higher in extracranial and 45% higher in intracranial segments obtained with DUS comparing to those with qMRA. The reversal of flow direction in the ACA was detected consistently with both methods.",

QMRA represents a robust MRI technique for flow measurements in a reasonable time, which can be integrated in the cerebrovascular MRI work-up, especially when intracranial DUS is technically not feasible. However, further in-vivo and in-vitro studies are needed to assess the need for technical optimisation of this technique. Purpose: Sensitive documentation of ischaemia is needed in clinical TIA. We aimed to compare the sensitivity of DTI, DWI and ASL in the detection of acute ischaemia and further to investigate if chronic ischaemic changes after 8 weeks in the form of gliosis always follow. Methods and Materials: The first 40 consecutive patients included during first 3 months of an MRI-protocol (DWI, DTI and ASL within 72 hours of symptoms) and 8 weeks follow-up protocol (T2 and DWI). Patients were included by stroke consultants. Lesion volumes on DWI, DTI and follow-up T2 were compared. Hyper-or hypoperfusion on ASL was recorded. One senior neuroradiologist assessed the sequences in random order to prevent bias. Results: Fourteen patients had acute ischaemic lesions: 2 in the posterior fossa and 12 in the cerebral hemispheres corresponding to 35% of referred patients. Thirteen of these developed gliosis in the affected area and of these 1 was noted only on DTI and 1 only as post-ischaemic hyper-perfusion on ASL. Mean lesion volume was 1.2 mL. Mean difference between volume on DWI and gliose volume was 0.42 mL =71% and between DTI and gliose volume 0.29 mL=40% and DTI volume were significantly closer (p=0.042). Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate that TIA causes a gliosis lesion consistently, and that the initial lesion as well as the extent of the permanent changes is better described using DTI. ASL seems to be able to contribute to the detection of TIA as this may be sole MRI-sign in some patients increasing detection rates with 5%.",

Patients presenting with a NIH Stroke Scale Score < 5 were subjected to subgroup analysis. TTP perfusion deficit with delays of more than 3 seconds was considered significant for underlying ischaemia. The perfusion parameters were compared to follow-up imaging at 24 to 48 hours. Results: 41 patients met inclusion criteria. 7 patients had identifiable thrombus. The TTP map had the highest sensitivity in detecting the small infarcts (92%), followed by CBV and CBF. Importantly, TTP analysis provided very high negative predictive value (93%). However, there was a relatively lower specificity (64%) and a tendency to overestimate the infarct size. Conclusion: TTP perfusion is highly sensitive in predicting small regions of ischaemia. High negative predictive value is helpful in differentiating stroke from mimics. Purpose: To study the influence of the temporal sampling rate of CTP acquisitions on cerebral perfusion maps with noise-free synthetic data sets created with a digital phantom. Methods and Materials: Noise-free synthetic data sets were created with a digital phantom which consists of a skull derived from a human skull phantom combined with arterial input and venous output functions, white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) time-attenuation curves (TAC) obtained from 5 patients. By manipulating the time tags CTP protocols with a total scan duration of 60s and a temporal sampling rate of 1-, 2-, 3-and 4s were simulated. The 1-s protocol was used as reference standard. The 2-, 3-and 4-s protocols were shifted with 1s to measure the influence of missing peak points of the curve, resulting in 1, 2, 3 extra data sets, respectively. CBF, CBV and MTT maps were calculated using PMA (ASIST-Japan). Mean values of GM and WM of the protocols were compared with the reference protocol.

Mismatch extent was defined as the fraction of CBF perfusion deficit without corresponding CBV abnormality and was determined volumetrically using Osirix V.4.0 imaging software. A logistic regression analysis was performed to predict time from symptom onset of < 4.5 hours. Four mismatch extent categories, CBF perfusion deficit and CBV infarction volume were entered as predictors into the model. Results: Mean time from symptom onset was 187 min\u00b1101 min. Mean mismatch extent was 59.5%\u00b131.1%. After correcting for age and gender, a mismatch extent of \u00b390% was highly predictive for a symptom onset of < 4.5hrs (n=18, OR: 8.70, p=0.03).

Conclusion: A large (\u00b390%) volumetrically determined mismatch in WB-CTP is a predictor for the time from symptom onset in the critical time window.

Purpose: Whole brain CT perfusion (WB-CTP) eliminates the major drawback of restricted brain coverage in standard 2-slice CTP. Our aim was to assess reliability and reproducibility of a newly introduced volumetric assessment method of perfusion deficits in WB-CTP in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods and Materials: 24 consecutive patients underwent 128-row WB-CTP with extended scan coverage of 10.0 cm in the z-axis using adaptive spiral scanning technique. Volumetric analysis of cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TTP), and time to drain (TTD) was performed twice by two experienced readers using dedicated imaging software with at least 2-week intervals between readings. Inter-and intrareader agreement for individual perfusion parameter maps was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. Results: Interreader agreement was highest for TTD (ICC: 0.985), followed by CBF (0.969), MTT (0.949), CBV (0.935), and TTP (0.851). Intrareader agreement was also highest for TTD (ICC: 0.995), followed by MTT (0.979), CBF (0.977), CBV (9.942), and TTP (0.944). The perfusion deficits showed the highest absolute mean volume in the time-related parametric maps and did not differ significantly within this group, while mean CBF perfusion deficit volume was significantly smaller (each with p < 0.01). Conclusion: Volumetric assessment in WB-CTP in acute stroke patients is reliable and reproducible. It therefore might serve for a more accurate assessment of prognosis of stroke outcome and definition of flow-volume mismatch. TTD had the highest agreement and therefore might be a suitable parameter to define tissue at risk.",

Two readers prospectively analysed in consensus DTS images. Each patient underwent CT when a pulmonary non-calcified lesion was identified by DTS, while CT was not performed when a benign pulmonary or extrapulmonary lesion or pseudolesion was identified. Diagnostic imaging costs (including material, staff, and imaging system depreciation) were evaluated during the12-month preceding DTS implementation and during the12-month after DTS implementation. The average imaging cost per patient was calculated by normalising the costs before and after implementation of DTS by the number of indeterminate CXR examinations in each of these periods. Results: In 229/465 patients who underwent DTS after suspicious CXR, DTS showed 193 thoracic lesions and 36 pleural lesions, while in the remaining 236/465 patients lesions were ruled-out as pseudolesions of CXR. In the 12-month preceding DTS implementation, the proportion of patients who presented suspected thoracic lesions and underwent CT was 271/811; after DTS implementation, this proportion became 39/800. The average differential per-patient costs of CXR, DTS, and CT examinations were 15.15, 41.55, and 113.66 euros, respectively. The perpatient change in diagnostic imaging costs before vs after DTS implementation was -24.79 euros.

Fourier decomposition MRI (FD-MRI) has been introduced as a method to assess regional lung perfusion without contrast agents. This study evaluates FD-MRI for preoperative assessment of lung perfusion in NSCLC patients with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) as standard of reference. Methods and Materials: 15 patients with NSCLC were examined at 1.5 T. Timeresolved images of the lungs were acquired in coronal and sagittal plane using a 2D-bSSFP sequence. Fourier decomposition was used to detect and separate periodic changes of lung proton density caused by respiratory and cardiac cycles. Perfusion-weighted images were calculated by pixel-wise integration of the cardiac spectral line. FD and DCE data were analysed visually for perfusion defects. Perfusion proportions of pulmonary lobes were calculated quantitatively by regions-of-interest analyses. Results: FD-MRI provided diagnostic quality in 14 cases, but failed in one patient. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FD-MRI for visual detection of perfusion defects were 78%, 92%, and 90%. Quantitative evaluation of perfusion proportions provided good linear correlation between FD-MRI and DCE-MRI for both upper lobes and both entire lungs (r=0.70-0.85). Accuracy of FD-MRI in the lower lobes (r=0.02-0.03) and the middle lobe (r=0.32) was compromised by artefacts from cardiac pulsation. Conclusion: FD-MRI is useful to detect regional lung perfusion defects in NSCLC patients before surgery. For perfusion quantification, FD-MRI is sufficiently accurate in both upper lobes and for bilateral comparison, but, in its present form, inaccurate in the middle lobe and both lower lobes. ",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate a group of elderly-nonsmoker-healthy patients in comparison with young subjects, by using ultrasound examination. Methods and Materials: 100 elderly subjects (> 70years-mean age: 79.4\u00b16.9) and 50 young subjects (< 55years-mean age: 32.5\u00b112.1) were submitted to lung ultrasound examination. We analysed the anterior, lateral and posterior surface of each lung to evaluate the presence/absence of A-lines and B-lines. Fisher test was chosen to compare data obtained in the two groups. Results: Absence of A-lines was found in 94/100-94.0% of elderly versus 2/50-4.0% of young subjects (p < 0.0001). Presence of B-lines was detected in 37/100-37.0% of elderly, with a higher prevalence in posterior lung fields; the number of B-lines was\u00b23 per field (pf) in 27/37-73.0%, > 3pf in 2/37-5.4%; both \u00b23 and > 3pf-depending on the evaluated field in 8/37-21.6%. By contrast, 5/50-10.0% young subjects showed B-lines (\u00b23pf in all of cases)-p=0.0004.",

Interventional-radiological management was as follows: PTC/biliary-drainage in case of biliary-fistulas (bile in surgical drainage, normal bilirubin levels, undilated biliary ducts at US) under US/fluoroscopic-guidance (right approach, puncturing along the course of the sixth-segment portal branch with 21G Chiba-needle, or left approach if aerobilia/ adequate volume of left hepatic lobe); embolisation (microcoils/PVA-particles) or covered-stenting (Viabahn-Gore) in case of bleedings of gastroduodenal/splenic arteries; percutaneous drainage (US/CT-guidance) of liquid/infected collections. Pancreatic-islet-intraportal-autotransplantation was performed in case of totalpancreatectomy to prevent diabetes. Results: Patients were classified as follows: 524/1285 (40%) class-0, 210/1285 (16%) class-1, 361/1285 (28%) class-2, 72/1285 (6%) class-3a, 55/1285 (4%) class-3b, 24/1285 (2%) class-4, 39/1285 (3%) class-5. 72/1285 (class-3a) and were successfully treated as follows: 30/72 PTC/biliary-drainages, 27/72 liquid/infected collection percutaneous-drainages, 9/72 bleedings (7 embolisations, 2 coveredstenting), 6/72 endoscopic-procedures. 25/1285 underwent pancreatic-isletintraportal-autotransplantation. One bleeding/1 biliary-fistula needed 2 treatments. Conclusion: In experienced centres of pancreatic surgery, complication rate can be reduced. Complications can be, however, successfully diagnosed, managed and prevented by interventional-radiological procedures, limiting their clinical relevance and avoiding a high-risk surgical re-treatment. Purpose: To evaluate technical feasibility and clinical efficacy of retrievable covered stents in treating post-surgical biliary leakage. Methods and Materials: From April 2008 to date, 16 patients (9 males, 7 females; mean age 52 years, range 18-83 years) were retrospectively studied. Patients underwent placement of retrievable covered stents for treat post-surgical bile leaks. In 12 cases the procedure was performed by interventional radiologist using percutaneous trans hepatic access and in 4 cases by means of hybrid procedure (PTBD + ERCP) with both interventional radiologist and endoscopist. The leaks involved cystic duct stump (n = 6), common bile duct anastomosis (n = 6), left extra hepatic duct (n = 1), right extra hepatic duct (n =2) and biliary confluence (n = 1). Results: Technical success with correct stent releasing was achieved in 15 cases; 1 case required post-dilatation ballooning. Immediate clinical and lab test improvements were observed in all patients. Post-operative imaging proved leak resolution in all cases. No early complications were observed. In 1 case late stent migration was reported 21 days after the procedure. Twelve stents were removed without complication after a mean time of 59 days, with complete leak resolution. One stent",

Methods and Materials: A total of 77 consecutive pathologically proven and clinically assessed stage I NSCLC patients (41 males, 36 females; mean age: 71 years) underwent thin-section CE-CT, non-CE-MR angiography and CE-MR angiography, and surgical treatment. The capability for anomaly assessment of the three methods was independently evaluated by two reviewers using a 5-point visual scoring systems, and final assessment for each patient was made by consensus of the two readers. Interobserver agreements for pulmonary arterial and venous assessment were evaluated with the kappa statistic. Assessment of variations in overall pulmonary vasculature by the three methods was compared by means of receiver operating characteristic analyses on a per-patient basis. Finally, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detection of anomalies were directly compared among the three methods by means of McNemar's test. Results: Interobserver agreements for pulmonary artery and vein assessment were substantial or almost perfect (0.72\u00b2\u03ba\u00b20.86). For pulmonary arterial and venous variation assessment, non-CE-MR angiography, 4D CE-MR angiography and thinsection CE-CT showed no significant differences (p> 0.05) in terms of area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Conclusion: Pulmonary vascular assessment of NSCLC patients before surgical resection by non-CE-MR angiography can be considered equal to that by 4D CE-MR angiography and thin-section CE-CT. ",

Wacker; Hannover/DE (rodt.thomas@mh-hannover.de) Purpose: To report on micro-CT and micro-PET imaging of spontaneously developing lung tumour in SPC-raf and SPC-myc transgenic mice. Technical considerations regarding periprocedural management and imaging technique are addressed; tumour quantification techniques are presented. Dosage measurements are reported and potential adverse effects discussed. Methods and Materials: 4 wild-type control, 25 SPC-raf and 7 SPC-myc transgenic mice were examined in vivo using micro-CT (n=180) and 18 F-FDG micro-PET (n=14). Specific periprocedural management was established. Different respiratory gated and ungated micro-CT protocols were compared. A quantification routine for tumour load and growth was validated and examined in a follow-up study. 18 F-FDG micro-PET of orthotopic lung tumour was obtained; quantification was performed on lesion and lung region basis. Findings were correlated to histology. Thermoluminescence dosemeter measurements and dosage calculations for micro-CT and micro-PET were performed. Results: No procedure-related deaths occurred for up to 547 days of follow-up. Respiratory gated micro-CT protocols yielded better image quality compared with ungated protocols. Intra-and inter-observer variability of the quantification routine were 5.1 and 6.5%, respectively. Tumour quantification showed significant difference (p=0.043) between SPC-raf transgenic and control animals in follow-up. Longitudinal tumour development correlated to cross-sectional histological data from literature. Micro-PET yielded a tumour-to-non-tumour ratio of 2.47 in SPC-myc transgenic animals. Micro-CT dosage ranged from 174 to 277 mGy. The estimated dosage calculated for micro-PET was 140 mGy. Conclusion: Micro-CT and 18 F-FDG micro-PET provide quantitative data on morphology and metabolism in orthotopic lung tumour. The techniques can safely be applied in animal model phenotyping and therapeutic studies.",

Thus, we introduced foam sclerotherapy to reduce the dose and compared the safety and efficacy of BRTO using liquid and foam sclerosants. Methods and Materials: Forty-three patients with gastric varices were performed BRTO since October '01. Of these, three patients were excluded because simultaneous TACE or PSE was performed. Twenty patients using liquid ethanolamine oleate with iodine contrast (EOI) before March '05 and twenty patients using polidocanol foam (POF) after May '05 were included in this study. The success rates, side effects and complication rates were compared among the two groups. Results: Complete stasis of the gastric varices was obtained in all patients of both groups. Abdominal symptoms during BRTO were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in EOI (55%) than POF (15%). Postprocedure fever (> 38.0) was also significantly (p < 0.01) higher in EOI (55%) than in POF (0%). In both groups total bilirubin increased and platelet counts decreased significantly (p < 0.01).

Eleven patients were operated on for femoral neck fracture. Tomosynthesis detected ten of these, and the eleventh patient was operated on without diagnostic confirmation from any imaging modality. One patient had been operated with dynamic hip screw for intertrochanteric fracture. The remaining trochanteric fractures were incomplete and were treated conservatively. There were no false-positive tomosynthesis diagnoses reported. There were no significant falsenegative tomosynthesis diagnoses. The distinction between incomplete/complete trochanteric fractures and greater trochanteric avulsions is sometimes difficult. Purpose: Advanced core decompression (ACD) is in clinical evaluation for patients with avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip. In opposition to standard core decompression, ACD uses an expandable reamer allowing optimal debridement of necrosis after drilling a core to the femoral head. The bone defect is filled with a bone graft substitute. We aimed to constitute the therapeutic success of ACD based on MRI. Methods and Materials: Twenty patients (17 males, 3 females, mean age 49.9 years) underwent 3 T MRI of the hip prior to, 30 days and 0.5 -2 years after ACD. The protocol included TIRM, PD/T2w TSE, high-resolution T1w, DESS and T1w VIBE sequences. Sequences were evaluated regarding delineation of necrosis, bone, graft and transformation zone in between. The volume of necrosis was measured before and after ACD. Results: AVN prior to ACD as well as the defect filled with the graft after ACD and the residual necrosis could be imaged with reproducible high quality at 3 T. T1w and PDw sequences provided best contrast to measure the volume of necrosis. Each patient showed a reduction of necrosis after ACD (17.7 % to 90.8 %, mean 43.0, SD 24.2). The granulation zone around the graft could especially be visualised by T2w TIRM and PDw sequences. The arrangement of different layers correlated with histological findings. Conclusion: Structural changes and reduction of necrosis after ACD can be monitored by MRI. ACD does significantly reduce the volume of necrosis in AVN of the hip.",

In the second study-part, 41 consecutive patients with unilateral (n=32) or bilateral (n=9) hipprosthesis were included. Datasets using filtered back projection (FBP), IFS and a previously published MAR algorithm using linear-interpolation were reconstructed. Two readers evaluated axial, coronal and sagittal CT image reformations for overall image quality and evaluated image quality of pelvic organ depiction; CT numbers in the urinary bladder, gluteal muscle and subcutaneous fat were measured. Results: Ex-vivo experiments revealed the best image quality for IFS. Measurements of CT numbers of the inlays were more accurate for IFS. In patients, we found a significant improvement in overall image quality for all reformations (P < 0.001) and a significantly increased image quality of pelvic organs (P < 0.001) for the IFS algorithm. CT numbers of the bladder (P < 0.001) and muscle (P=0.043) were significantly less variable for IFS as compared with images reconstructed with FBP and the linear interpolation MAR algorithm, whereas we found no significant difference for fat (P=0.159).",

Caruso, C.N. De Cecco, D. Bellini, A. Laghi; Latina/IT (fabrizio.vecchietti@gmail.com) Purpose: To compare performances of different experienced readers using a primary 3D flythrough approach with and without the use of a CAD analysis. Methods and Materials: Three readers evaluated 50 patients with 100 endoscopically proved polyps (ranging from 3 mm to 40 mm) and different colonic preparations (18 fluid tagging, 32 full cathartic preparation). Dataset analyses were performed on a GE ADW 4.6 workstation equipped with VCAR colon software. Per-polyp sensitivity, inter-reader agreement, mean reporting time and false positive were evaluated for each approach. Results: Less experienced readers increased per-polyp sensitivity, respectively, from 75% and 64% for 3D analysis to 86% and 74% for primary 3D+CAD analysis with a significant difference (p=0.001 and p=0.04) while no significant differences were found for the expert reader (p=0.06). Less experienced readers were faster when assisted by CAD but no significant differences were found on mean reading time for all readers (p= 0.5/0.07/0.1). Mean false-positive findings for CAD standalone analysis were 12 (+-13). All readers decrease false positive when assisted by CAD especially less experienced ones. Inter-reader agreement was higher among all readers when assisted by CAD ( Methods and Materials: Seventy-five consecutive patients were prospectively randomised into two groups. Both groups followed a low residue diet for two days before the examination. Both preparations were based on fluid tagging, using a iodinate contrast medium (gastromiro). Group 1 received 180 ml of fluid tagging agent the day before the study. Group 2 received 60 ml of fluid tagging agent the day of the exam and 500 ml of a laxative agent (Lovol-esse) the day before the study. Patient acceptance was evaluated using a visual assessment scale. Quality of bowel preparation was evaluated using quantitative (tagged fluid density and number of untagged residue per segment) and qualitative (homogeneity per segment on a 4 point scale) scores. Results: Bowel preparation was complete in all patients. No statistical significant differences for tagged fluid density, number of residue and tagging homogeneity between the two groups were founded. A significant higher patient acceptance was founded in group 2 (P=0.02).",

Patients were randomised to receive either a bolus of 7.5 \u03bcg/kg alfentanil (n=45) or placebo (n=45). The primary outcome was the difference in maximum pain during colonic insufflation on an 11-point numeric rating scale (one-sided t test). We defined a clinically relevant effect as a maximum pain reduction of at least 1.3 points. Secondary outcomes included total pain and burden of CT colonography (5-point scale), most burdensome aspect, side effects and recovery time measured by the Aldrete score. Results: Maximum pain scores during insufflation were lower with alfentanil as compared with placebo, 5.3 versus 3.0 (p < 0.001). Total CT colonography pain and burden were also significantly lower with alfentanil (2.0 vs. 1.6 and 2.1 vs. 1.7, respectively). With alfentanil fewer patients rated the insufflation as most burdensome aspect (56.1% vs. 18.6%; p=0.001). No clinically relevant desaturations occurred. Episodes with desaturations < 90% SpO2 and dizziness were more common with alfentanil (4.4% vs. 37.8%; p < 0.001 and 8.1% vs. 44.4%; p < 0.001).

Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of contrast material-enhanced computed tomographic colonography (CTC) for follow-up after curative surgery for colorectal cancer without evidence of disease recurrence. Methods and Materials: 86 patients underwent CTC and colonoscopy (within 4 months) after colorectal cancer surgery. Patients with the suspicion of disease recurrence underwent pathologic confirmation. Patients performed bowel cleansing and faecal tagging; bowel distention was achieved using CO2. Both prone and supine scans, one after intravenous contrast material administration during the portal phase, were obtained using a 64-detector CT (\"Brilliance\" Philips with iDose). Images were reconstructed with a section thickness of 0.75 mm, transferred to a workstation and interpreted by one radiologist with experience reading several hundred CTC cases. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of CTC for anastomotic and non-anastomotic colonic lesions (metachronous or flat lesions and polips) were determined and compared to endoscopy. Results: CTC detected all 2 anastomotic recurrences, all 3 metachronous lesions (sensitivity and specificity=100%) and a perianastomotic recurrence. In 13 patients CTC depicted 16/17 polips > 5 mm (sensitivity=94.1%, specificity=100%, VPP=100%, VPN=98.6%, accuracy= 98.8%) and in 1 patient detected 1 of 3 flat lesions (sensitivity=33.3%, specificity=100%).

Low-dose parameters were based on our phantom study with using vendor-specific automatic tube current modulation known as noise index. Both sets of scans were reconstructed with ASIR and MBIR. Objective and subjective image qualities were assessed as well as diagnostic accuracies for significant lesions (e.g. polyps, cancer, etc). Effective doses for each scans were recorded. Results: Objective image analysis supports significant noise reduction and superior contrast-to-noise ratio with low-dose scans using MBIR technique (p < 0.05) despite being acquired at lower doses. Subjective image parameters were equivalent for LD MBIR and SD ASIR for both colonic and extra-colonic findings. Diagnostic accuracies for polyp detection and other significant lesions were comparable. Dose recorded were substantially lower for MBIR (range 45-75% reduction compared with ASIR) with mean average being 4.2 mSv in our population group. Conclusion: MBIR shows superior reduction in noise whilst maintaining image quality and most importantly substantial dose reduction can be achieved.

Using a variance components model it was shown that the difference between true and RECIST-based volume is statistically significant (p < 0.001) indicating a substantial constant bias. Purpose: Tumour treatment by retargeted truncated protein derivatives of the human tissue factor (tTF) results in tumour vessel infarction, necrosis and subsequent tumour growth retardation and regression. A novel method of gadofosvesetenhanced MRI, that enables the visualisation of the response to this treatment in real-time, is introduced. Methods and Materials: Dynamic gadofosveset-enhanced MRI (3 T) was performed in eight tumour-bearing (U87) nude mice. In the course of an ultrafast T1-weighted gradient echo sequence, a gadolinium-based blood pool contrast agent (gadofosveset trisodium) was injected intravenously via a tail vein catheter. After the maximum contrast intensity inside the tumour was obtained, 150 \u00b5l of tTF-NGR (a retargeted tTF derivative which binds to CD13-overexpressing tumour endothelial cells) were injected intravenously via a second tail vein catheter (n = 4; saline solution as control: n = 4), and the contrast behaviour of the tumour was monitored by region of interest (ROI) analysis. Results: Following the injection of tTF-NGR (approx. 500 sec. after the beginning of the sequence), the contrast intensity inside the tumours of the treated mice decreased more instantly and more strongly than in the tumours of the control mice (AUC 1121.3 \u00b1 0.65 vs. 1164.4 \u00b1 0.52 AU). Conclusion: Gadofosveset-enhanced MRI allows for the visualisation of the therapeutic response of tumours to anti-vascular treatment in real-time. Considering the intended clinical application of tTF-NGR, this method might be a simple and quick surrogate parameter for the monitoring of the therapeutic response to vascular disrupting agents in humans. Purpose: The specific growth pattern of pleural mesothelioma along the pleural surface makes therapy monitoring using common measurement criteria, such as RECIST 1.0, difficult. Therefore, Byrne et al. developed modified RECIST criteria for pleural mesothelioma. In this study we evaluated the accordance between experienced and less experienced readers for RECIST 1.0, RECIST 1.1, mRE-CIST, and WHO. Methods and Materials: A total of 43 baseline and follow-up-CT scans from 15 patients from a clinical multi-centre pleural mesothelioma trial were retrospectively evaluated by different experienced radiologist (about 1 year and more than 10 years), who selected target lesions independently according to mRECIST, RECIST 1.0, RECIST 1.1 and WHO criteria. CT scans were then re-measured after an interval of greater than one month. The inter-and intra-reader variability using the different response criteria was analysed. Results: Both, the intra-reader-and inter-reader variability were best when using mRECIST (95 % limits of agreement of -28.4/ 12.9 and of -32.1/ 20.7) compared 'with RECIST 1.0, RECIST 1.1 and WHO. Further, regarding the objective response (PR = partial response, SD=stable disease and PD = progressive disease), mRE-CIST showed the most reliable intra-observer outcome with only one differently classified examination and the most reliable inter-observer outcome with four differently classified examinations. Conclusion: Our results suggest that mRECIST is most reliable for treatment response evaluation of pleural mesothelioma between experienced and less experienced readers compared with RECIST 1.0, RECIST 1.1 and WHO. To confirm these findings, the inclusion of further readers and more patient data is warranted.",

Results: The analysis of baseline and subsequent radiology reports revealed that radiologists reported measurements in 90% of cases, saved measurements in 20% of baseline and 50% of follow-up studies, and correlated measurements between exams in only 40%. The application of ViSion enabled a means to record tumour measurements in 100% of cases by providing a visual record of where target lesions were previously measured, facilitating the linking of image findings between examinations and displaying the findings in disease timelines.",

To identify the potential of breast MRI vs. standard prognostic factors to predict tumour recurrence after successful treatment of primary breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Consecutive patients receiving staging MRI and subsequent guideline-approved therapy of primary breast cancer at our academic breast centre were investigated. Standard prognostic factors including TNM staging, tumour typing, tumour grading, progesterone/estrogen receptors, HER2NEU score and associated DCIS component were assessed. Follow-up was performed (endpoint: \"tumour-recurrence\" after complete remission). For analysis of breast-MRI a dedicated CAD software was used (computer-aided analysis). It enables semi-automatic analysis of enhancement characteristics of the whole tumour (3D analysis of early vs. delayed phase) and the \"hot-spot\" (i.e. voxel with highest washin/wash-out ratio). Potential of breast MRI characteristics vs. standard prognostic factors to stratify the endpoint separately and in combination was investigated using logistic regression. To identify significant and independent predictors, backward feature selection was applied (p entry /removal: < 0.05 /> 0.01). Results: 223 patients were included (endpoint: n=13/5.8%, loss-to follow-up: n=7/3.1%). If tested separately, logistic regression identified moderate potential for breast MRI (AUCMRI=0.79, p=0.001) and standard prognostic factors (AUC-standard=0.71; p=0.01) to stratify the endpoint. If breast MRI characteristics and standard prognostic factors were combined, predictive performance could be increased considerably (AUCcombined=0.90, p < 0.001, sensitivity=84.6%, specificity=87.3%). Feature selection identified one standard prognostic factor (M-Stage) and four breast MRI characteristics (hot-spot: Wash-in, washout-ratio; 3D-analysis: tumour voxels showing wash-out plus weak wash-in, tumour voxels showing plateau and weak wash-in) as the most significant and independent predictors of tumour recurrence. Purpose: To estimate the influence of breast density on diagnostic performance of DBT added to DM (DM+DBT), focusing on recall rate reduction. Methods and Materials: Seventy-five women were recalled for 77 findings on DM screening examination and further investigated according to usual protocols (additional DM views, ultrasonography, and/or core needle biopsy). The final conventional assessment was: 7 cancers (4 invasive ductal carcinoma, 2 invasive lobular carcinomas) and 68 negative/benign cases. Before this conventional work-up, 1-or 2-view DBT was obtained (Giotto, IMS, Italy) for an off-line further evaluation. Two independent readers, blinded to final conventional assessment, retrospectively assigned a BI-RADS score to each lesion on both DM only and DM+DBT. Breast density was scored according to ACR categories from 1 to 4. \u03c7 2 test was used. Results: None of the 7 cancers was missed on DM+DBT by each of the two readers; of 14 readings, 7 (50%) had an increased BI-RADS score. Of 136 readings of 68 benign/negative cases, density was ACR1 in 24 (18%), ACR2 in 60 (44%), ACR3 in 42 (31%) and ACR-4 in 10 (7%); the BI-RADS score was increased in 3 (2%), unchanged in 61 (45%) and decreased in 72 (53%). BI-RADS was decreased for 11/24 (46%) ACR1, 34/60 (53%) ACR2, 25/42 (59%) and 4/10 (40%) ACR4 (p= 0.595). Conclusion: Breast density does not influence the capability of DBT, as added to DM, to decrease the BI-RADS score of negative/benign cases recalled for further assessment at screening DM.",

Methods and Materials: 100 women with abnormal screening mammograms,187 findings, and definite imaging or histopathological diagnosis were included. The screening mammography interpretation consisted of direct comparison of the tomosynthesis (DBT) examination with full field digital mammography (FFDM) images. The study radiologists subjectively rated the equivalence of the image quality of both the DBT and the FFDM examinations with no use of additional mammography, magnification views or comparison mammography. The next step was categorising the findings in both FFDM and DBT separately according to BIRADS classification and the statistical analysis evaluated the p values of DBT and FFDM as well as their sensitivities. Results: All findings categorised as BIRADS 3 according to mammography showed reduction in number,particularly for masses, when examined with tomosynthesis. The image quality of tomosynthesis was subjectively rated as equivalent (53.5%) or superior (43.3%) to digital mammography in 96.8% of the total of findings; the test was highly significant (p < 0.001).

Purpose: To compare discordant screen-detected cancers in FFDM (\"2D-mode\") versus 2D plus tomosynthesis (2D+3D or \"combo-mode\") in a population-based screening program. Methods and Materials: Oslo Tomosynthesis Screening Trial (OTST), a large prospective study comparing FFDM with 2D plus tomosynthesis in breast cancer screening, is part of the Norwegian Screening Program. Women 50-69 are invited biannually to mammography using independent double reading. The two main arms of OTST have independent double reading. One 2D arm is modified with CAD and one combo-arm with synthetic 2D. The four arms are read by independent radiologists. From 22.11.2010 to 31.12.2011, 121 screen-detected cancers were found. Results: Cancers detected: Arm A (conventional FFDM) 77, arm B (2D+CAD) 77, arm C (2D+tomo) 101, and arm D (synthetic 2D+tomo) 94. Merging arm A and B (\"2D-mode\") and C+D (\"combo-mode\"), 90 cancers were detected by \"2D-mode\" and 119 by \"combo-mode\" (32.2% relative increase). Discordant rate (screendetected cancer with TP score by only one reader) was 28.9% (26/90) for \"2D-mode\" and 36.1% (43/119) for \"combo-mode\". For cancers manifesting as spiculated mass or distortion (n=63) the discordant rate was 31.0% (13/42) for \"2D-mode\" and 30.6% (19/62) for \"combo-mode\". For cancers with microcalcifications the values were 25.7% (9/35) and 39.5% (17/43), respectively. Conclusion: Combined FFDM and tomosynthesis showed a 32% relative increase in cancer detection as compared with FFDM. Discordant cancer rate was approximately the same or higher for \"combo-mode\" as compared with \"2D-mode\". Independent double reading should be the standard of care when tomosynthesis is implemented into mammography screening.

Purpose: To assess the added value of functional sequences, using diffusionweighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient value, to conventional MRI imaging examination in the differential diagnosis from benign and malignant focal liver lesions. Methods and Materials: A total of 53 patients with known focal liver lesions including 36 benign (25 angiomas, 8 FNH, 2 abscesses) and 18 malignant (9 metastases, 7 HCCs, 2 cholangiocarcinomas) underwent 1.5-T MRI examination (Achieva, Philips). The study was performed with a phased array multi-coil using a conventional protocol that included also diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with different b-values. The ROIs were manually drawn on focal liver lesions and on surrounding normal hepatic parenchyma in ADC maps, and statistical analysis of ADC mean values was performed. Results: Lesions were proved either by follow-up (benign lesions) or biopsy (malignant lesions).Following mean ADC values were obtained for different types of benign lesions: angiomas (1794.27\u00b1125, 2x10-3 mm2/sec), FNH (1486.74\u00b1156, 8x10-3 mm2/sec), abscesses (1133\u00b1145, 5x10-3 mm2/sec) while in the neoplastic lesions were: metastases (1025, 6\u00b193x10-3 mm2/sec), HCCs (887, 6\u00b171, 10x10-3 mm2/sec) and cholangiocarcinomas (1285\u00b125x10-3 mm2/sec). In normal hepatic parenchyma, mean perfusion values were (1158, 4\u00b1158, 7x10-3 mm2/sec). A statistical higher values (p < 0.001) were obtained in diffusion parameters among benign than those of malignant lesions (1563\u00b1142, 4 vs 1066\u00b1138, 3x10-3 mm2/sec). Conclusion: Diffusion-weighted images offer useful quantitative information (by evaluation of ADC maps) that differs significantly in solid and malignant liver lesions, due to tumour different vascularity and cellularity. Purpose: To identify the best MR sequences for pancreatic adenocarcinoma conspicuity and determine whether MR signal and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values correlate with pathological findings. Methods and Materials: 25 consecutive patients with pathologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent MRI (1.5 or 3 T) before surgical resection were included. Fat-suppressed (FS) T1-weighted gradient-echo (GRE), FS T2-weighted fast-recovery fast spin echo, 3D FS dynamic T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced GRE during arterial, portal and delayed phases and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with b values of 0 and 600 or 800 sec/mm2 were obtained. Two observers reviewed MR sequences for size, signal characteristics and lesion conspicuity using a four-point rating scale. ADC of tumours were calculated. Histological characteristics (differentiation, fibrosis, necrosis) were correlated with MRI features. Results: 95% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas were hypointense on 3D FS T1 GRE arterial phase, which was the best sequence for tumour conspicuity, followed by portal phase. DWI was not useful for delineating 26% of tumours. Maximum diameter at pathological examination ranged from 18 to 60 mm (mean 33 mm). It was best correlated with MR tumour size on DWI. No correlation was found between ADC (mean value : 1.76x10-3 mm2/sec) and differentiation, fibrosis or necrosis. All homogeneous hyperintense lesions on delayed phase (23% of tumours) were predominantly fibrous tumours. Conclusion: 3D FS T1 GRE arterial phase sequence is superior to DWI for pancreatic adenocarcinoma conspicuity but it underestimates the size of the tumour. DWI is the best sequence for size evaluation when the tumour is correctly delineated.",

We investigated whether this assumption is valid. Methods and Materials: Included were forty-five patients with 73 focal liver lesions (54 malignant and 19 benign) detected on a 1.5 T system (cysts and haemangiomas were excluded from analysis). DW examination was performed using a single-shot Echoplanar sequence with b values of 50, 500 and 800 sec/mm 2 , leading to the generation of (a) the ADC-map, using a 3-point regression analysis and (b) the exponential ADC-map (E-ADC-map), using the b800/b50 images ratio, which provides a diffusion-weighted image with complete eradication of T2-relaxation time effects. By performing an analysis of differential signal patterns, two experienced radiologists in consensus estimated the prevalence of the T2-STE when combining DW images with the ADC-map or E-ADC-map. Purpose: To develop a novel spectral reconstruction algorithm for digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) that results in reduced artifacts and improved image quality. Methods and Materials: Current reconstruction algorithms assume that the xray source emits a mono-energetic x-ray beam, resulting in artifacts and possibly sub-optimal image quality. To avoid this, a mathematical model of DBT acquisition that includes the spectral nature of the x-ray source was developed, resulting in a large scale non-linear inversion problem which we solve using an iterative, gradient descent method. The resulting algorithm was tested using breast phantoms with lesions resembling masses and calcifications. The breast phantoms were imaged with a clinical DBT system using the automatic exposure control system. The resulting spectral reconstructions were compared to the system's filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction, which assumes a mono-energetic x-ray source.",

The microcalcifications also resulted in improved signal difference and without artifacts seen in the FBP reconstructions. Subjective comparison of images of heterogeneous breast phantoms showed an overall improvement in image quality, substantial reduction of artifacts, and lower noise. Conclusion: Spectral reconstruction can improve image quality and reduce artifacts in DBT images. This new algorithm also allows for investigation of novel acquisition techniques that could result in further improvements in DBT imaging.

To further improve image quality and explore possible alternatives to commonly applied iodine-based contrast agents, the use of microbubble-based ultrasound contrast agents as an x-ray scattering dark-field contrast medium was investigated. Methods and Materials: Using the first pre-clinical phase-contrast and dark-field CT scanner with polychromatic x-ray source and grating interferometer installed on a rotating gantry, absorption, phase-contrast and dark-field images of microbubblebased contrast-agent samples were acquired in-vitro. For quantitative comparison, the contrast-to-noise ratio relative to a reference was calculated for varying detector resolutions (29-928 micrometer) in absorption and dark-field images. Results: It was possible to generate an improved contrast-to-noise ratio in the darkfield image compared to the absorption-based image (6.88 versus 1.41, pixel size 29 micrometer) by exploiting the x-ray scattering through microbubbles. With larger pixel sizes (928 micrometer), the relative contrast gain increased to 78.82 for dark field, whereas, with 1.06, it remained in the same order of magnitude for absorption.",

Images were displayed under standard clinical conditions: first on two 5 megapixel medical grade monitors calibrated to the DICOM GSDF standard, then on a 6 megapixel colour monitor, displaying the images in green-scale. Greenscale was chosen as this wavelength matches a peak in human visual response. Reading was performed with the Sara 2 software which displays each CDMAM cell under random rotation, reducing reader memorization. Readers performed a 4-alternative forced choice task; five readers scored all images. Results: Threshold gold thickness (TGT) increased as beam quality and thickness increased, indicating a reduction in object detectability with increasing object thickness. Results obtained for the grey-scale display had a higher TGT compared to green-scale results; TGT values obtained with green-scale display were between 7% and 31% lower than grey-scale display TGT. P values for the different diameters obtained from Wilcoxon matched pairs tests ranged from < 0.01 to 0.68 for 2 cm and < 0.01 to 0.44 for 7 cm.

To measure VBD in a conventional non-energy resolved mammogram, assumptions have to be made on the breast thickness. Spectral imaging, on the other hand, enables simultaneous measurement of breast thickness and glandularity by employing the spectral difference in x-ray attenuation between adipose and fibro-glandular tissue. Spectral mammograms were acquired in a single exposure using a photon-counting mammography system. The VBD was measured by material decomposition based on calibration to tissue-equivalent material. For reference, VBD was measured with a conventional non-spectral method in a similar group of patients. Results: Spectral mammograms of 75 patients, aged 50-69 years, were examined. The correlation in VBD between contralateral breasts was r=0.97. 246 patients were examined with conventional methods, which returned a correlation between contralateral breasts of r=0.92. The VBD distribution was similar in the two groups as measured with the two different methods. Conclusion: Spectral imaging provides an efficient measure of VBD. The VBD distributions over the group of patients were comparable in the spectral and nonspectral measurements, but the correlation between contralateral breasts was tighter using spectral imaging, which indicates higher consistency. Purpose: The feasibility of monochromatic dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) using multilayer reflector for precise measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) was examined. Methods and Materials: A multilayer mirror was fabricated to select an x-ray peak with an energy of 40 keV and 59.3 keV generated from an x-ray tube with a tungsten target. Experimental set-up of monochromatic DEXA was installed by dual-energy of monochromatic x-rays source and CZT detector. The performance of the system was evaluated using a DEXA phantom, spectrometer and radiation dosimeter. We compared the image quality and the attenuation reduction characteristics of the phantom to determine precision of BMD on conventional polychromatic and monochromatic DEXA. Purpose: High vessel attenuation and a high contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratio are prerequisites for highly diagnostic abdominal CT angiography (CTA) examinations. We compared image-quality of standard 120 keV polyenergetic images (PEIs) with calculated low-keV monoenergetic images (MEIs) in dual-energy CTA studies of the abdomen. Methods and Materials: Datasets of fifty patients (42 men, 71 \u00b1 10 years) who underwent abdominal dual-energy CTA were retrospectively evaluated. The 80-and 140-keV dual-energy image data was used to calculate MEIs in 10-keV intervals from 120 keV to 40 keV. Vessel attenuation and image noise were measured in three regions-of-interest (infrarenal aorta, external iliac artery and superior mesenteric artery) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CNR were subsequently calculated. Differences between measurements in MEIs and PEIs were evaluated using the Student's t-test. Results: SNR and CNR of 70-keV MEIs were highest compared to MEIs at other low-keV levels. When comparing MEIs at 70 keV to PEIs, vessel attenuation and image noise were significantly higher in MEIs in all three regions-of-interest (+14%, +13%, +14%; p < 0.05 and +12%, +6%, +9%; all p < 0.05). SNR was slightly increased in 70-keV MEIs (+4%, +7%, +6%; p < 0.05). CNR was also significantly higher in MEIs when compared to PEIs (+18%, +16% and +18%; p < 0.05). Purpose: It was shown in mice the exposure to a high fat (HF) diet during early development increased the susceptibility to high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and decreased markers of hepatic mitochondrial function. We aim to investigate whether early exposure to a HF diet also increases the susceptibility to cardiac fat storage and diminishes cardiac mitochondrial function and ejection fraction. Methods and Materials: Male and female C57BL6 mice were fed a HF diet (45% kcal fat) or standard chow diet (9% kcal fat (LF)), starting at least 6 weeks before conception and continuing during gestation and lactation. From weaning onwards, all offspring were fed the HF diet, generating two groups: HF/HF and LF/ HF. Cardiac function and myocardial fat content were measured in male offspring at 15 weeks of age (n=26) using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy on a 7T MR System (Bruker Biospin GmbH). Cardiac mitochondrial respiration was determined in parallel groups (n=11), using high resolution respirometry (OROBOROS Instruments). Results: At 15 weeks of age, the HF/HF group showed significantly higher cardiac lipid content (p=0.02) compared to the LF/HF group. No significant differences in cardiac mitochondrial function and ejection fraction were detected. Conclusion: Mice exposed to HF feeding during early development were more susceptible for high-fat diet-induced cardiac lipid accumulation. This was not (yet) accompanied by decreased mitochondrial function and/or decreased ejection fraction.",

LGE was significantly smaller in follow-up compared to the first examination (p=0.023). In multivariate regression analysis, RV oedema was the only parameter that was associated with a significant improvement of RV-EF. Conclusion: The significant decrease of LGE in the follow-up examination implies that the area of hyperenhancement might represent necrosis. We furthermore conclude that the extend of RV scar is too small to permanently impair RV-EF function in the majority of patients in follow-up. Purpose: The factors governing periprocedural myocardial injury (PMI) and its influence on the prognosis at follow-up are not completely clear. We used delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE MRI) to assess myonecrosis after PCI. Methods and Materials: Forty-three patients with stable coronary artery disease were studied with 1.5 T MRI before and after (within 72h) stenting of bifurcation lesions. The left ventricular function and LGE were assessed. We performed angiographic measurements of the vessel diameters, and bifurcation angles pre-and post-intervention. Systolic-to-diastolic increase of T1 was above average in lateral (p < 0.0001) and apical (p < 0.0001) segments. Conclusion: T1 relaxation times of normal myocardium differ significantly between diastole and systole at 1.5 T. Their strong correlation facilitates translation of diastolic and systolic T1 normal values. Regional deviations from the mean systolic-to-diastolic increase of T1 might be associated with regional differences in myocardial perfusion.",

Hamilton 1 ; 1 Bristol/UK, 2 Auckland/NZ Purpose: ECG-gated PCMRA is an established non-invasive in vivo method to measure blood flow. By default, the Siemens Argus PCMRA flow analysis software calculates a voxel averaged peak velocity. The voxel with the highest velocity in the data set is first determined. This value is then averaged with this the velocities of its neighbouring 4 voxels to generate the voxel averaged peak velocity. This may underestimate peak velocity. The aim of this study was to determine if voxel averaging leads to a lower calculated peak velocity. Methods and Materials: 145 peak velocity measurements in 14 different anatomical locations in 37 subjects (healthy volunteers, congenital and acquired heart disease patients) were analysed by default voxel averaging method and single voxel technique and compared. The effects of flow velocity, scan protocol (breath hold versus free breathing) and scanner type (Siemens Symphony versus Siemens Avanto) were also assessed. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. Results: There was a highly significant mean percentage increase in peak velocity of 7.1% when peak velocity was calculated by single voxel compared with voxel averaging technique (P < 0.0001). Significant increases in peak flow were observed by single voxel compared with voxel averaging regardless of patient type, anatomical location, CMR scanner or scan technique in terms of breathing command (p < 0.05). Disabling the voxel averaging technique had no effect on the volume of flow recorded.",

Purpose: To evaluate foetal brain maturation during twin pregnancies complicated with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Methods and Materials: Over a period of 4 years, we retrospectively evaluated 44 MRIs of women with monochorionic twin pregnancies complicated with TTTS. MRI scans were realized at an average of 31 weeks of gestation. All pregnancies complicated with TTTS and successfully treated with fetoscopic laser were included. Eighty-eight foetal brains were analysed and compared with an MRI brain atlas and with the co-twin. Biparietal brain diameter, cerebellar transverse diameter, sulcation, operculation, and myelination were analysed. Results: Among the 88 foetuses, 4 (4.2%) developed severe brain damage (unilateral brain atrophy, clastic lesion of corpus callosum with cyst) and showed unusual delay of brain maturation. In others cases of successfully treated TTTS, we found no difference in brain maturation between twins. Conclusion: Brain maturation during twin pregnancies with treated TTTS is well preserved except in cases with a severe vascular complication. Purpose: Very preterm infants suffer a wide range of neurodevelopmental disabilities. The purpose of the study was to assess the relationship between body growth and white matter (WM) microstructure maturation, in very low-birth weight, extremely preterm infants. Methods and Materials: Twenty-seven extremely premature infants (gestational age: 29.11\u00b11.9 weeks) with normal brain US studies and normal MRI at term equivalent age (41.1\u00b11.03 weeks) were enrolled in the study. Using a diffusion-weighted sequence, fractional anisotropy (FA) was measured bilaterally in 16 fibre tracts with the region-of-interest method. The effect of sex and the relationship between somatometric measurements (birth and body weight, crown to heel length and head circumference) and FA was evaluated using a general linear model. Two-tailed Student's t-test was used to assess differences between small for gestational age (SGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants. Results: A positive correlation was found between body weight and FA in the anterior corona radiata, the posterior limb of internal capsule, the external capsule, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the middle cerebellar peduncles and the fornix. Decreased FA was observed in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the fornix in SGA infants (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In extremely premature infants body growth correlates with changes in WM microstructure. Compromised growth at term equivalent age is associated with microstructural abnormalities in areas related to attention, language, memory and executive functioning.",

Methods and Materials: Questionnaires were developed and applied to 30 radiographers working in DM (computed-radiography or direct-digital-mammography/ (DDM)) in 5 hospitals to characterise the QC practices (guidelines in use, performed tests, tests frequency). Rejected/repeated analyses was performed in one hospital with DDM equipment using the checklist proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency/(IAEA). Results: Guidelines for QC are followed by 70% (20) of the radiographers: 55% follow American-guidelines, 20% the Portuguese, 15% the European/EUREF and 10% other guidelines. There is more than one guideline followed by radiographers in three institutions. The QC tests performed by radiographers in the same institution (proposed by IAEA to test image acquisition and display systems) were not the same and in the right frequency. The main causes for mammography image rejection/repetition were improper positioning in 85% of the analysed images due to non-inclusion of pectoral muscle in mediolateral oblique projection and inner and outer quadrants asymmetry for craniocaudal projection. Conclusion: In this group of hospitals with DM, there is no uniformity of QC practices. This can have impacts in mammography costs. This may be justified by the absence of certification programs concerning mammography departments. Continuous education and training programs frequency to work with DM are not mandatory and also QC is not required by law in Portugal.",

Ultrafast imaging sequence MRI is helpful to confirm, refine or exclude US diagnosis. It also provides useful informations in prenatal counselling and perinatal management. Purpose: In order to achieve high image quality with breast cancer screening mammography, the European guideline recommends training programs dedicated to radiographers. Those training programs are very helpful for practitioners but back at their workplace it might be difficult for them to apply the achieved knowledge in their daily practice. To support radiographers to transfer good mammography practice in their daily screening activity, an online portfolio is realized by each radiographer during the following 6 months after the training session. Methods and Materials: Every month, the trainee radiographer posts about 4 mammography examinations including the quality self-assessment on a dedicated electronic platform. Experienced radiographers from the screening program of western Switzerland comment the picture quality as well as the accuracy of the self assessment. Tips and tricks, to improve quality, are also given. Results: Actually 26 portfolios have been completed. The majority of the radiographers appreciated the personalized comments given by the experts. They found the tips very helpful and they say the portfolio helped them to continuously improve the quality of the performed mammograms. Nevertheless, some radiographers were upset because of the high time investment necessary to the realization of this kind of portfolio. Conclusion: In western Switzerland, where there are many decentralized breast cancer screening units, the online portfolio is an interesting tool to support radiographers with the development and the transfer of competences in their daily practice. Purpose: This study aimed at measuring patient satisfaction in mammography exams and satisfaction-related factors. Methods and Materials: Research was conducted in several private practice clinics with a total of 183 subjects using the Myasthenia Gravis questionnaire for assessing patient satisfaction concerning four dimensions: structure (physical environment), process (performing the exam), discomfort (physical and psychological) and general satisfaction (present and future). Results: Overall patient satisfaction was high (90%), with technical performance (process) and psychological discomfort having the major influence on patient satisfaction. Exam costs and age had very low, or no impact, on satisfaction. Also, the greater patient's education levels, the greater were their demands for process requirements, unlike patients with lower education levels which presented higher satisfaction levels.",

All constructs were labeled with AlexaFluor680 and injected in nude mice, bearing ART2-positive and ART2negative tumors. Circulating and excreted conjugates were monitored in plasma and urine and in vivo NIRF-imaging was performed over 24h. Tumor tissue penetration and target binding were analysed by FACS and fluorescence microscopy. Results: In vivo NIRF-imaging revealed specific labeling of ART2-positive tumors but not of ART2-negative tumors with all AF680-conjugates. The smaller nanobody and diabody revealed rapid renal elimination with highest signal-to-background ratios of ART2-positive tumors. The larger Fc-fusion protein and conventional antibody revealed long circulation times in plasma, resulting in unspecific background signals. FACS and Immunohistochemistry of tumors revealed deeper penetration and more homogenous labeling of tumor tissue with the nanobody and diabody than with the Fc-fusion protein and conventional antibody. Conclusion: Renally excreted small nanobody-formats (< 60kD) can be used for specific in vivo imaging of lymphomas with a significantly higher signal-tobackground ratio than larger antibody-constructs (> 60kD) that are retained in circulation. Therefore, single domain and bivalent nanobodies seem particularly suited for short-term diagnostic imaging, whereas reformatted nanobody-Fc fusion proteins appear suited for long-term applications.",

In vivo optical and MR-imaging was performed on mice with hind leg oedema. Results: A specific NIRF-(average fluorescence signal 0.004 scaled counts/s for 25 \u00b5g/ml NP) and MR-signal (1.5 T: r1=6 mM-1 * sec-1, r2=583 mM-1 * sec-1, r2*=613 mM-1 * sec-1) was detected for the bimodal NP in vitro. In vivo-MR and NIRF-imaging studies confirmed specific signalling of the particles within oedema. Conclusion: Our bimodal non-targeted fluorescent iron oxide NP successfully labelled cells of the MPS in vitro and in vivo without specific target recognition by antibodies. Additionally, the ability of specific NIR-signalling and MR-tracking of mononuclear cells makes them suitable for application as a simple and potent NIRF-optical and MRI contrast agent for visualisation of inflammatory diseases. Purpose: Quantitative T1-weighted perfusion imaging is promising. However, current software solutions are still semi-automatic and results are therefore potentially prone to observer-related bias. Surprisingly, this aspect of DCE-MRI is still poorly investigated.

Purpose: To determine whether MRI susceptibility-weighted imaging can assist in discriminating between inflammatory pathologies and high-grade glioma. Methods and Materials: Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) was performed at 3.0 T (Siemens Medical Systems) and images were reviewed retrospectively in 17 patients with cerebral inflammatory pathologies and 25 patients with histologically proven high-grade gliomas. Only gliomas without MR findings of haemorrhage on T1WI were included in the study. The morphological pattern of the susceptibility signal and the anatomic positional relationship between the contrast enhancement areas and susceptibility signals were retrospectively reviewed by consensus of 2 reviewers. The SWI morphological pattern was scored as: patchy, nodular, dot-like or linear and designated as inside or outside the zone of contrast enhancement. Results: In total, 17 clinically proven inflammatory diseases (7 parasitic granulomas, 3 inflammation-demyelinating and 7 neurovasculitis) and 23 lesions were reviewed. Patchy, nodular, dot-like susceptibility were demonstrated in both inflammatory and neoplastic lesions, whereas linear susceptibility signals were only identified in the inflammatory diseases. Nine of 23 (39%) susceptibility signals were situated outside the contrast enhancement areas in inflammatory pathologies with no susceptibility signals found outside the border of the contrast enhancement areas among all the high-grade gliomas. Conclusion: On SWI, linear susceptibility signal and/or susceptibility signal located outside the area of contrast enhancement was more frequently presented in inflammatory processes and not found with the high-grade gliomas. This finding may reflect a different pathophysiologic mechanism and distinction of bleeding/ microbleeding occurrence and presentation in inflammatory pathologies compared to high-grade gliomas.",

Purpose: The presence of intravertebral gas in the lumbar and thoracic spine, usually secondary to trauma, is a well-recognised radiological phenomenon (K\u00fcmmel's Disease). However, intravertebral gas within a cervical vertebral body is a common but unknown process. We present a series of 27 patients with gas in the cervical vertebral bodies, not associated with traumatism. The aim of this study is to describe this radiological finding and its possible aetiology. Methods and Materials: Our study group included 27 patients who underwent a routine neck CT examination for reasons not related with the cervical spine. All the patients presented air within a cervical vertebral body. We analysed several factors such as age, sex, location of the gas, history of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, the presence of degenerative disease, previous infections or corticosteroid therapy. Results: The mean age was 67 years (age range 29-82), 21 men and 6 women. The main affected body was C6 (48%), followed by C5 (33%).

High-spatial-resolution whole brain T1-weighted images were also acquired for image registration and normalisation into a standardised space within the SPM8. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) values of grey matter, white matter, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe, putamen, posterior cingulate, and thalamus were extracted for comparison, using WFU Pickatlas tool. The intra-and inter-scanner reliability was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC Purpose: To quantify the changes of myocardial transverse relaxation times (\u0394T2*) induced by hyperoxic respiratory challenge at different field strengths in an intraindividual comparison of healthy volunteers. Methods and Materials: Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data were acquired in ten healthy volunteers (5 women; 5 men; median age 29 years, range 22-35 years) at 1.5 T and 3.0 T. Medical air (21% O2), pure oxygen and carbogen (95% O2, 5%CO2) were alternatively administered in a block-design temporal pattern to induce normoxia, hyperoxia and hyperoxic hypercapnia, respectively. Parametrical T2* relaxation time maps were computed, average T2* values were derived from Region-of-Interest analysis by two independent and blinded readers in 16 standard myocardial segments on 3 short axis slices per patient. Results: Inter-and intra-reader correlations of T2* measurements were good (ICC=0.75 and ICC=0.79, both P < 0.001). Under normoxia, the mean T2* values were 30.6+7.0 ms at 1.5 T and 27.6+7.6 ms at 3.0 T. Both hyperoxic gases induced significant (P < 0.001) relaxation time increases \u0394T2* (oxygen: 1.5 T, 3.5+5.9 ms; 3.0 T, 2.1+6.3 ms; carbogen: 1.5 T, 2.9+7.1 ms; 3.0 T, 4.3+7.6sm). As opposed to 1.5 T, the magnitude of \u0394T2* response was higher at 3.0 T and under carbogen as compared with oxygen breathing (p < 0.01).",

            "text": "We prospectively evaluated 65 Patients with symptomatic CSM. The JOA (Japanese Orthopedic Association) myelopathy score was used to assess the clinical situation, dividing patients into groups with minimum myelopathy (MIM), moderate myelopathy (MOM) and severe myelopathy (SEM). All patients underwent examination on a 3.0 T MRI scanner (Verio, Siemens). DTI of the spinal cord was performed in 30 directions (b-value of 0 and 900). Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC), Eigenvalues (E1, E2.3) were measured. Results: Mean patient age was 58. 8 y/-12, 2 SD. According to the JOA Classification, 33 patients were classified into the MIM Group and 29 into the MOM and 3 into the SEM Group. Significant differences were seen in ADC (0.9\u00b10.2 vs 1.1\u00b10.2) values and FA (0.7\u00b10.1 vs 0.5\u00b10.1) when comparing normal with pathological levels as well as in E1 (1.9\u00b10.4 vs 2.3\u00b10.4) and E2.3 (0.37\u00b10.24 vs 0.5 \u00b1 0.29), respectively. Significant elevation of ADC and reduction of FA was seen in absolute vertebrostenotic segments. Significant Elevation of E1 and E2.3 were seen in vertebrostenotic segments compared with normal. Conclusion: Our results suggest a high sensitivity of DTI metrics in the assessment of CSM. Significant increases in longitudinal and transverse diffusion were seen in our results which might represent a novel biomarker of CSM. MOLLI was performed at a mid-ventricular slice location pre-and 4-20 min (2 min intervals) post-contrast administration. T1 values of the blood pool and the myocardium were measured for each time point and ECV assessment was based on myocardial \u0394R1 assessment (pre and post) in relation to \u0394R1 blood pool and incorporation of the haematocrit. Results: While pre-contrast T1 values were similar (p=0.3), post-contrast T1 values were significantly shorter at any measured time point post-injection after gadobutrol application (p < 0.047). Myocardial ECV data though calculated for both agents did not show significant differences (p> 0.21). In addition, ECV data related to both agents did not show any significant differences over the assessed time course of 4-20 min p.i. (p> 0.14, gadobutrol; p> 0.09, gadoterate meglumine). Conclusion: Gadobutrol leads to a significantly higher shortening of myocardial T1 values as compared to gadoterate meglumine. The ECV assessment which is independent of the CA properties can be adequately evaluated as early as 4 min p.i. in normal myocardium. Purpose: Existence of vortical blood flow in the main pulmonary artery as diagnostic criterion for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was analysed in 3-dimensional (3D) vector field and streamline representations. Methods and Materials: 50 subjects with known or suspected pulmonary hypertension (23 patients with and 27 without pulmonary hypertension, age 58\u00b113 years) underwent right heart catheterisation and time-resolved, 3D phase contrast imaging of the main pulmonary artery. Blood flow patterns were visualised as 3D velocity vector fields projected on 2-dimensional anatomical images (3D-vectors) and as 3D streamlines using 4D-Flow software (Siemens). Relative period of existence of vortical blood flow within the cardiac cycle (tvortex) was evaluated. Comparison of methods for using tvortex as diagnostic criterion for pulmonary hypertension was performed by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: Areas under the curve for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension did not differ significantly (p=0.30) and were 0.998 (95%-confidence interval 0.983 to 1.000) in case 3D-vector vortex detection and 0.991 (95%-confidence interval 0.948 to 0.999) in case of streamline vortex detection. The optimal tvortex cut-off value maximising sum of sensitivity and specificity was tvortex=0.15 for both visualisations. Resulting 95%-confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity were 0.86 to 1.00 and 0.82 to 0.99 in case 3D-vector vortex detection and 0.79 to 0.99 and 0.82 to 0.99 in case 3D streamline vortex detection. Conclusion: Main pulmonary artery blood flow patterns provide an accurate tool for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension with the optimal tvortex cut-off value 0.15.",

Greuter 1 ; 1 Groningen/NL, 2 Copenhagen/DK (m.j.w.greuter@umcg.nl) Purpose: To assess the feasibility of a new phantom which enables establishment of a calcium scoring protocol for multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) that yields calcium scores comparable to electron beam tomography (EBT) values and to physical mass. Methods and Materials: A phantom containing 100 small calcifications ranging 0.5-2.0 mm was scanned on EBT using a standard coronary calcium protocol, and on a 320-row MDCT scanner using different scanning, reconstruction and scoring parameters (tube voltage 80-135 kV, slice thickness 0.5-3.0 mm, reconstruction kernel FC11-FC15 and scoring threshold 110-150 HU). The Agatston and mass score were compared and the influence of the parameters was assessed. Results: On EBT, the Agatston and mass scores were 0-20, and 0-3 mg, respectively. On MDCT, the Agatston and mass scores were 0-20, and 0-4 mg, respectively. The Agatston score on MDCT differed 52% between 80 and 135 kV, 65% between 0.5 and 3.0 mm and 48% between FC11 and FC15. More calcifications were detected with a lower tube voltage, a smaller slice thickness, a sharper kernel and a lower threshold. An acquisition protocol with 100 kV and two reconstructions protocols could be defined. This protocol yielded Agatston scores as close to EBT as possible, as well as mass scores as close to physical mass as possible.

Study primary endpoints included technical success (defined as residual stenosis of the treated lesion > 30% without any significant dissection) and 1-year primary patency of the treated site (defined as angiographic visualisation of a patent lesion with < 50% restenosis and no need for any additional repeat procedure within the previously treated lesion due to failing access). Results: Baseline variables were comparably distributed among the two groups. Technical success was 100% for both groups. Additional post-dilation with a highpressure balloon was necessary in 11/20 (55%) of the PCB-treated cases. At 1 year, cumulative target lesion primary patency was significantly higher after PCB application (35% in PCB group versus 5% in PBA group, p < 0.001, HR (95%CI) = 0.27 (0.13-0.58)).

This preliminary study included 5 in vivo porcine models. Images were evaluated by experienced cardiologists with respect to noise, temporal resolution and artefact susceptibility. Results: An enhancement of temporal resolution was shown by a decreased fullwidth at half maximum of catheter cross sections using SR 4D-FD-CT as compared to static reconstructions. Motion-map-processing of individual phases increased the contrast-to-noise ratio for each heart phase, e.g. in the left ventricle by an average of 30%.

Inclusion criteria were native single or multiple stenosis or occlusion (mean lesion length 7.5 \u00b1 3.5 cm) in the femoro-popliteal or below the knee (BTK) regions. Dilatation was performed in each group either for native lesions (26 DEB; 30 NCB) or post-stent implantation (31 DEB; 35 NCB). Primary end points were late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 and 12 months. Secondary end-points were target lesion revascularisation (TLR), amputation and thrombosis rate. Results: One-hundred-twenty-two lesions were treated: 75.4% in the femoropopliteal area; 24.6% BTK; 21.3% total occlusions.

Immediate technical success, disease-free patient survival and target lesion revascularisation (TLR) rates were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Technical success rate was 98% with a lesion length of 80\u00b156 mm. Limbsalvage and survival rates were 87.5 and 90.3% at 2 years, respectively. At 6, 12 and 24 months disease-free patient survival was 88.7, 79.9 and 64.6%. Whereas adjunctive PTA was performed in 32% cases to improve the angiographic result, 12% required an associated tibial vessel treatment. No perioperative mortality was observed. One complication (2%) occurred. Conclusion: Percutaneous directional atherectomy is a safe and effective technique in lower limb revascularisation. Preliminary results supported by short-mid term data encourage use of DA with SilverHawk and TurboHawk catheter in the femoro-popliteal obstructive lesions also in traditionally \"forbidden districts\".

All received CT guided direct sac puncture under local anaesthesia, followed by CT fluoroscopic embolisation with Onyx 34\u00ae or 20\u00ae. Follow-up examination included contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and dual-phase CT angiography every 6 months for at least 2 years (ongoing). Results: Technical success was achieved in all cases, requiring dual puncture of the aneurysm sac in 8 cases (47.1%). Average duration of the procedure was 60 \u00b1 12 min. In mean 7.5 ml of Onyx 34\u00ae were used per procedure. In 6 cases Onyx 20\u00ae was additionally used for complete filling of the endoleak. Repeat intervention was necessary in 3 cases (17.3%) due to new endoleak development in the follow-up period of 12 \u00b1 8 months. The procedure failed permanently in 1 case. Complications such as major bleeding, spinal ischaemia or non-target embolisations were not observed. Conclusion: Completely CT-guided treatment of lafT2E is a feasible and safe treatment alternative. Difficulties lay in the determination of the necessary amount of Onyx and the end point of the intervention. Several punctures as well as repeat intervention might be necessary to achieve permanent endoleak occlusion. Purpose: Treatment of type 1 endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) can be challenging. We describe a technique for direct embolisation with the liquid embolic agent ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer Onyx by direct catheter access to the endoleak, and present first results. Methods and Materials: 18 patients (16 male, 2 female, mean age 72 +-7 yrs) with a type 1a (n = 13) or a type 1b (n = 5) endoleak were treated. In 13 cases, it was applied as stand-alone procedure, and in 5 cases in combination with stent graft extension. Access was trans-brachial for type 1a endoleaks, and trans-inguinal for type 1b endoleaks. A multi-purpose catheter was placed between the aortic wall and the stent graft to access the endoleak, followed by coaxial introduction of a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) compatible micro-catheter into the endoleak, and consecutive Onyx embolisation. Results: Technical success was achieved in all cases. A mean volume of 11 ml +-5 ml of Onyx 34 was used. In 5 cases, additional coils were used as an anchor for Onyx. 1 patient developed reperfusion of the endoleak during follow-up of 12 +-8 months, which was successfully treated with the same technique. Non-target embolisation, catheter encasement, or anaphylactic reactions to DMSO were not observed.",

Conclusion: Image fusion road-mapping for EVRTAAA is feasible and is associated to a statistically significant reduction in contrast volume and a trend towards DAP reduction while maintaining similar procedure time. The medium term follow-up was 24 months. Cross-tabulations were checked with chi-squared test, or by Fisher's exact test. Survivorships were analysed by Kaplan-Meyer product limit method and by Cox semiparametric regression. Results: Technical success was achieved in 98.7%. 14/77 presented endoleaks during the follow-up (type 1=7, type 2=6 and type 3=1). During the follow-up there were 7 mortalities, mean time 19.82 months (range 3-48). In survival rates there was no difference between hybrid procedures group (p=0.3387) and elective or emergency group (p=0.3608). There was a statistical difference on survival between the group that had endoleaks during the follow-up (p=0.0093) and who had had necessity of a second endovascular interventional (p=0.0184). Statistical difference on survival was also seen between patients who developed type 1 and 2 endoleaks (p=0.0336). Conclusion: TEVAR is a safe and effective treatment. The presence of endoleak, special type 1 and the necessity of a second endovascular intervention reduces significantly the survival.",

CVA from embolic infarctions occurred in two patients (7.4%). Transient left arm ischaemic symptoms were present in 5 patients (18.5%), but none required secondary interventions. Delayed development of type I endoleak occurred due to stent deformity in one patient, who underwent surgery. One patient required re-intervention after a pseudoaneurysm developed at the distal margin of the previously placed stent-graft at ten-month follow-up CECT. Hypertrophy of the right VA after TEVAR was seen in 7 of 27 patients (25.9%); two patients showed bilateral hypertrophy of VAs. Conclusion: LSCA coverage without recanalization can be safely performed during TEVAR in patients with patent vertebro-vertebral communications. Hypertrophy of the right VA was noted in 25.9% of patients after LSCA coverage. Purpose: Double-bundle reconstruction with stump preservation has revolutionised the surgical treatment for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, poor revascularization at the osteoligamentous interface (OI) of the tibia tunnel remains a major cause of graft complications. In this study, we applied dynamic contrastenhanced (CE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify the OI enhancement values of the tibia tunnels and ACL stump. We aimed to determine the relationship between graft complications and OI and stump enhancements. Methods and Materials: From October 2011 to April 2012, 34 patients were enrolled in our study (mean postoperative duration, 7.3 months). All patients underwent one 1.5-T MRI study with the imaging pulse-sequence protocol of proton density-weighted imaging (WI), T2WI, pre-enhanced and post-enhanced T1WI, and dynamic CE MRI. Graft complications, including cystic degeneration and tear, were evaluated using pre-enhanced MRI, and peak enhancement (ePeak) values were acquired from a dynamic CE study. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to obtain optimal cut-off values for complicated grafts. Results: Our study included 28 patients (mean age, 25.5 years). Nine patients (32.1%) had cystic degeneration and 1 (3.6%) had complete posterolateral (PL) bundle tear. Mean ePeak percentages for graft with or without complications were 84.19%/127.69% for anterior--medial (AM) bundle, 107.54%/128.21% for PL bundle, and 171%/151.06% for stump, respectively. ROC analysis yielded the optimal ePeak cut-off values of 126%, 104%, and 35% for AM bundle, PL bundle, and stump, respectively. Conclusion: Graft complications were directly associated with higher tibial OI values but inversely associated with higher stump values. Purpose: To test if the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) index is predictive of rotational knee kinematics during pivoting activities and anterior tibial translation (ATT) in patients after anatomic single-bundle (SB) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).",

Caulo 1 ; 1 Chieti/IT, 2 L'Aquila/ IT (lorisdiclemente@gmail.com) Purpose: The evaluation of knee stability is currently based on tibio-femoral sagittal plane motion measurement as evaluated using the KT-1000 arthrometer. Conventional MRI cannot evaluate knee stability. The aim of the study was to assess the use of MR-Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) as a tool for a microstructural examination of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and to correlate DTI finding with clinically evaluated stability. Methods and Materials: 11 subjects (6 females) without previous history of knee injuries underwent MRI using conventional and DTI sequences. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were calculated in each anterior and posterior cruciate ligament within 3 different ROIs placed in the lower, middle and upper portion of the ligaments. Knee stability was assessed using KT-1000 arthrometer in 4 progressive active displacements: 15 lbs, 20 lbs, manual maximum displacement and under quadricipital muscle contraction. Statistical analysis was performed using Independent t-Test and Kendall tau rank correlation test, where appropriate (p < 0.05). Results: FAs of the ACL (mean: 0.573\u00b10.047) were significantly lower compared with the PCL (mean: 0.676\u00b10.046) (p < 0.001), whereas no side differences were noted. A significant negative correlation between FA and KT-1000 arthrometer values at 15 lbs was present in the PCL (r=-0.341; p=0.029). No correlations were observed between the FA and KT-1000 values in the ACL. Conclusion: Functional assessment of the microstructural organisation of the cruciate ligaments with DTI expands MRI applications beyond simple morphological studies and could help bridge the gap between imaging and clinical evaluation of knee stability.",

Logistic regressions revealed a significant impact of increasing amounts of tibial plateau fracture depression on the incidence of meniscus lateralis tears (P = 0.025) and lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament (P = 0.018). Analysis of covariance demonstrated a significant correlation between the amount of articular depression and the absolute number of soft-tissue injuries (P = 0.001).

Diederichs; Berlin/ DE (bernd.vollnberg@charite.de) Purpose: To assess anatomical risk factors in patients after lateral patellar dislocation (LPD) and controls using MRI. Methods and Materials: MR images of 186 knees after LPD and of 186 age-and gender-matched controls were analysed. The presence of trochlear dysplasia was assessed by evaluation of trochlear inclination, facet asymmetry, and trochlear depth; patella alta was evaluated by Insall-Salvati-index and Caton-Deschampsindex; and lateralized force vector was measured by the tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance. Results: Compared with controls, dislocators had significantly lower values for all three parameters of trochlear dysplasia (-32%, -32%, -44%) and significantly higher values for patella alta (+14%, +13%) and TT-TG (+49%) (all P < 0.001). Trochlear dysplasia was observed in 112 dislocators (66%), of whom 61 (36%) additionally had patella alta and 15 (9%) an abnormal TT-TG. As isolated risk factors, patella alta (15%) and abnormal TT-TG (1%) were rare. Only 25 dislocators (15%) had no anatomical risk factor. Trochlear dysplasia in conjunction with abnormal TT-TG or patella alta is associated with a 37-fold and 41-fold higher risk. Conclusion: Most dislocators have anatomical risk factors, varying in severity and constellation. Trochlear dysplasia is the main risk factor for LPD, while patellar alta and abnormal tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance may be additional factors. Patient-specific evaluation of risk factors following LPD may help future management.",

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the impact of meniscal tears on adjacent, morphologically intact knee cartilage using T2 relaxation time, a sensitive biomarker for early cartilage degeneration, and compare with healthy controls. Methods and Materials: Sixty-nine subjects without evidence of OA were recruited from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Thirty-five Subjects (26-women) with a normal medial meniscus were used as controls (age 61\u00b18, BMI 27\u00b15). Thirty-four subjects (20-women) had either a simple (non-displaced tear; n=19, age 61\u00b19, BMI 28\u00b15) or complex tear (displaced tear; n=15, age 60\u00b19, BMI 29\u00b15) of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. None of the tear-subjects had morphological lesions of the medial tibio-femoral cartilage. T2-measurements were performed in the whole medial tibia (MT) and the medial femur compartments (MF), and in tibio-femoral subregions adjacent to the torn meniscus (sMT & sMF). Multiple linear-regression models were used to compare mean T2-values of individuals with meniscal tears with normal controls. Purpose: Patients with good or complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation have excellent long-term outcome. Minimal invasive treatment (i.e. transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and wait-and-see policy) are increasingly considered as an alternative to major surgery. With this prospective cohort study we aimed to evaluate long-term outcome of strictly MR-based selected patients who have been treated with minimal invasive treatment. Methods and Materials: Eight weeks after chemoradiation, endoscopy and restaging MRI were performed (including diffusion-weighted MRI for yT-staging and gadofosveset-enhanced MRI for yN-staging). Complete responders were selected for wait-and-see policy and good responders with small tumour remnant for TEM. Both treatment groups underwent intensive 3-to-6 monthly follow-up, using MR imaging (DWI+gadofosveset), CEA, CT of thorax and abdomen and endoscopy was performed. Long-term outcome was estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: Forty-one patients were included, thirty-three in the wait-and-see group and eight in the TEM-group. Mean follow-up was 26 months (range 6-91). For the TEM-group, 4 patients had ypT0 and 4 had ypT2. Two patients, both in the wait-and-see group, developed a local recurrence within two years and underwent surgery, leading to a 2-year local recurrence rate of 9%. Both recurrences were detected on (DWI-)MRI in an early stage. The cumulative probabilities of 2-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 93% and 100%, respectively. No recurrences occurred in the TEM-group. Conclusion: Both selection and follow-up of good and complete responders after chemoradiation for rectal cancer with MRI is feasible. Long-term outcome so far is excellent. (DWI-)MRI seems to be a reliable tool for early recurrence detection.",

We compared a semiquantitative dynamic feature, the standardised index of shape (SIS) and the diffusion parameters obtained using intravoxel incoherent method. Purpose: To compare image quality and detection of clinical findings of the new WARP sequence versus conventional optimised MR sequences in patients with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods and Materials: Forty-two patients with TKA underwent 1.5 T MRI in this prospective study. Slice-encoding metal artefact correction (SEMAC), view-angle tilting (VAT), and increased bandwidth were combined by the \"WARP\"-turbo spin echo sequence. Twenty-four patients underwent CT as a reference standard. Coronal STIR-WARP and sagittal intermediate-weighted (PD) WARP-sequences were compared to standard sequences optimised with high readout bandwidth (STIR-hiBW/PD-hiBW). Signal void was quantified. Qualitative criteria (depiction of anatomy, distortion, blurring, noise) were assessed on a five-point scale (1, no artefacts; 5, severe artefacts) by two readers. Clinical findings (e.g. periprosthetic osteolysis) were noted. A t-test (quantitative data) and a Wilcoxon signed rank test (qualitative data) served for statistics. Results: Signal void areas were smaller for STIR-WARP than STIR-hiBW (mean; 20.1 cm 2 /27.0 cm 2 ), and for PD-WARP than PD-hiBW (14.2 cm 2 /16.5 cm 2 ; p <.001 for all comparisons). Depiction of anatomic structures was better on STIR-WARP versus STIR-hiBW (2.9-3.7 vs. 4.2-4.9; p <.001), and on PD-WARP versus PD-hiBW (2.5-3.5 vs. 3.1-3.8; p <.007). Distortion and image noise were lower for WARP than for the standard sequences (p <.002), while blurring was similar for both techniques. There was a statistically significant advantage for detection of clinical findings for STIR-WARP versus STIR-hiBW (74 and 37 findings; p <.001) and for PD-WARP versus PD-hiBW (63 and 34 findings; p <.001).",

Those patients underwent a neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy followed by MR scans.

Results: Following neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy, we observed 23 (59%) patients with a rectum disease staged \u00b2 T2 and 16 (41%) patients with a disease staged > T2, after MR images analysis. Post-treatment histological staging (TNM) analysis revealed 13 patients with a disease > T2 and 26 patients with a disease \u00b2 T2. By arranging the Kappa Cohen test to find the agreement value between post-chemoradiation MR staging and histological response, we found that with a disease confined to the sierosa (\u00b2 T3) the agreement was 83.6%. We found an agreement of 97.22% between MR and histology for a disease \u00b2 N1 and an accord of 33.33% for a disease more advanced than N1 (> N1). Conclusion: MR is critical in discovering a T3 disease; moreover, with morphologic MR Imaging we do not have always the opportunity to discern a few residual cancer cells hidden in the fibrotic tissue that could cause a CRM involvement on histology.",

Purpose: To show the utility of MDCT assessing the tumour response in locally advanced colon cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: 22 consecutive patients who underwent this therapy during a 15-month period were included. All tumours were staged before treatment using MDCT 64 or PET-CT scan, and after neoadjuvant treatment other scan was performed by calculating the differences in tumour volumes making use of a dedicated software for semiautomatic volume segmentation, to assess tumour response before surgery. Maximum standard uptake value (SUV max) by PET-CT between the time of initial diagnosis and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was also measured. Surgical-related complications and oncological outcomes were obtained. Results: Tolerance to chemotherapy was excellent in 86.4% of patients and 95.5% completed the entire chemotherapy initially planned. After neoadjuvant treatment, 69.5% reduction of tumour volume was observed by CT-scan and up to 59.9% decrease of SUVmax (Standard Uptake Value) was achieved by PET/ MDCT. None of the patients showed tumour progression during the preoperative treatment, and all of them underwent the previously planned surgical procedure. Four patients developed postoperative complications. Median time between the end of chemotherapy and surgery was 22 days. Conclusion: Preoperative chemotherapy induces a tumour response that can be measured by imaging methods (MDCT).",

Methods and Materials: A 22-cm diameter water phantom containing different iodine contrast inserts from 2.5 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml was scanned on seven CT scanners from four manufacturers using the Perfusion CT acquisition protocols of a multi-centre clinical trial in colorectal cancer (PROSPeCT). All acquisition protocols employed 100 kV and ~5 mm reconstructed slice. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection and iterative reconstruction, where available. CT numbers and background noise levels were measured and displayed CTDIvol values noted. A sub-set of measurements was obtained on a 30-cm diameter phantom. The relationship between CT number and iodine density was determined for all datasets and CNR values calculated. Results: A linear relationship between CT number and iodine density was observed, with small variations between CT scanners. No change in linearity was observed with IR of different 'strengths'. CTDIvolvalues varied by a factor > 2. For the lowest density insert, CNR varied from 2.9 to 4.4. With IR, CNR increased by a factor of 1.15 to 2.3 depending on IR'strength'.

Methods and Materials: Following IRB approval, 14 patients (11 male, mean 68.3years) with primary rectal cancer underwent two baseline MRIs. T2-W axial sequences were exported for texture analysis (TexRAD, University of Sussex). A Laplacian of Gaussian band-pass filter was applied to highlight different spatial scales (fine (1.0), medium (1.5-2.0) and coarse (2.5) texture). Texture was quantified as entropy (E), uniformity (U), kurtosis (K), skewness (S) and standard deviation of the histogram (SDH) and recorded as for absolute scale values for each tumour. Greater heterogeneity is represented by higher E, greater K, S and SDH and lower uniformity. Overall group median values were recorded and reproducibility (testretest agreement) was assessed using Bland-Altman statistics. Results: All tumours were greater than Stage II; mean length 5.5 cm. Good reproducibility was achieved across all filters (1.0-2.5) for E, U and SDH with mean differences ranging from -0.007 to +0.002 for E; -0.11X10 -3 to + 0.001 X10 -3 for U; and +1.60 to +4.97 for SDH; and within subject coefficients of variation from 2.09-2.55% for E, 10.3-12.7% for U, and 14.3-16.1% for SDH. There was greater variability for K and S: mean differences ranged from +0.168 to + 0.334 for K; and +0.089 to +0.272 for S; within subject coefficients of variation from 31.3-93.7% for K, and 21.5-49.6% for S.

Methods and Materials: Fifteen female patients with 15 breast lesions were included in this study. CEDEM was performed with a Mammomat Inspiration prototype (Siemens, Germany) before and after i.v. administration of 2-ml Iomeron\u00ae 400 (Bracco, Italy) per kg b.w. at a rate of 3.5 ml/sec. Dual-energy images were acquired with 28-32 kVp and a W/Rhodium (Rh) anode/filter combination for lowenergy and 49 kVp and a W/Ti anode filter combination for high energy. Weighted subtraction images were computed for diagnostic work-up. Images were assessed by two readers with respect to lesion-enhancement and image quality. A histological work-up was performed in all lesions. Results: Histopathology revealed eight malignant lesions and seven benign lesions (size range from 8 to 38 mm). All malignant lesions enhanced and were seen from both readers on weighted subtraction images. Benign lesions did not enhance thus they were not visualised on weighted subtraction images. Image quality was rated excellent from both readers. Based on the visibility of the lesion CEDEM allowed an accurate differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions. Conclusion: CEDEM with a W/Ti anode/filter combination is suitable and feasible. Lesion visibility and image quality were excellent.

Results: CT-enteroclysis provided the best distension of jejunal loops (median diameter 27 mm; range 17-32 mm) compared with all other techniques (p < 0.0001). Frequency of patients with an adequate distension of the terminal ileum was not significantly different among the four groups (p=0.0608).

Adverse effects were more frequent in patients from the CT-enteroclysis group (p < 0.0028). Conclusion: CT-enteroclysis allows an optimal distension of jejunal loops, but it is the most uncomfortable CT protocol.

Results: Twelve nephrostomies in 10 patients (median age 64 yrs, range 29-91 yrs, 6 females and 4 males) were performed and reviewed. The renal pelvicalyceal system was visualised in both CEUS and fluoroscopic nephrostograms in 11/12 (92%) with one nephrostomy tube identified as being misplaced. The entire ureter was visualised in 6/12 (50%) with a CEUS nephrostogram compared with 8/12 (75%) using traditional nephrostogram. Fluoroscopic nephrostogram showed drainage of contrast into the bladder in 10/12 (83%) cases compared with 9/12 (75%) using CEUS. Conclusion: Preliminary results suggest that CEUS nephrostogram is a feasible method to confirm the correct positioning of the nephrostomy tube, image the ureters and determine if there is satisfactory drainage into the bladder. CEUS nephrostogram is a suitable alternative for the traditional nephrostogram in patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast agents or if the procedure needs to be performed at the bedside.",

Anomalous IVC was identified in 8 patients (3.9%) in HSK patients: 1 preisthmic IVC with retrocaval ureter, 4 double IVCs, 2 left IVC, and 1 IVC with azygos continuation and 12 patients (0.6%) in NK patients: 8 double IVCs, 3 left IVC, and one IVC with azygos continuation. There was a significantly higher prevalence of anomalous VC in patients with HSK than in those NK on MDCT (P < 0.001). Conclusion: HSK patients were frequently found anomalous VC and detection of those anomalies in HSK patients is important during central venous catheter procedures and operation.",

Results: Distinct differentiation on enhancement patterns was observed between Leydig cell and germ cell tumours. All 11 Leydig cell tumours displayed intense early enhancement which persisted for longer than the normal testicular parenchymal enhancement. The germ cell tumours showed loss of the normal linear vascular pattern, but with a more rapid washout of contrast. Quantitative analysis confirms the observation, with longer full width at maximum (FWHM) and slower contrast outflow on the time-intensity curves observed in Leydig cell tumours comparing to germ cell tumours. With improved diagnostic confidence, testicular-sparing excisions were performed for 5 lesions following pre-operative CEUS analysis and unnecessary orchidectomies avoided.",

Results: Lymphoma patients' age range was 34-76 years. Six had testicular involvement in systemic disease or recurrence; four had primary disease. One had bilateral involvement. Seven testes in 6 patients were diffusely involved (4 homogeneously; 3 heterogeneously); four had nodular hypoechoic lesions which, in 1 testis, were multiple. All lesions, either focal or diffuse, were hypervascular, with vessels of normal rectilinear shape. In patients with nodular lesions, there was no distorsion of vascular course at the point where vessels entered the mass. Findings suggested an infiltrative process, and were confirmed at pathology. The remaining seven patients had history and US features suggesting testicular lymphoproliferative disease. All had hypoechoic focal hypervascular lesions containing vessels with rectilinear course that were eventually proved inflammatory changes (2 chronic focal orchitis, 2 idiopathic granulomatous orchitis, 2 brucellosis, 1 tuberculosis). Conclusion: In patients over 60 and/or with known lymphoproliferative disease, the presence of hypoechoic, hypervascular testicular lesion with absence of vascular distorsion must suggest lymphoma. Care must be taken since, albeit rarely, inflammatory lesions may present the same imaging pattern in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of inflammation. Purpose: To assess the influence of region of interest (ROI) size and positioning on parameters of perfusion and permeability and inter-and intraobserver variability of DCE-MRI of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and metastases. Methods and Materials: 33 patients with RCC and 17 patients with metastases were examined with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI at 1.5 T with a half body weight-adapted dose of gadobutrol. Analysis with a two-compartment exchange model provided four parameters: plasma flow (Fp), plasma volume (Vp), permeability-surface-product (Ps) and interstitial volume (VEE). Arterial input function and retrospective respiratory triggering were applied. ROIs of the whole tumour, circular edge and an arbitrary vital region were defined on morphological sequences and on parametric plasma flow maps. consider tube current modulation (TCM). The aim of this study was to include TCM effects in MC dose simulations and to validate this approach. Methods and Materials: All measurements were performed on a SOMATOM Definition Flash scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany) using three anthropomorphic phantoms: adult Alderson-Rando, 5-year-old child and 1-yearold child. The phantoms were scanned with a trunk protocol using an online TCM system (CareDose4, Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany). Organ dose values were measured using 94 calibrated thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) for each phantom. MC simulations were performed using ImpactMC software (CT Imaging GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) based on the 3D voxelised data derived from acquired CT images. The tool was modified to take TCM curves into account. The current values for different tube positions were extracted from the raw data using manufacturer software. Simulated dose values were compared with TLD measurements on a chip-by-chip basis. Results: For MC calculations without taking TCM data into account the mean differences between measured and simulated dose values amounted to 92%, 83%, 71% for adult, 5-year-old child and 1-year-old phantoms, while modelling with TCM reduced the mean differences to 5.3%, 7.5% and 6.4%, respectively. Conclusion: MC dose estimates including TCM data were in good agreement with measurements. This technique can significantly improve the accuracy of 3D-dose assessment.",

Methods and Materials: 28 patients (13M, 15 F; mean age\u00b1SD, 66\u00b116) with known or suspected peripheral arterial disease underwent single contrast medium dose (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) 1.5-T MRA using 2DixFS during first arterial passage of contrast material. Results were compared with data obtained using a conventional, subtraction-based approach. A phantom study was performed to assess signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of both MRA techniques. Vessel-to-background (VTB) contrast and SNR were measured and compared with the paired samples t-test. Two experienced observers scored subjective image quality. Fisher's exact test was used to compare subjective image quality. Agreement regarding subjective image quality was expressed in quadratic weighted \u03ba values. Results: Patient data showed improved VTB contrast in all anatomical locations with 2DixFS versus the conventional, subtraction-based MRA method (all P < 0.001). Subjective image quality was uniformly higher with 2DixFS when compared with subtracted images. In all cases this was significant (P < 0.03), except the aortoiliac arteries for observer 1 (P=0.052). Phantom studies indicated a 15% higher SNR with the Dixon technique (31.9 vs 27.6). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of single contrast medium dose subtractionless lower extremity MRA using 2DixFS method.

Methods and Materials: Prospectively, 52 patients without any known cardiovascular disease (34 men, 18 woman, mean age 50.1\u00b17.4 years) but suffering from cardiovascular risk factors such as arterial hypertension [AHT], impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidaemia and obesity, were clinically assessed including family history, blood collection, blood pressure assessment and oral glucose tolerance test. Furthermore, the carotid intima-media thickness [CIMT], potentially indicative for atherosclerotic disease was assessed by ultrasound and a WB-MR angiography (1.5 T, Avanto, Siemens Medical Solutions) containing an examination of the of renal artery using respiratory triggered (RT) or breath held (BH) in reference to dynamic contrast MRA (CMRA). Methods and Materials: 33 patients were involved (median age 61 years). RT and BH NC MRAs using PG were obtained at 3 T (Discovery MR750, GEHC) using Inflow inversion recovery (IFIR) 3D FIESTA with fan beam k-space view ordering in a coronal plane. CMRA with 3D EFGRE was obtained as reference [0.1 mmol/kg Gd-chelate, injection 3 ml/sec]. Evaluation, image quality, artefacts (1 undiagnostic-5 excellent) and visualisation of aorta and renal arteries were ranked with 5-point scale. Contrast was calculated (SI artery/surrounding tissue). Wilcoxon signed rank test and Student's t test with Bonferroni correction was used for statistical evaluation. Results: ALL NCMRAs were diagnostic (3.7-4.7). Scores for image quality and artefacts of RT NCMRA were better than those of BH NCMRA (NS) although visualisation of aorta was slightly better with BH than RT NCMRA. RT NCMRA provided better visualisation of distal renal arteries and better contrast than those with CMRA (p < 0.05). Contrasts of aorta and proximal renal arteries were slightly better in CMRA than those in NCMRAs (NS). Conclusion: With PG, homogenous SI in aorta was obtained in NCMRA. When image quality of RT NCMRA is not enough to evaluate arteries, BH NCMRA can be used as substitute. Purpose: To evaluate the quality, the diagnostic performance and the radiation exposure of low-kV CT angiography protocol (100 kV) with ultra low-contrast medium volume (40 mL) in the assessment of the aorta disease. Methods and Materials: Seventy patients with thoracic or abdominal aortic disease were prospectively examined with 256MDCT scan (Brilliance iCT, Philips) using ultra low-dose radiation protocol (100 kV; automated tube current modulation) and ultra low-contrast volume (40 mL; 4 mL/s; 350 mgI/mL). In the thoracic aorta assessment we performed ECG-gated retrospective protocol, necessary for the evaluation of ascending aorta. Density measurements were performed on ascending, arch, descending, abdominal aorta, renal arteries and common iliac arteries. A control groups of 50 patients who underwent standard CT-angiography protocol (120 kV; 350 mAs) and standard contrast volume (120 mL) were also evaluated. The obtained data in terms of radiation dose exposure (dose-length product, DLP), administered contrast and intravessels density were compared and statistically analysed. Results: In every CT-exam we could correctly visualise and evaluate main branch of thoracic and abdominal aorta. No significant difference of density measurements was achieved between the low-kV protocol: mean attenuation value of thoracic aorta 304 HU, abdominal aorta 343 HU and renal arteries 331 HU; and control group: mean value of thoracic aorta 320 HU, abdominal aorta 339 HU and renal arteries 303 HU. The radiation dose exposure in low-kV protocol was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in comparison with control group, obtaining the following value for thoracic scan: 490DLP and abdominal scan: 335DLP, while in control group we obtained for the thoracic scan: DLP625 and for the abdominal scan: DLP952, respectively. Conclusion: Low-kV protocol provides a comparable diagnostic performance with standard protocol, decreasing significantly the radiation dose exposure (over 40%) and allowing also a significant reduction of contrast material volume (40 mL), preserving renal function.",

Results: AKC maps revealed additional information for tissue characterisation. In ischaemia, AKC demonstrated more details of pathologic tissue changes and provided information about prognosis. In tumours, AKC maps were used for discriminating low-grade from high-grade lesions revealing a better accuracy than conventional diffusion parameters. Conclusion: AKC maps are non-invasive methods that are well tolerated by paediatric patients and that provide a more detailed characterisation of neural tissue in the clinical context.

In this context, the role of traumatic subdural hygromas (SDHy) as possible acute or chronic finding in child abuse, especially in shaken-baby-syndrome, is not well understood and still a matter of debate. By modern imaging techniques, the present study aimed to investigate the characteristics of SDHy.

An online survey was performed to evaluate current practice. Methods and Materials: A survey was developed comprising of twelve questions, by using 'Survey Monkey', which aimed to identify the variances present in conducting myocardial stress testing and in clinical protocol details if available. Professional groups working in Nuclear Medicine, such as the medical-physicsengineering community and virtual radiopharmacy, were targeted. Access to the survey remained open for eight months. Forty-three members, including both radiographers and medical physicists responded from across Europe and Australasia. SPSS was used to evaluate the results obtained, based on Chi-square tests and comparisons between multiple responses. Results: The majority (72%) of the participants were from United Kingdom, 18% from other European countries and 9% from Australasia. In 39 centres pharmacological stress testing was performed either alone or in conjunction with exercise stress testing. The results indicated that 60% of the participants were aware of local stress test protocols; however, guidelines indicating which patients were not suitable for pharmacological stress tests may require clarification. Conclusion: Results suggest that for pharmacological stress testing there is a need for increased awareness of protocols, and across all responders the need for improved knowledge and understanding of local protocols was identified. This initial survey justifies further research towards increase protocol compliance and standardisation of practice during myocardial stress testing.",

This study aimed to clarify the EMF Directive 2004/40/EC discussion which imposes limits to electromagnetic fields (EMF) regarding the occupational exposure. Methods and Materials: It was explored policy documents, regulations, guidelines, laws and other official documents on this subject. To understand the reason of this controversy, the evidence of consequences from the EMF exposure over professionals was analysed. From the information obtained an online survey was developed, with national and international coverage, towards 11 professional groups considered involved in the controversy. The opinions were analysed by the force field analysis diagram, through the Policymaker K4-health\u2122 application to speculate the influences, forces, power and strategies developed in this process. Results and Conclusion: From 50 respondents 62% do not know the ESR's position, the Directive and its contents. 60% know the safety measures to apply in the MR room and report adverse events for lack of compliance with safety standards, being the levels of SAR, the most topic referred. They do not know the limits imposed and have no opinion about the Directive's controversy (40%). The political impact is considered neutral (49%) against the negative clinical and economic impacts (54%) that falls over the equipment manufacturers (62%). The professional societies have most decision, followed by physicists, doctors, manufacturers, government decision-makers and health-managers. The manufacturers, radiographers and supervisors have median influence, and the patients have weak influence over this process.

Purpose: Scout images are essential in neuroradiology. Though these images may have limited diagnostic quality, they visualise larger parts of the body. Therefore, certain radiologic findings may be visualised only or largely in the scout images and truly constitute unexpected radiologic findings (UF). Impact related to spinal location and imaging modality on to the incidence and distribution of UF remains unknown. Methods and Materials: 500 patients undergoing CT and 500 patients undergoing MRI of spinal column between 11/01/2009 and 1/31/2010 are included. UF reported in the original dictations are separated into 3 groups: scout only (I), scout+diagnostic images (II) and diagnostic images (III) only. In addition to type of imaging and spinal location, locations and organ system of these findings are recorded. Results: There were 81 UF in CT and 113 in MRI group. In both groups, patients with UF were significantly older than the ones without UF, with a slight female preponderance. Majority of UF in CT were seen in diagnostic images. UF seen only in scout images of CT were exception although these were significant findings. UF distribution in MRI was more even. Equal numbers of UF were seen in groups II and III. Approximately 17% of UF seen in MRI were present in group I. Conclusion: Scout images of neuroradiologic studies may harbour significant number UF. This is especially true in MRI where 17% of UF seen only in scout images. Although UF seen solely in scout images of CT is rare, these are predominantly significant findings.",

Purpose: To determine whether contrast agent (CA) dose reduction to one-half and one-quarter of the standardised dosage allows for preserved image quality of renal MR angiography at 7T. Methods and Materials: MR examinations were performed in 6 healthy subjects on a 7T MR system (Magnetom 7T), utilising a custom-built 8-channel RF body coil. Dynamic 3D FLASH data sets were obtained pre contrast and 20sec after the application of contrast agent. Examinations were performed at three different time points for injection of three dosages of CA (Gadobutrol, Bayer Healthcare): (1) 0.1 mmol/kg body weight (BW), (2) 0.05 mmol/kg BW and (3) 0.025 mmol/kg BW. Contrast ratios (CR) were measured pre and post contrast in the aorta and both renal arteries in correlation to adjacent psoas major muscle. Qualitative analysis with regard to delineation of the pre-contrast and post-contrast renal arterial vasculature was performed by two radiologists using a five-point-scale (5=excellent to 1= non diagnostic). Results: Non-enhanced T1w MRI provided an inherently high signal intensity of vasculature, yielding a good overall pre-contrast arterial delineation (mean 3.65). The application of contrast agent showed improved vessel delineation in qualitative and quantitative analysis for all three dosages, yielding comparable results in subjective ratings of qualitative analysis (mean0.025Gd 4.55; mean0.05Gd 4.50; mean0.1Gd mean 4.60). Quantitative analysis of contrast ratios showed only minor increase of mean values with increasing Gadolinium dosage (mean0.025Gd 0.08; mean0.05Gd 0.15; mean0.1Gd mean 0.18). Conclusion: 7T CE-MRA allows for a significant dose reduction to one-quarter while maintaining high image quality.",

Bonaffini, L. Longoni, A. Sala, A. Rovelli, S. Sironi;  Monza/IT (dr.masetto@gmail.com)    Purpose: To assess the diagnostic value of MRI in detecting and monitoring post-treatment osteonecrotic lesions in paediatric patients with lymphoproliferative disease. Methods and Materials: 109 patients (60 males, mean age 12 years) with lymphoproliferative disease treated with chemotherapy (71) or bone marrow transplant (38), and with clinical suspicion of lower limbs osteonecrosis, underwent a lowerlimb MRI examination between November 2006 and August 2012. The study was performed on a 1.5 T scanner (Philips, Achieva), acquiring short tau inversion recovery (STIR) long TE and T1-weighted sequences in the coronal plane from the hips to the ankles, with an average acquisition time of 18 minutes. Additional sequences were performed in selected cases (e.g. restaging known osteonecrosis of the hip with articular deformity). Results: On the baseline or follow-up MRI, 72/109 patients showed osteonecrosis, with a total of 424 lesions (5 hips, 195 femurs, 19 patellae, 159 tibiae, 7 fibulae, 39 ankle and foot bones). 151/424 involved articular surface and 33 lesions had articular deformity. 58/109 patients had osteonecrosis on the baseline study: 35/58 underwent follow-up and 7 of them developed articular deformity. 51/109 patients did not show osteonecrosis at baseline examination and 15 of them developed at follow-up examination osteonecrotic lesions (4 with articular deformity). Moreover, 8 patients showed concomitant neoplastic lesions. Conclusion: Our MRI protocol proved to be quick and feasible in detecting and monitoring osteonecrosis in haematologic paediatric patients, impacting both their prognosis and their management in terms of treatment and follow-up.B-0597 11:24Painful paediatric hip: frog-leg lateral view only!

In group 2, the significant increase in objective noise compared to group 1 (48.37 HU; p < 0.0001): (a) hampered detection of acute PE in one patient and (b) altered detection of peripheral clots (12 false-negative and 2 false-positive results). Comparing group 3 Materials: This retrospective study included 100 consecutive patients (63 females, 28 to 97 years) who underwent CT-PA and DS-CT-P of the lung (Somatom Definition, Siemens, Forchheim, DE, 140 kV and 80 kV, collimation 64x1.2 mm; 100 ml Jopamiro 370, Bracco, IT, flow rate 5 ml/s, 50 ml NaCl) for the diagnosis of suspected PE. Two radiologists (A, B) blinded to patient information (except suspicious PE) independently analysed the CT-PA-data in random order twice, with and without DS-CT-P images. Both radiologists assessed CT-PA and DS-CT-P for image quality, presence of pulmonary emboli at main, lobar, segmental and sub-segmental arterial levels and perfusion defects, respectively. Confidence in PE diagnosis was scored on a 10-point scale.Results: PE was diagnosed in 21 and 22 patients by readers A and B, respectively, in concordance in 20 patients. There was no significant change in diagnostic confidence with additional DS-CT-P data analysis (A: 9.4 to 9.4; B: 9.0 to 9.6), B scored one study neg. for PE on CT-PE + DS-CT-P, which was pos. by CT-PA alone. Interobserver variability with kappa=0.882 (CT-PA) and 0.910 (CT-PA+DS-CT-P) for diagnosis of PE was excellent. Conclusion: DS-CT-P data do not improve diagnostic confidence in CT-PA diagnosis of acute PE, because low image quality in CT-PA parallels low image quality in DS-CT-P.

Methods and Materials: Retrospectively, 525 consecutive patients (326 male, mean age 59 years) over a period of 24 months were included in this study. All patients underwent a MSCT of the thorax (N=96), of the abdomen (N=101) or of thorax and abdomen (N=328) because of an clinical uncertain infection without obvious focus. Results: In 121 patients (23%) the clinical suspected diagnosis was approved, in 170 patients (32.4%) a diagnosis which had not been suspected was revealed and in 234 patients (44.6%) no infection focus could be located. Furthermore, in 169 cases (32.2%) the therapy was changed due to MSCT findings (surgery, percutaneous abscess drainage, change of antiobiosis), while in 356 cases (67.8%) therapy was held on. Conclusion: The findings of MSCT are of great relevance in the detection of obscure infection focuses and can constitute an important contribution in optimising the therapy.B-0726 11:33Impact and appropriateness of emergency department ultrasonography requests: a prospective study E.S. Ventura, Y. Costa, F.V. Gomes; Faro/PT (fvgomes@gmail.com) Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the appropriateness and clinical impact of Emergency Department ultrasonography requests in Hospital Central de Faro, Portugal. Methods and Materials: In this prospective study, ultrasonography examinations requested by the Pediatric and General Emergency Departments of Hospital Central de Faro, between 19 th and 26 th of March 2012 were evaluated. A description of the patient's demographic parameters and medical histories was undertaken with questionnaires and the consultation of the hospital database. Examinations were classified according to clinical impact and, based on the American College of Radiology Criteria and the Portuguese Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Geral de Sa\u00fade Guidelines, to appropriateness. Clinical impact of the examinations was correlated with emergency department's provisional diagnosis and appropriateness according to the guidelines. The associations were statistically analysed with the Chi-square independence test and Fisher exact test. Results: The vast majority of the ultrasonography examinations performed did not agree with the provisional diagnosis (73.6%) and a considerable number did not have any clinical impact (37.9%). According to the American College of Radiology and Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Geral de Sa\u00fade, 57.5% and 10.3% of the scans were inappropriate, respectively. Clinical impact of the ultrasound scans had a statistically significant (P < 0.05) association both with the appropriateness of the requests and with having a well-defined provisional diagnosis.Conclusion: The clinical impact of ultrasound examinations in the emergency department increases both by following the American College of Radiology and Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Geral de Sa\u00fade guidelines and also when a well-defined provisional diagnosis is suggested by the prescribing doctors.

Freiburg/DE, 2 Chicago, IL/US (julia.geiger@uniklinik-freiburg.de) Purpose: To characterise pulmonary and aortic blood flow alterations and their correlation to postsurgical anatomy in patients with transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) after arterial switch by 4D MRI. Methods and Materials: Flow-sensitive 4D MRI (venc=200 cm/s, spatial/temporal resolution ~ 2.5 mm\u00b3/38 ms) was performed in 17 D-TGA patients and 12 healthy controls (age=12\u00b15.4 vs. 23\u00b11.6 years). Patients were divided into two groups: anterior (n=10) and right anterior (n=7) position of the pulmonary trunk (TP) in relation to the ascending aorta (AAo). Blood flow was visualised by time-resolved 3D particle traces. Visual grading (ranking 0-2) of flow disturbances (vortices, helices) was performed. The flow ratio right and left pulmonary artery (RPA:LPA) and flow velocity were quantified at the valves and in the RPA and LPA. Results: Patients with anterior TP had increased TP vortices (6/10, mean grade 1.6) compared with right anterior TP position (1/7). Increased helices were seen in the LPA of both patient groups (9/17, grade 1.3), less frequent in the RPA (4) and TP (3). Systolic peak velocity in TP was significantly higher in patients (1.74m/ s\u00b10.63m/s vs. 0.95m/s\u00b10.12m/s in volunteers), in the RPA 2.04m/s\u00b10.43m/s vs. 0.98m/s\u00b10.14m/s, in the LPA 1.78m/s\u00b10.54m/s vs. 0.89m/s\u00b10.13m/s. The flow ratio RPA:LPA was more heterogenous in patients (RPA:LPA=1.56\u00b10.78 vs. 1.09\u00b10.15 in volunteers). 11 patients had increased helices in the AAo (grade 1.6). Conclusion: 4D flow evaluation of postsurgical blood flow in TGA patients revealed flow disturbances with frequent helices in the LPA and AAo and enhanced vortices for the haemodynamically unfavourable anterior TP position.

Adams, N. Wesseling, J.L.M. Strengers, W.B. de Vries, M.C. Molenschot; Utrecht/NL (a.adams@umcutrecht.nl)Purpose: To establish reference values for heart valve diameters, assessed by routine echocardiography, in a cohort of extreme preterm infants.Methods and Materials:Neonates under 32 weeks' gestation underwent routine echocardiography 24-72 hours after birth. Patients with evident congenital cardiac abnormalities were excluded. Heart valve diameters were retrospectively assessed in static images by measuring the maximal distance between hinge points at the level of the annulus. Measurements were performed by two investigators and repeated on another day. Diameters were then related to length, weight, body surface area (BSA), gestational age, and head circumference by linear regression. Results: A total of 198 infants (103 males) were included, with a median gestational age of 29.7 weeks (range 24.3-31.9), mean birth weight of 1.29\u00b10.40 kg (range 0.54-2.75), head circumference 27\u00b12.5 cm (range 21-39), and BSA 0.11\u00b10.02m 2 (range 0.06-0.18). Average valve diameters were 5.2\u00b10.6 mm for aortic valves (AV), 8.3\u00b11.1 mm for mitral valves (MV), 6.1\u00b10.8 mm for pulmonary valves (PV), and 7.9\u00b11.4 mm for tricuspid valves (TV), respectively.

Reichelt, J. Aissa, K. Rybacki, K.-G. Klein, G. Antoch, B. Turowski; D\u00fcsseldorf/DE (mathys@uni-duesseldorf.de)Purpose: To assess the prognostic relevance of perfusion CT (PCT) examinations in the early phase after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Methods and Materials: 312 patients were retrospectively interrogated with a questionnaire one year after spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was determined, respectively. Perfusion data from the early period of the disease were available for all patients. Results: MTT (mean transit time) values in the early period were significantly correlated (p \u00b2 0.001, r = 0.422) with the clinical long-term outcome (mRS). Corresponding to our linear regression analysis, MTT is the second most important regressor (behind WFNS grade, which is a measure for the clinical severity of the haemorrhage) for the prediction of the long-term mRS. An MTT value of 4.11 s could be identified as a threshold predicting an unfavourable long-term outcome (mRS \u00b3 2). An MTT value \u00b3 4.39 s indicated a poor long-term outcome (mRS 4 -6). Intraarterial spasmolysis with nimodipine (70 endovascular procedures in 51 of the included patients) could reduce the average MTT value by 0.89 s.Conclusion:The presented data corroborate the relevance of PCT data for clinical long-term results of SAH patients and may assist risk-benefit assessment in the planning of invasive procedures (e.g. intraarterial spasmolysis).B-0750 10:39Advanced MRI sequences in the acute evaluation of transient ischaemic attack (TIA).

Sommer;  Munich/DE (kolja.thierfelder@med.uni-muenchen.de)    Purpose: While flow-volume mismatch is being increasingly used in the selection of stroke patients for thrombolytic therapy, there is no consensus on the method of mismatch estimation. Our aim was to determine reliability and reproducibility of different ways of mismatch assessment in patients who underwent recently introduced whole brain CT perfusion. Methods and Materials: We included 27 consecutive stroke patients who underwent 128-row CTP with extended coverage of 10.0 cm in the z-axis. Two experienced readers assessed the extent of cerebral flow-volume mismatch (MM) twice and in three different ways: (1) visually estimated in steps of 10% (Est-MM), (2) performing a volumetric mismatch analysis using Osirix software (Vol-MM), and (3) using the 10-point Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS) scale for CTP (ASP-MM). Inter-and intrareader variabilities were determined by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Kappa values. Results: Est-MM showed poor interreader and moderate intrareader agreement (ICCs: 0.311/0.726). Vol-MM agreement was excellent in large (\u00b350 ml) perfusion deficits (ICCs: 0.962/0.986), while it was poor to moderate in small (< 50 ml) perfusion deficits (ICCs: 0.568/0.732). ASP-MM agreement was poor (Kappa: 0.343/0.540), but there was no case where ASP-MM points difference between readings was \u00b33. Using the information of Vol-MM would have substantially changed the mismatch estimation and lead to a reclassification in 4/27 cases in Est-MM and in 10/27 cases in ASP-MM. Conclusion: Volumetric mismatch assessment can improve the evaluation of whole brain CT perfusion maps, especially in patients with large perfusion deficits. It might serve for a better selection of stroke patients who may profit by thrombolytic therapy.B-0758 11:42Influence of temporal sampling rate of CTP acquisitions on cerebral perfusion maps using a digital phantom M.

Bourdet, M. Hammadouche, J.-l. Drap\u00e9; Paris/FR (kn638@yahoo.fr)Purpose: The Lequesne's false profile (LFP) view is commonly used to evaluate hip joint space narrowing (JSN) and anterior acetabular coverage using the verticalcenter-anterior margin (VCA) angle. A novel low-dose biplanar slot scanner (SS) allows simultaneous acquisitions of weight-bearing oblique views of both hip joints. The aim was to compare LFP views versus biplanar oblique views obtained by SS. Methods and Materials: LFP views were obtained on 56 hips on a computed radiography system. On the same hips, simultaneous oblique views of both hips were acquired in the SS, with the patient's pelvis positioned at 45\u00b0 from each acquisition plane. Two independent observers measured VCA angle and JSN on each acquisition. JSN was evaluated through the joint space/femoral head diameter ratio. Measurements from both techniques were compared using the student t-test and the Pearson's correlation coefficient. Interobserver agreement of VCA angle and JSN assessments were calculated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: VCA angle was 33.5\u00b0 (SD = 6.2\u00b0) with SS and 35\u00b0 (5.6\u00b0) with LFP views (p < 0.05). Pearson correlation coefficient between two techniques was 0.78 (p < 0.01). JSN was 0.114 (SD = 0.03\u00b0) with SS and 0.108 (SD = 0.03\u00b0) with LFP views (p < 0.05). Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.85 (p < 0.01). ICCs for VCA angle were 0.91 with SS and 0.69 with LFP views. ICCs for JSN evaluation were 0.76 for both SS and LFP views. Conclusion: SS is a reliable, easy, and low-dose evaluation of JSN and VCA angle despite a slight angular positioning compared with LFP.B-0787 11:42Diagnostic value of MR enterography (MRE), after oral administration of glucose-polyethylene, in the determination of the activity of disease in patients with known Crohn's disease: a prospective single centre study V. Bartolo, D. Ippolito, C. Trattenero, P.A. Bonaffini, V. Besostri, S. Sironi; Monza/IT (bartolo.valentina@yahoo.it)    Purpose: To evaluate the role of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) after oral administration of isotonic glucose-polyethylene glycol (PEG) in monitoring disease activity in Crohn's disease (CD). Methods and Materials: Forty-eight patients (M 32, mean age 43) with histological diagnosis of CD and suspicion of recurrence based on clinical data and CD activity index (CDAI) underwent an MRE study 45 minutes after the oral administration of 1.5-2 litres of PEG, on 1.5 T magnet and using a surface phased-array body coil. The study protocol included axial and coronal T1-weighted, sSShT2 and sBTFE sequences and dynamic contrast-enhanced THRIVE. The intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations of disease were evaluated by two radiologists blinded to clinical and pathological findings, analysing: the degree of bowel distention, wall thickening and enhancement, lymph-node enlargement, stranding of fat tissue, presence of fistulas or abscesses. Results: Oral administration of PEG solution was well tolerated by patients, without major complications (moderate diarrhoea in 4 patients). A good relaxation of the small intestine was obtained in 44 patients (91%). The MRE study showed recurrence in 37 patients (77%) as mural enhancement in 36 cases (74%), layered enhancement in 24 (50%), comb sign in 14 (29%), stranding of fat tissue in 10 (20%), mesenteric node involvement with intense enhancement in 18 (37%) and extra-intestinal manifestations (fistulas and sclerosing cholangitis) in 14 (29%).",

NASC had significant higher mean \u03bb1, \u03bb2 and ADC values than NWM. Lesions had significantly higher \u03bb2, \u03bb3 and lower FA values than NASC. Lesions were higher in \u03bb1, \u03bb2 and ADC with a lower FA than NWN, without anterior ROIs. FA changes between NASC and lesions correlated with \u03bb2 and \u03bb3. FA in NASC and NWM show correlation with \u03bb1, \u03bb2 and \u03bb3. Clinical parameters did not correlate. Conclusion: NASC shows an increased longitudinal and transverse diffusivity compared to NWM. In lesions, the transverse diffusivity is increased, reducing FA. NASC shows both axonal and myelin-related damage while for a focal lesion it is the myelin damage that has increased significantly.Purpose: Cognitive deficits occur in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), which represents the earliest clinical stage of multiple sclerosis (MS), but their pathophysiology remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between hemodynamic measurements and memory function in patients with CIS and relapsing remitting-multiple sclerosis (RR-MS).Methods and Materials:Thirty patients with CIS, thirty RR-MS patients and forty-three healthy subjects, matched for age, gender, education level, and FSIQ, were administered tests of short-term and working memory for digits, passages and geometric patterns. Using the dynamic susceptibility contrast-MRI (DSC-MRI) technique, cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit time (MTT) values were estimated in twenty cerebral regions of interest, placed in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal deep gray matter (NDGM) structures, bilaterally. Results: Both CIS and RR-MS groups showed significantly impaired scores on verbal working memory and secondary verbal memory. In CIS patients, globally elevated CBV and MTT values were detected, while their memory performance correlated inversely with CBV values in the left frontal NAWM, right thalamus, right caudate and corpus callosum, brain structures known to be involved in cognitive function.In contrast, among RR-MS patients, correlations of CBV values with memory indices were positive in the right frontal and periventricular NAWM and in the caudate. Conclusion: As the hemodynamic changes, detected in CIS, are indicative of inflammation, the observed cognitive disturbances may relate to widespread brain inflammatory processes that prevail in early MS.",

Methods and Materials: This retrospective study was IRB approved and informed consent was waived. Forty patients with 42 surgically confirmed HCCs underwent maps showing perfusion of enhancing tumours and quantitative ADC maps. After placing regions of interests (ROIs) on the site of maps which best corresponded to the enhanced regions of lesion, the following parameters were calculated: relative enhancement, maximum enhancement, maximum relative enhancement, time to peak and ADC values. Correlation between MR imaging, parametric values and clinical pathological classification was statistically analysed. Results: Sixteen out of 54 patients had residual disease and values of parameters measured within residual tumour tissue were: REA 44.66, VE 60.50, RLE 52.This feasibility study shows that quantitative multiparametric MR images analysis could provide an in vivo marker of biological characteristics of HCC useful in assessing the therapeutic treatment response.",

VCTP imaging was performed in 11 patients who underwent TACE of HCC. VCTP imaging of the HCC was performed on the day before TACE and 5 -7 days after TACE to assess early changes. All VCTP studies were performed on a 320 channel CT scanner (Aquilion One, Toshiba Medical Systems) and perfusion of the HCC was calculated using commercial body perfusion software (Toshiba Medical Systems). VCTP imaging is a non-invasive technique for evaluation of the early changes of HCC after TACE and may be used as imaging tool to assess early response. Especially the HAFF may be an accurate parameter for assessment of early response. CNRn at 80 kV was at least 8% lower for the conventional detector at all dose settings. Electronic noise became dominant at 60 mAs and CNRn decreased by another 35% at 15 mAs with increasingly prominent artefacts. For the Stellar detector CNRn did not decrease by more than 5% down to 15 mAs and there were no relevant image artefacts. Using 80 kV the same CNR of the clinical default setting (100 kV, 120 mAs) was obtained at 65% of the dose.Conclusion:The Stellar detector allows the routine use of 80 kV for abdominal perfusion imaging. For identical CNR this reduces the dose by 35% compared to 100 kV.Performance of a next-generation solid-state detector with fully integrated readout electronics for MDCT: quantitative analysis of image quality and radiation exposure reduction potential in comparison with its predecessor G.

Accumulation of virus-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes in the liver is promoted by platelets. To assess the effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy in hepato-carcinogenesis prevention we used preclinical liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a mouse model of CHB. The datasets reconstructed using SAFIRE reached at least the low-contrast performance of the datasets reconstructed with FBP at a relative dose of 50%. The use of SAFIRE led to a shift of noise granularity towards a coarser image noise while higher dose levels showed a shift towards finer noise.Conclusion: The use of SAFIRE improves low-contrast detectability when compared with FBP allowing for a dose reduction of approximately 50% without compromising low-contrast detectability or spatial resolution. The unfamiliar imaging appearance of iteratively reconstructed datasets may in part be explained by a different, coarser noise characteristic.

Readers found improvements in image quality and subjective image noise in IC detector-acquired images compared with the DC detector in the largest phantom, regardless of reconstruction algorithm. Objective image noise was also significantly (P < 0.001) reduced for the largest phantom. A noise reduction of up to 44.5% was achieved for the IC detector when scanned with 75 mAs and reconstructed with IR as compared with DC detector-acquired images. In patients, noise was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by on average 6.4% with the IC detector. A significant correlation was found between noise and abdominal diameter in DC detector images (r=0.604, P=0.005), whereas no such correlation was found for the IC detector (P=0.060).

Results: 10% fMTF value in XY-plane was 0.71\u00b10.01 lp/mm for the MSCT whereas for the CBCT it was 1.82\u00b10.12 lp/mm.

Cortines; Vicente L\u00f3pez/AR(javiervallejos@diagnosticomaipu.com.ar)    Purpose: The aim of this study was to demonstrate that there are significant differences in diameter and area in the descending aorta in the different phases of the cardiac cycle. Methods and Materials: Twenty-five patients who had an indication of CTA were evaluated with a multidetector 256-slice CT. Two phases were scanned in systole and diastole so as to perform measurements in both. Measurements were done a t 1 cm, 4 cm and 8 cm from the left subclavian artery. Differences between systole and diastole were calculated at different levels using Student\u00b4s T test. Measurements of the descending aorta at 4 cm from the left subclavian artery showed statistically significant differences between systole and diastole. The largest diameters of the aorta are the ones of the systolic phase. The systolic phase is the appropriate phase to determine the aortic diameters. Mismatch between prosthesis area and AoA area detected by MDCT is a better predictor of PVR as compared to echocardiography mismatch. Specific MDCT-based sizing recommendations should be developed.Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy and time-effectiveness of semi-automated model-based annulus computation compared with manual planimetry for assessment of aortic annulus dimensions prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).Methods and Materials:Retrospectively ECG-gated dual-source cardiac CT data of 50 consecutive TAVR candidates (82.5\u00b15.8 years) were included. Data were reconstructed at 300 ms past the R-peak and were analysed using an automatic 3D aortic valve model, fitted to CT-data by discriminative learning methods and incremental search. It contains the aortic root's surface, commissures and hinges and allows for automated morphologic identification of the annulus plane, defined by the most basal hinge points of the aortic cusp. Manual planimetric measurement using multiplanar reformations was used as the reference standard. Data were analysed using linear regression and Bland-Altman plots. Semi-automated morphologic aortic annulus quantification derived from an aortic valve model enables fast and accurate procedural planning in excellent agreement with manual planimetry and has the potential to improve cardiac imaging workflow in the evaluation of patients prior to TAVR. LVOT was measured in systole and diastole using multiplanar reconstruction of the preoperative MSCT data. The \u03b1LV-LVOT was correlated to occurrence of the PL, to the procedure duration and postoperative CK-MB levels. All measurements were performed by two experienced radiologists to calculate interobserver variability. Results: Cardiac CT was available in 75 patients (age 81.9\u00b15.8 years, 71% female). The mean \u03b1LV-LVOT was 61.8\u00b19.8\u00b0 and 61.3\u00b110.1\u00b0 in systole and diastole, respectively, without a significant change during the cardiac cycle. Paravalvular leakage was found in a total of 35 patients (I\u00b0=29 /38.7%, II\u00b0=6 /8%, III\u00b0=0). Patients with relevant (\u00b3II\u00b0) paravalvular leakage showed significantly steeper mean \u03b1LV-LVOT than patients without or I\u00b0 paravalvular leakage (Mean difference: 12.2\u00b0\u00b14.1\u00b0; p < 0.001). The \u03b1LV-LVOT was not associated with the prolonged procedural time nor the postoperative CK-MB levels (p=n.s). Conclusion: In TA-AVI the \u03b1LV-LVOT angle had a significant effect on the occurrence of paravalvular leakage. A steeper angle was associated with a significant higher grade of PL; thus, it might have a significant impact on the future design of valve stents and new delivery devices.Temporal dynamics of the aortic root and the aortic valve: implications for transcatheter aortic valve implantationT.

Different features are compared, and a method for the identification of an optimal feature set for discrimination of lung texture classes is proposed.Methods and Materials:The approach was evaluated on 97 HRCT images of pathological lung tissue. Slice thickness was 1 mm and inter-slice distance 10 mm. Regions of normal and four pathologic patterns (emphysema, ground glass, fibrosis, micronodules) were annotated by two radiologists. We extracted sets of texture features (Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Haralick features, wavelets, textons) and evaluated the classification performance on voxel level and region level with a tenfold cross validation. A Random Forest classifier was used as classifier, and corresponding feature importances served as feature selection criterion. Results: On voxel level Haralick features performed best with 69.59% classification accuracy (chance level: 20%). On region level LBPs reached the highest classification performance of 77.45%. The most discriminative features of the texture classes are intensity histogram values in the range between -1024 and -800 HU. Conclusion: Experiments reveal that LBPs on region level outperform classical and computationally more complex co-occurrence matrices. Furthermore, intensity is an essential feature for description of ILD-related textures. In general region-level features outperform voxel-level features. prognosis and treatment of NET patients are primarily based on SSTR expression and PET/CT. Therefore objective quantifications of scoring methods and correlations between PET/CT uptake values and SSTR expression in biopsies are needed. A method for such quantifications is introduced. Methods and Materials: Automated image analysis is used for the detailed quantification of SSTR expression in each virtual slide from NET biopsies of 30 patients by using Definiens software. Tumour regions are separated from nontumour regions and staining intensity is calculated. Cells, nuclei and membranes are segmented and classified. The results are correlated with SSTR expression scoring calculated by visual inspection. All the previous data are correlated with corresponding PET/CT uptake values. Automated image analysis is used to quantify correlations between patient data of in vivo and in vitro modalities like PET/CT and SSTR expression. These results are very promising and quantitatively support our hypothesis of a \"strong correlation\" between SSTR stained biopsy tissue and PET/CT uptake values.

Ablations were performed under ultrasound guidance with the patients under general anaesthesia. 3 needles were placed around the tumour, ablations performed according to the inbuilt software in the IRE generator and the needles then replaced until the entire tumour area had been covered. Results: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) the day after the ablation showed ablation zones in the tumour area, size 2.5-4 cm in diameter. The average postoperative stay was 10 days. 8 of the patients initially had pain at the treatment site but only post-ablation inflammation could be seen on CT. 3 patients developed a pancreatitis with elevated serum amylase. No other serious complications were noted and check-up with CT and CEUS 1 month after the treatments showed no adverse effects.

Napoli, G. Cartocci, G. Brachetti, L. DI Mare, F. Boni, V. Noce,  L. Bertaccini, C. Catalano; Rome/IT (napoli.alessandro@gmail.com)    Purpose: To evaluate safety and effectiveness of non-invasive high-intensity MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment for tumour control of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Methods and Materials: 5 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer underwent MRgFUS treatment using the ExAblate 2100 system (InSightec). Treatments were done in a single session, in an ambulatory setting. To evaluate tumour control, perfusion T1w-images after administration of gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance; Bracco, Milan, Italy) were obtained pre-and post-treatment in order to determine the non-perfused sonication-related area. Follow-up examinations were scheduled at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. After treatment, all patients underwent CHT with the same chemotherapy scheme. Results: All patients well tolerated the treatment and no heating-related adverse event was recorded during this clinical application. Immediately after treatment all patients showed coagulative necrosis with a mean non-perfused volume of 65.4\u00b116.6 [45 -90]. All patients showed a significative decrease of pain due to cancer infiltration. At follow-up tumour recurrence in treatment site was MRI evident but no local progression were recorded. After MRgFUS 2 patients underwent RT meanwhile one patients required another MRgFUS treatment. Conclusion: Our preliminary clinical experience indicates that focused ultrasound under MR guidance could be a promising non-invasive treatment modality to obtain a reduction of tumour size in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma not suitable for surgery. and has lower dose. Study with large sample size is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.Image-guided percutaneous thermal ablation of hepatic and renaltumours using high-frequency jet ventilation to minimise respiratory motion D.M.L. Tse, D.Y.F. Chung, S. Scott, P. Boardman, F.V. Gleeson, E.M. Anderson; Oxford/UK (donald.tse@gmail.com) Purpose: High-frequency jet ventilation minimises respiratory motion during general anaesthesia (GA-HFJV). We report our 5-year experience with GA-HFJV in thermal ablation of hepatic and renal tumours, and evaluate the procedural time, rates of technical success and complications. Methods and Materials: Between November 2007 and September 2012, 76 patients (24 females and 52 males, mean 69.6years) underwent 107 sessions of radiofrequency (RF) or microwave (MW) ablation. Tumour size, time under anaesthesia, ablation time, technical success and complications were recorded. Procedural time was calculated by subtracting ablation time from time under anaesthesia. 123) for ablations of renal lesions.There is no significant difference in procedural time between CT-guided alone and combined CT and USguided ablations of single hepatic lesions (p=0.27). Technical success was achieved in all sessions. No major complications were observed. Minor complications in 15 sessions (14%) included 4 cases of immediate peri-hepatic haematoma, 3 cases of haemothorax, none requiring further treatment. Conclusion: GA-HFJV is a safe technique which reliably minimises respiratory motion. This facilitates the procedure directly by producing ideal target immobilisation, which may reduce procedural time particularly for small or anatomically challenging lesions in the liver or kidney.Radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with chronic liver disease without cirrhosis: long-term experience L. Sottocornola, A. Salmi, A. Rossini, R. Maroldi, P. Cabassa; Brescia/IT(lara.sottocornola@gmail.com)    Purpose: This study aimed at determining the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic liver disease without cirrhosis. Methods and Materials: From the database of HCC treated by RF ablation in two referring centres 56 HCCs were found in 49 patients (age range, 62-90 years) with chronic liver disease (mainly HCV) without cirrhosis. The mean lesion diameter was 24.6 mm (range, 10-50 mm). Patients were treated percutaneously or by laparoscopic approach. Follow-up was performed by CT at 1, 4, and 6 months and every 6 months after that. Cumulative survival and disease-free survival rates of patients were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Any complications during follow-up were reported. Results: Cumulative survival rates were 100%, 82%, and 59% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Median survival time was 49 months (range, 1-120 months). Maximum tumour diameter was associated with the probability of survival. During follow-up 7 (14%) out 49 patients developed new nodules. Median disease-free survival rates were 96%, at 1 year and 93% at 2 and 3 years. No major complication occurred. Conclusion: Radiofrequency ablation of HCCs in patients without cirrhosis shows long-term survival rates and a low recurrence rate.Safety and efficacy of sonographically guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of left lobe hepatocellular carcinoma M.I.M.A. Ibrahim; Sohag/EG (mandw20022002@hotmail.com) Purpose: To assess the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of left lobe hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods and Materials: We performed a retrospective analysis of 157 patients who underwent percutaneous ultrasound-guided RFA for treatment of HCC. Forty-eight HCCs in left lobe were compared with 152 HCCs in right lobe. Patients underwent regular computed tomography imaging of the liver during follow-up and the treatment effectiveness and safety were evaluated. Incomplete ablation, recurrence, complications, and mortality were documented.Purpose: To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters that contribute the most in differentiation of benign vs. malignant soft tissue musculoskeletal tumours. Methods and Materials: Prospectively, 100 consecutive patients (53 males, 47 females, median age 51 years) with a musculoskeletal soft-tissue mass underwent magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 T,GE). Fifteen MRI parameters were evaluated for making a radiologic diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for imaging parameters predictive for malignancy. Histopathology was correlated with radiologic diagnosis in all patients. Results: There were 70 benign lesions (53 benign tumours and 17 tumour-like lesions) and 30 malignant lesions (26 malignant tumours and 4 metastases). Radiological diagnosis for primary malignant tumour was established in a total of 33 lesions, of which 24 (72.7%) had histological confirmation for primary malignant tumours. Nine cases (9%) were false-positive (4 benign tumours, one tumour-like lesion and 4 metastases) and two (2%) were false-negative. Radiological diagnosis for benign and malignant tumours showed identical sensitivity of 92.5% and 92.3%. High specificity of 95.7% was found in benign tumours. Global accuracy in determining the presence of benign tumour was 94% and of primary malignant tumour 89%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following MRI parameters to be independent significant predictive for primary malignant tumour: extracompartmental location, presence of peritumoural oedema, inhomogeneous signal on T2 WI. After i.v. application of contrast agent, peripheral and inhomogeneous enhancement significantly more often pointed to malignant tumour. Conclusion: A combination of individual MR imaging parameters improved radiologic imaging diagnosis in differentiation between benign and malignant soft-tissue musculoskeletal lesions.Evaluation of features and role of ultrasound and MR imaging in large lipomas and well-differentiated liposarcomasH. Gupta 1 , V. Bhat 2 , S. Edward 1 , E. Hensor 1 , P. Robinson 1 ; 1 Leeds/UK, 2 Cardiff/UK (harun.gupta@nhs.net) Purpose: To review surgically proven well-differentiated liposarcomas and large lipomas for significantly different imaging or clinical features. Methods and Materials: Retrospective review of surgically treated extremity/ truncal lipomas and well-differentiated liposarcomas. 3 groups identified: lipomas imaged by ultrasound and MRI, lipomas imaged by ultrasound only (size \u00b35 cm), well-differentiated liposarcoma by ultrasound and/or MRI. Imaging was independently evaluated by 2 radiologists blinded to history and case proportion. Ultrasound scored for location, depth, size, shape, echogenicity, homogenicity, septation and Doppler flow. MRI scored for location, depth, size, margins, signal characteristics, fat suppression, septation, non-adipose areas, nodules and contrast enhancement. Fischer's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed.Results: 114 lipomas (70 \u00b35 cm US only; 44 US and MRI irrespective of size) and 27 liposarcomas were evaluated. Majority of lipomas were subcutaneous. Majority of liposarcomas were lower limb (sensitivity 88%, specificity 75%). Median lipoma volume was significantly smaller than liposarcoma (58.5 vs 201 mm3). No significant difference in other ultrasound criteria was found. Fat suppression was complete in 91% lipomas but only 31% liposarcomas. For liposarcomas nodular areas were moderately specific [65.9%] and sensitive [80.8%] but non-adipose areas specific [93.2%] but not sensitive [42.3%]. Conclusion: 1. Lipomas can be large and size criteria (> 5 cm) for specialist referral is inefficient for those with typical benign imaging appearances. A size > 7 cm may be more effective in such cases. 2. Ultrasound can effectively evaluate large B-0428 15:12 Fusion imaging-guided percutaneous biopsy of focal hepatic lesions with poor conspicuity on conventional ultrasonography H. Park, M. Lee, M. Kim, M. Lee, J. Hwang, T. Kang, S. Lim, H. Lim, H. Lim; Seoul/KR (mydr.kim@gmail.com)    Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of real-time US and CT/MR image fusion, for percutaneous US-guided biopsy of focal hepatic lesions with poor sonographic conspicuity. Methods and Materials: This study was conducted as a retrospective analysis of a prospective database, and was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Patients who had target lesions with poor conspicuity on B-mode US for percutaneous biopsy were enrolled in the study. Lesion conspicuity was assessed using conventional B-mode US first, and then using fusion imaging later in the same session. We compared lesion conspicuity and detection rates between B-mode US and fusion imaging and evaluated how many cases of initially invisible lesions on B-mode US became visible after image fusion. The technical success rate was evaluated based on the final diagnoses, which were established by pathological examination of the biopsy specimen as well as through clinical and radiological follow-up examination. Results: A total of 22 patients were enrolled in this study. After image fusion, lesion conspicuity was increased in 63.6% (14/22) of focal hepatic lesions. Moreover, 66.7% (6/9) of lesions which were invisible through B-mode US became visible after image fusion. The true positive detection rate was significantly different between B-mode US and fusion imaging (9/22 vs. 19/22, p=0.0044). Percutaneous biopsy was performed for all lesions, including 3 target lesions which were invisible even after image fusion. The technical success rate was 95.5% (21/22).Conclusion:The fusion imaging technique is effective for percutaneous biopsy of focal hepatic lesions with poor sonographic conspicuity.CTNAV: a prospective randomised clinical trial of a navigation system for computer assisted CT guided interventions P.

Woertler 1 ; 1 Munich/DE, 2 Erlangen/DE (pia.jungmann@tum.de)    Purpose: To evaluate the reduction of metallic artefacts produced by orthopaedic tumour prostheses in MR imaging by application of new WARP-sequences (VAT and SEMAC). Methods and Materials: WARP turbo-spin-echo sequences and standard metal sequences were evaluated by scanning tumour-prostheses in an experimental model at 1.5 T MRI. Three different MR techniques were applied: (i) standard, (ii) VAT and (iii) combined VAT and SEMAC sequences (VAT&SEMAC). For each technique, coronal short-tau-inversion-recovery (STIR), coronal T1-weighted and axial T1-and T2-weighted sequences were assessed. Diameters of artefacts were measured quantitatively at n=8 different standardised spots for n=4 different tumour prostheses and real diameters of prostheses were compared with artefacts. Wilcoxon and paired t-test were used for statistical analysis. Results: Reduction of artefacts was achieved by application of WARP-techniques. For coronal STIR-sequences, diameters were smaller in the VAT&SEMAC group (Mean\u00b1standard deviation, 70.1\u00b192.9 mm) compared with standard sequences (73.0\u00b192.6 mm; Wilcoxon-test, P < 0.001). The VAT group showed intermediate diameters (72.0\u00b193.1 mm; P=0.002). Compared with standard coronal T1-weighted sequences (70.1\u00b191.8 mm), application of VAT (68.3\u00b191.1 mm; P=0.005) and VAT&SEMAC (68.2\u00b191.0 mm; P=0.002) showed similar artefact reduction. Accordingly, axial VAT also reduced artefacts (T2-weighted, P=0.008; T1-weighted, P=0.006). However, real diameters (27.2\u00b118.2 mm) were significantly smaller than artefact diameters for all techniques (Standard STIR, 32.5\u00b121.4 mm; VAT, 30.7\u00b121.3 mm; VAT&SEMAC, 29.5\u00b120.3 mm; all P < 0.05). Conclusion: In the experimental model, significant reduction of metallic artefacts was achieved by application of WARP-techniques (VAT and SEMAC) for all pulse sequences. Thus, this new technique appears to be applicable to postoperative follow-up of patients with orthopaedic tumour prostheses.Author Disclosures: M.

De Schepper, S. Ceyssens, D.H. Creytens, J. Somville, P. Van Dyck, P. Pauwels, M. Peeters, P.M. Parizel; Antwerp/BE (jan.gielen@uza.be)Purpose: To compare the efficacy of surgical-, CT-and PET-CT-guided biopsy of musculoskeletal (pseudo)tumours. Methods and Materials: Between January 2011 and July 2012, we biopsied156 musculoskeletal lesions. A new PET-CT guidance technique, targeting the area of most intense radio-labelling (AMIR), is introduced. We included 149 lesions, 36 soft tissue lesions (STL) and 113 bone lesions (BL). All patients were randomly distributed over the surgical-or CT-guided biopsy systems: CT (n68), PET-CT (n40), surgical (n41). In each case, appropriate biopsy needles were used. Results: Correct characterisation was obtained in 80.5%, 88.2% and 92.5% of surgical-, CT-, and PET-CT-guided techniques, Fisher's exact test: P=0.2756. Overall efficacy of characterisation was 88% in benign and 86% in malignant lesions, Chi-squared test X 2 = 0.1367, df=1, P=0.7116. In STL, correct characterisation was obtained in 80% (surgical), 77.8% (CT) and 88.2% (PET-CT). In BL, correct characterisation was obtained in 80.6% (surgical), 89.8% (CT) and 95.7% (PET-CT), Fisher's exact test, P=0.7329 and 0.2974, respectively. Conclusion: The diagnostic efficacy of PET-CT was better, compared to surgicaland CT-guided biopsy. The efficacy rates for malignant and benign lesions, for the three techniques, were comparable. The best results were obtained in BL with CT and PET-CT techniques. Although the differences are not statistically significant, (false results are too few to find statistically significant differences), it appears that the information provided by PET for CT-guided biopsy is useful, thereby reducing the false negative rate from 19.4% to 4.3% in BL and from 20% to 11.8% in STL.CT evaluation of thoracic bone metastasis: comparison of 3D volume-rendered images and combined axial and coronal multiplanar reconstruction imagesK. Doo 1 , E.-Y. Kang 1 , H. Yong 1 , O. Woo 1 , K. Lee 2 , Y.-W. Oh 1 ; 1 Seoul/KR, 2 Ansan/KR (kwdoo@korea.ac.kr)Purpose: Although a correct assessment of thoracic bone metastasis is important, it is time-consuming and insensitive by conventional axial and coronal CT images. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic benefits of 3D volumerendered (VR) images for the detection of thoracic bone metastasis on CT as compared with combined axial and coronal multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images. Methods and Materials: Among 117 consecutive patients who underwent chest CT and PET-CT or bone scan, 21 patients who had thoracic bone metastasis were included. Two radiologists independently reviewed the probability of metastasis of ribs and vertebrae on combined axial and coronal MPR, 3D VR, and 3D VR with MPR images. Diagnosis of bone metastasis was determined by PET-CT, bone scan, or biopsy. Diagnostic performance parameters and interpretation time were evaluated. Results: For all thoracic metastasis (195/756), the mean sensitivity and accuracy of 3D VR with MPR and MPR images were similar (reader 1, 62.1%, 88.6% vs 52.8%, 91%; reader 2, 50.3%, 86% vs 48.7%, 85.6%, P> 0.05). For rib metastasis, the mean sensitivity and accuracy of 3D VR with MPR were higher than those of MPR images (reader 1, 64.1%, 92.7% vs 48.5%, 89.5%.; reader 2, 52.4%, 88.9% vs 42.7%, 87.5%, P < 0.05). The mean interpretation time was decreased on 3D VR with MPR compared to MPR images (reader 1, 73.6 vs 122.5, reader 2, 103.4 vs 182.5 seconds, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The addition of 3D VR to MPR images performs significantly better feasibility than combined axial and coronal MPR images for rapid evaluation of thoracic bone metastasis.DCE-MRI for assessment of vessel remodelling associated with bone defect healing in experimental lytic bone metastasesD.

Sironi;  Monza/IT (pa.bonaffini@gmail.com)    Purpose: To assess the diagnostic value of ADC maps in the evaluation of response to chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Methods and Materials: 25 patients with MM underwent a 1.5 T WB-MRI (Achieva, Philips), before and 4-6 months after chemotherapy, with the following protocol: coronal and sagittal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) T2 and T1 TSE and axial DWIBS (b values: 0, 500, 1000 mm2/sec). DWIBS were compared with T1 and STIR sequences in five districts (skull, spine, sternum and ribs, pelvis, upper and lower limbs) to evaluate response to treatment. On ADC maps ROI were drawn along contours of bone lesions. The absolute values and percentage variation of ADC (\u0394ADC) before (MR1) and after (MR2) chemotherapy were calculated and compared between responders and non-responders patients. Results: 30 lesions (12 focal, 18 diffuse) were evaluated and correctly detected on DWIBS as areas with high signal intensity as compared to normal bone marrow; response to chemotherapy was established as signal intensity decrease after treatment. The mean ADC values were: 0.WB-MRI is a non-invasive tool able to evaluate response to treatment in patients with MM, by determining individual changes of ADC values, related to biological changes in tumour tissue.Presence/absence of hepatic steatosis after percutaneous intraportal pancreatic islet transplantation in 108 allo-and auto-transplanted patients: can ultrasound predict the clinical outcome?

            "text": "). Results: The prevalence of vertebral fractures was 48%. Patients with fractures were not significantly older than patients without fractures (65 vs 62 years of average, p> 0.25). The trabecular vBMD in patients with fractures was significantly reduced from 200 mg/cc (SEM \u00b1 9.3) to 166 mg/cc (SEM \u00b1 9.6) (p < 0.05). In the age-adjusted logistic regression, the OR per SD for vBMD trab. was 1.9 (1.1-3.6). The OR for Tb.Sp. was 2.3 (1.3-4.0) per SD. In a model combining both parameters, Tb.Sp. remained significant without additional predictive value. Cortical parameters did not provide significant predictive value for fracture events. Conclusion: In MM patients, the loss of trabecular density is associated with the risk of vertebral fractures. The detection of increased trabecular separation as caused by plasmacell-infiltration appears to be of value for fracture risk assessment.Imaging patterns in multiple myeloma: observations at whole body MRI N.M. Long, O.M. Drumm, P. O' Gorman, S.J. Eustace; Dublin/IE (nevelong@gmail.com)Purpose: To categorise imaging patterns in multiple myeloma and correlate with patient demographics and outcome. Methods and Materials: 200 consecutive whole body MRI studies of patients with a proven diagnosis of multiple myeloma were included for review. Images were reviewed by 2 experienced radiologists with discrepancies resolved by consensus. In each case an attempt was made to characterise patterns of marrow infiltration. Correlation was subsequently performed with markers of disease activity including percentage plasma cells, LDH, immunological markers and Bence-Jones protein.Results: Four distinct patterns of marrow infiltration were identified in multiple myeloma. Pattern A: Normal marrow with superimposed plasmacytoma. Pattern B: Normal marrow with multiple superimposed plasmacytomata. Pattern C: Diffuse marrow infiltration/marrow packing. Pattern D: Diffuse marrow infiltration/marrow packing with superimposed plasmacytomata. Type A patients showed optimum outcome with improved treatment response and reduced early mortality. Marrow patterns type B, C and D correlated with progressively increasing disease severity with type D patients demonstrating the poorest treatment response and outcome. Conclusion: Four distinct patterns of marrow disease can be identified in patients with multiple myeloma and these should be evaluated at diagnosis as they ultimately dictate outcome and correlate with treatment response.Efficacy of whole body low-dose CT (WBLDCT) in the staging of patients with early multiple myeloma: comparison with whole body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI)V. Besostri, D. Ippolito, P.A. Bonaffini, A. Masetto, A. Cuccia, S. Sironi; Milan/IT (valeriabesostri@gmail.com) Purpose: To compare WBLDCT (whole body low dose CT) study with WBMRI (whole body magnetic resonance imaging) in the identification of bone marrow involvement for the detection of bone lesions and for risk evaluation of pathological fractures. Methods and Materials: A total of 25 patients with histologically confirmed myeloma underwent WBLDCT and WBMRI. Entire skeleton was divided into five districts (skull, spine, sternum and ribs, pelvis, upper and lower limbs) in terms of pattern, size and distribution of disease. Unenhanced WBLDCT was performed on 256-slice scanner (Philips, ICT, 256): voltage 120 KV, tube current time product 40 mAs, collimation 128x0.65. MRI protocol was performed on a 1.5 T (Achieva Philips) and consisted of T1 TSE and T2 STIR on coronal and sagittal plane and DWIBS on axial plane. WBLDCT findings were compared with those of WBMRI. The disease was staged according to Salmon and Durie System. Results: On WBMRI 9 patients showed no involvement; in 16 patients, 65 regions were affected by a total of 400 focal lesions: 14 patients were stage I, 4 were stage II and 6 were stage III. On WBLDCT 8 patients showed no involvement; in 17 patients, 49 regions were affected by a total of 396 focal bone lesions: 14 patients were stage I, 2 were stage II and 8 were stage III. WBLDCT overstaged 5 patients compared with MRI. The infiltration patterns were concordant in both techniques: focal in 9 patients, diffuse in 5 patients and combined in 10 patients; 1 patient showed no disease. Conclusion: WBLDCT is a fast and feasible technique for detecting small osteolytic lesions, but presents poor sensitivity for evaluation of abnormalities in early focal marrow infiltrations. Conversely, MRI protocol is more specific to assess low degrees of diffuse bone marrow infiltration.Liver fat volume fraction quantification in patients with chronic liver diseases with separated estimation of fat and water relaxation times at 1.5 and 3.0 T B.

The goal of this study is to compare the LFC values between MRS and in-phase/opposed-phase MRI in extremely obese patients. Methods and Materials: 30 obese patients (mean BMI 48 kg/m2) were imaged at 1.5 T. MR spectra were acquired in liver segments II, IV and VII. In-phase/ opposed-phase (IP/OP) MRI data were corrected for T1 and T2* effects and used to calculate LFC maps. To compare IP/OP MRI and MRS, regions of interests of the size of the MRS voxels were placed in the fat parameter map at positions that matched the location of the spectroscopic voxel. Tissue samples were taken for histopathological analysis. Results: Mean overall intrahepatic fat content from IP/OP imaging was 14.3 \u00b1 2.0%. Lipid content ranged from 0.2 to 35.7% with the IP/OP technique and from 0.0 to 71.2% with MRS. MRI and MRS values were characterised by an insignificant (p=0.36) bias of -3.6% and upper/lower limits of agreement of 3.8/-11.0%.",

MRI was performed in a 1.5 T system using a pre-clinical T2* corrected three-echo chemical shift-encoded sequence. Offline reconstruction of the PDFF (corrected for T1, T2* relaxation, noise bias, and multi-peak spectrum of fat) and the apparent R2* (fat corrected) were performed. PDFF and R2* were previously calibrated by histopathologically determined fat and hepatocellular iron content, respectively. PDFF and R2* were graduated in a 4-point scale system: no-, mild-, moderate-, and high content.Effect of Gd-EOB-DTPA on hepatic fat quantification using highspeed T2-corrected multiecho acquisition (HISTO) at 1H MR spectroscopy Y. Park 1 , C. Lee 1 , I. Kim 1 , B. Kiefer 2 , K. Kim 1 , J. Choi 1 , J. Lee 1 , C. Park 1 ; 1 Seoul/KR, 2 Erlangen/DE (pys797979@naver.com)    Purpose: To determine whether administration of Gd-EOB-DTPA affects hepatic fat quantification in a fast breath-hold high-speed T2-corrected multiecho acquisition (HISTO) MR spectroscopy. Methods and Materials: Sixty-two patients underwent 15-second breath-hold HISTO MR spectroscopy, which enables quantification of water and fat T2, and subsequently to provide corrected measure of hepatic fat fraction (FF). All patients performed HISTO twice before and after administration of Gd-EOB-DTPA, respectively. Post-contrast HISTO was performed between 2-minute equilibrium phase and 20-minute hepatobiliary phase. We evaluated variability of FF calculation during precontrast HISTO and post-contrast HISTO and effect of contrast material on mean FF calculation, using paired t test and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). We also evaluated whether effect of contrast material on mean FF calculation depends on FF level (FF< 5%, 5%\u00b2FF< 10%, 10%\u00b2FF), by comparing ICC using the z-test. Results: High reproducibility of FF calculation before and after contrast administration was observed (ICC=0.888 vs 0.885, respectively). Mean FF on pre-contrast HISTO was 5.06%\u00b12.90 and mean FF on post-contrast HISTO was 5.20%\u00b13.02. Mean FFs were not significantly different before and after administration of contrast agent (P=0.50). ICC for assessment of effect of administration of contrast agent was 0.848 (P < 0.001). ICC did not significantly change according toFF level  (ICC=0.353, 0.450, and 0.730, respectively; P=0.44). Conclusion: HISTO is known as a simple, accurate MR spectroscopic sequence of quantifying hepatic fat noninvasively. Gd-EOB-DTPA administration did not change the FF calculation of HISTO. HISTO after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration can be used for hepatic fat quantification, without spending time for additional MR sequence.Author Disclosures: I. Kim: Employee; Seimens. B.

Yousef; Cairo/EG  (naglaabdelrazek@yahoo.com)    Purpose: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by locoregional therapy and postoperative systemic chemotherapy is now an accepted strategy. More than 70% of patients achieve an objective response (including pathological complete remission in 10%-25% of cases), and many patients experience downstaging through primary chemotherapy. This study aimed to assess the complete pathological response by different imaging modalities including digital mammography, sonography, dynamic MRI, MRS and PET-CT. Methods and Materials: 125 female patients were enrolled in the study; all were histopathologically proven breast carcinoma and underwent full-course neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 25/125 showed complete pathological response indicated by histopathological examination of the surgical specimen.The pathological complete response was retrospectively evaluated by different imaging modalities done prior surgery including digital mammography, high-resolution breast sonography, dynamic MR mammography and MR spectroscopy as well as PET CT. In all patients, metallic clips werer lodged in the tumour prior neoadjuvant treatment and preoperative wire localisation was done to all the 25 cases showing complete pathological response. Results: Of 25 of 125 patients who showed complete pathological response, 14/25 has residual asymmetric density with or without microcalcifications by mammography. 17/25 patients showed complete disappearance of the lesion by sonography. Dynamic MRM showed complete change in the kinetics of the lesions from type 3 to type 1 and type 2a curves in 24/25 cases and MRS showed complete disappearance of the choline peak in 23/25 cases. PET CT shows absence of FDGB uptake in 21/25 cases. Conclusion: Dynamic MRM and MR proton spectroscopy offered good tools to monitor the response to chemotherapy and are the most sensitive indicators of complete pathological response even more sensitive than the PET CT.Breast MRI at 3 T: a pilot study estimating the role of unenhanced MRI (DWI combined with T2 IDEAL sequence) vs CE-MRI in the assessment of response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy F. Vasselli, F. Pediconi, M. Telesca, M. Luciani, V. Casali, E. Miglio, A. Castrignan\u00f2, C. Catalano; Rome/IT (federica.vasselli@gmail.com)Purpose: To assess the role of contrast-agent-free diagnostic approach combining DWI with ueMRI and compare the results with CE-MRM in the assessment of response to NAC using a 3 T Magnet. Methods and Materials: Consecutive patients undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for biopsy-proved breast cancer > 2 cm underwent MR at 3 T prior to chemotherapy and before surgical excision.MR protocol comprised an FSE-T2-IDEAL and DWI sequences and a Vibrant-3D-T1W sequence acquired before and after contrast media. Two blinded observers rated ueMRI and then CE-MRI for evaluation of tumour response. Lesion size, ADC values and FSE-IDEAL descriptors were assessed. Tumour size measurements on UE-MR were compared with those of CE-MR with statistic T-test. Response at MRI after chemotherapy were compared to histological specimen after surgery. Results: 31 patients were enrolled. Sensitivity of ueMRI was 92% (observer1) and 84% (observer2). Sensitivity of CE-MRI was 100% for both observers. Specificity was 82% (ueMRI) and 86% (CE-MRI) for both observers. The differences between methods and observers were not statistically significant (P\u00b30.09). Lesion size measurements did not differ significantly between all sequences. Lesion conspicuity was assessed quantitatively by measuring lesion Contrast/Noise Ratio (CNR). No statistically significant difference was observed between CNR of CE-MRI and DWI (p < 0.009) while CNR on T2 IDEAL was significantly lower respect to CE-MRI and DWI (> 0.009). Conclusion: Combination of DWI and T2 IDEAL have similar values of sensitivity and specificity of CE-MRI in the evaluation of tumour response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. ADC values could be useful for differentiating responders from non-responders earlier during the treatment.Early response monitoring of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients using magnetic resonance imaging: a systematic review M.

Methods and Materials: Pubmed, Cochrane library, Medline, and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies published until July 1, 2012. After primary selection, two reviewers independently assessed content of each eligible study using a standardised extraction form and pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: 35 eligible studies were selected. Correlation coefficients of residual tumour size assessed by MRI and pathology were good, with a median value of 0.698. Reported sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for predicting pCR with MRI ranged from 25 to 100%, 50 to 97%, 47 to 90%, and 44 to 100%, respectively. Both overestimation and underestimation were observed. MRI proved more accurate in determining residual disease than physical examination, mammography, and ultrasound. Recent studies suggest that diagnostic accuracy of MRI after neoadjuvant chemotherapy might be influenced by treatment regimen and breast cancer subtype. Conclusion: Breast MRI accuracy for assessing residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is good and probably surpasses other diagnostic means. However, both overestimation and underestimation of residual disease extent can be observed.",

            "text": "Breast MRI for assessment of primary systemic chemotherapy (PSC): computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) predicts degree of tissue response and residual tumour mass P.A.T. Baltzer 1 , M. Dietzel 2 , W.A. Kaiser 3 ; 1 Vienna/AT, 2 Erlangen/DE, 3 Jena/DEPurpose: Dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI (bMRI) is used for assessment of primary systemic chemotherapy (PSC), revealing functional information about tumour vasculature. Application of CAD systems to bMRI allows for volumetric enhancement pattern assessment. This study investigates the performance of CAD-assisted bMRI to assess the degree of tissue response to PSC and to identify residual tumour mass prior to surgery. Methods and Materials: bMRI examinations (1.5 T, according to EUSOMA recommendations) of 67 patients with biopsy proven invasive breast cancer lesions were examined before and after PSC. Maximum diameter reduction (D), lesion volume reduction (V) and most suspect enhancement curve (C) were obtained using a commercial available CAD system (CADstream). Histopathologic assessment of residual tumour mass (RT) and tumour tissue vitality (TV) was performed on open surgery specimen. Prediction of RT and TV by bMRI was analysed. Results: Before PSC, 108 malignant lesions were identified. After PSC 85 lesions remained. CAD revealed 108 lesions before and 48 lesions after PSC. Pathology showed no RT:44, reduced TV:53, TV not reduced: 11 cases. ROC-based accuracy for RT was highest for C and D (76.5% and 76.7%, respectively) whereas V showed lower diagnostic performance (70.7%). Regarding TV, accuracy was highest for V (85.7%), whereas C and D showed equal diagnostic use (80.9% and 81.7%, respectively). Conclusion: Our investigation shows that functional information both of curve type and size of enhancement are predictors of breast cancer response to PSC. Although bMRI is specific in the described setting, it shows only moderate sensitivity.Evaluation of residual breast tissue post-mastectomy using breast MRI V. Tsehmaister Abitbol, A. Rundstein, A. Shalmon, E. Konen, M. Sklair-Levy; Tel Hashomer/IL Purpose: To measure the residual breast tissue in patients who underwent mastectomy with implant reconstruction using breast MRI. Methods and Materials: Retrospective review of the breast MRI examinations performed at our institute between January and November 2011, in 45 women who had mastectomy with implant reconstruction. Residual breast thickness was evaluated at 4 points (3, 6, 9, 12 o'clock). Breast MRI was performed on 1.5 Tesla with a dedicated breast coil and a standard dynamic implant bilateral breast MRI protocol. Statistics included average, standard deviation, t-test and Kendall's Tau and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: 45 women were evaluated, the number of breasts evaluated was 88. Mean age was 43.6 (range 26-61years). We compared residual breast tissue post-mastectomy due to carcinoma (n= 45) vs. preventive mastectomy (n=43). The average width of residual breast tissue at 3, 6, 9, 12 o'clock was 8.8 mm,13.3 mm, 9.3 mm, and 13.3 mm, respectively. The mean width of residual breast tissue was smaller in the mastectomy due to carcinoma (10.63 mm) compared to preventive mastectomy (11.86 mm), the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.09). Conclusion: In women undergoing mastectomy either for breast carcinoma or prevention we have shown residual breast tissue measuring between 0 and 53.4 mm, with the maximum thickness at 12 o'clock.

Montemezzi;  Verona/IT (camera.lfmad@gmail.com)    Purpose: To describe the radiological appearance of normal and pathological findings resulting from mammary autologous fat injection (lipofilling).Methods and Materials:We retrospectively reviewed all the patients who undergone breast lipofilling at our Institution from January 2000 to June 2012. All patients performed mammography and ultrasound examination; 1/3 of those completed the follow-up with MRI (until February 2011 with 1.5 T scanner, from March 2011 with 3.0 T scanner). Results: 320 Patients (range 25 -82 years) were included. 280 underwent lipofilling after mastectomy, 40 after wide local excision. 83/320 patients had MRI to complete standard senological examination in cases of prothesis, suspicious recurrence or uncertain fat necrosis; after MRI, the patients underwent US -second look. No severe complications were observed after treatment. 232/320 were negative for all the follow-up including in this group \"oil cysts\" like normal findings due to lipofilling. Liponecrosis (64/88 cases), the most frequently observed complication, was detected in 43/64 using US and 21/64 with MRI. In 8/88 cases mammography showed calcifications, which underwent biopsy with diagnosis of fat necrosis. 16/88 patients developed homolateral recurrence (7/16 discovered with mammography and US, 9/16 confirmed with MRI). Conclusion: Lipofilling is an important reconstructive surgical application in oncologic patients. This long follow-up demonstrates that this method is safe because in our experience the majority of patients remained negative after surgery. The eventual complications are easily observed with radiological examinations and do not interfere with breast cancer recurrence early diagnosis.Invasive ductal carcinoma with marked necrosis on neoadjuvant chemotherapy: RECIST or mRECIST in MRI assessment of tumour response?

Methods and Materials: 90 consecutive HCM patients (60 males and 30 females), aged between 14 and 79 years, underwent 1.5T CMR. Indexed end-diastolic left ventricular mass (IEDLV mass) was assessed at end-diastole.LGE-MR images were performed 15 min after injection of 0.2 mmol/kg of Gadolinium. A threshold of 6 SD exceeding the mean signal intensity from normal myocardium was used to define areas of fibrosis and LGE extent was expressed as percentage to the total IEDLV myocardial mass. Clinical adverse events were prospectively assessed during a follow-up period of 40.2\u00b111.1 months. MACE included were atrial fibrillation, non-sustained and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, implantable cardioverter defibrillator implant and shock, progression of NYHA functional classes III or IV, surgery for obstructive HCM (myomectomy and mitral valve replacement), unscheduled hospitalisation, death from heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Results: The mean LGE% was 8.11\u00b16.63 g/m 2 . During the follow-up one or more MACE were recorded in 35 (38.9%) patients; 23 (25.5%) patients experienced two or more MACE.

Francone, R. Rosati, P.David, A. Frustaci, C. Catalano;  Rome/IT (giuseppe_cannavale@hotmail.it)    Purpose: Our aim was to evaluate CMR sensitivity in patients presenting with acute myocarditis with various clinical presentations and correlate results with histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively evaluated CMR sensitivity in comparison with clinical presentation in 57 patients who had in the last two years an endomyocardial biopsy diagnosis of active myocarditis and clinical history \u00b23 months. All subjects underwent at time of diagnosis a CMR and invasive cardiac examination. Immunohistochemistry and viral genomes detection by PCR were also performed. Results: Three types of clinical patterns of myocarditis were recognised: 1) Infarct-like (fever, chest pain, ST segment deflection at ECG and serum Troponin I elevation). 2) Cardiomyopathic (left ventricular dysfunction in absence of ECG or systemic abnormalities). 3) Arrhythmic (sudden occurrence of arrhythmias in absence of systemic evidence of inflammation). Early enhancement was positive in 71% (15/21) of the cases with pattern 1, 67% (14/21) with pattern 2 and 40% (6/15) with pattern 3. Myocardial damage due to different viral agents detected for each pattern was correlated with CMR findings. Conclusion: Sensitivity of CMR is high for infarct-like myocarditis, low for cardiomyopathic and very low for arrhythmic pattern. These variations are likely due to the different viral agents involved reflecting different histological patterns, causing a more extensive vascular disease in pattern 1 compared with focal myocyte and conduction tissue damage of patterns 2 and 3.Cardiac magnetic resonance vs echocardiography for the assessment of cardiac volumes and function in thalassemia intermedia patients C. Tudisca 1 , A. Meloni 2 , C. Ascioti 3 , S. Renne 3 , V. Santamaria 4 ; 1 Palermo/IT, 2 Pisa/IT, 3 Lamezia Terme/IT, 4 Vibo Valentia/IT Purpose: We aimed to compare the agreement of left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF) by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) and Echocardiography (US) in a moderately large cohort of Thalassaemia Intermedia (TI) patients. Methods and Materials: 74 TI patients (38 M; 36.7\u00b110.9 years) enrolled in the MIOT (Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassaemia) network were studied by both echo and CMR (1.5 T) within 3 months of each other. CMR cine images were acquired to assess LV parameters in a standard way. LV parameters were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography using the biplane Simpson's formula. Paired-samples t-test or Wilcoxon test, correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation (ICC) and Bland & Altman plot were used to compare CMR and US parameters. Results: All US volumes were significantly underestimated, especially the LV enddiastolic volume index (69.9\u00b118.1 ml/m2 vs 96.3\u00b117.9 ml/m2, P < 0.0001), while the US LV EF was significantly higher than the CMR EF (63.7\u00b16.6% vs 62.0\u00b17.4%, P=0",

Prognostic value of RV remodelling in pulmonary hypertension: cardiac magnetic resonance study N. Galea, M. Francone, I. Carbone, I. Iacucci, P. David, C. Vizza, C. Catalano; Rome/IT (nicogale2000@yahoo.it)Purpose: In Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH),increase of pulmonary vascular resistances results in severe right ventricular (RV) dysfunction due to increased afterload and myocardial remodelling. The aim of our study was to investigate how the morphological adaptive changes in myocardium (concentric vs eccentric hypertrophy,myocardial fibrosis at late enhancement) and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) impact survival in PH. Methods and Materials: Our study population included 83 consecutive patients with PH (56 idiopathic,9 CHD-related,16 secondary) who underwent to clinical setting, right heart catheterisation, CMR, and 6-min walk testing at the baseline. CMR protocol included cine imaging and LE acquisitions after contrast-administration (0.1 mmol/kg Gd-BOPTA) in order to measure volumes and detect fibrosis. Population was divided in groups on the basis of median value of RV mass/diastolic volume ratio (RV M/V=Gr1< 0.60,Gr2> 0.60),RVEF (GrA< 34%,GrB> 34%) and LE presence (y/n) and followed up for deaths (average:4.3\u00b11.6 yrs). Results: Increase of RV M/V ratio (> 0.60) was related to lower RV systolic and diastolic volume (respectively p=0.006 and < 0.005), but similar RV mass (p=ns). In spite of significant differences in clinical status, effort capacity and haemodynamics between the two groups,Gr2 patients have a lower mortality according to Kaplan-Mayer curve (mean survivor time Gr1:925dys,Gr2:1339dys,p=0.008). Baseline RVEF was predictor of mortality (p=0.002). DE was demonstrated in 74/85 pts and predominantly confined to RV insertion points (70/74). Multivariate analysis excluded negative impact of LE as prognostic indicators of death. Conclusion: In PH,RV hypertrophy and mild diastolic volume increase (high M/ Vratio and high RVEF) is associated with low rate of deaths, suggesting a favourable prognostic role of this parameter.Evaluation of Brugada syndrome by cardiac magnetic resonanceL. Salvatori 1 , C. Tessa 1 , i. Del Meglio 1 , S. Diciotti 2 , C. Vignali 1 , G. Casolo 1 ; 1 Lido di Camaiore/IT, 2 Firenze/IT (l.salvatori71@gmail.com) Purpose: Brugada syndrome (BrS) has been originally considered to occur in structural normal hearts. However, recent pathological and imaging data suggest that structural and functional changes may be present in this syndrome. This study was designed to elucidate whether any macroscopic heart abnormality is detectable in patients with BrS. For this purpose we used cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Methods and Materials: Twenty-nine patients displaying the BrS type-1 ECG pattern and 29 healthy controls underwent CMR (1.5 Tesla). Left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) dimensions, function and regional contractility were evaluated. Late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) imaging was obtained in 24 patients. Results: We found no difference between BrS patients and controls regarding LV and RV dimensions and ejection fraction. RV wall motion abnormalities (WMA) were detected in 19 patients (65.5%) and in 22 control subjects (75.9%). The majority of these WMA were attributable to areas of hypokinesia and found in the RV inferior wall. None of the patients showed LGE. No differences were detected between controls and the different subgroups of BrS patients according to symptoms, family history and spontaneous type-1 ECG pattern.Conclusion: BrS patients do not differ from normal subjects with regard to dimensions and global function of both LV and RV. BrS patients may show RV-WMA; however, similar changes are also present in healthy subjects and may therefore Technical innovations, TMJ disease and rare entities CT numbers of CBCT regarding position dependence on different size of field-of-view M. Imura 1 , T. Todoroki 2 ; 1 Kyoto/JP, 2 Osaka/JP (minori.imura@gmail.com)Purpose: Quality-controlled x-ray beam CBCT (QX-CBCT) is equipped with calibration function for HU measurements in cone beam CT for the first time. In this study, we examined its characteristics of CT numbers in terms of cone angle effect represented as different field-of-view. Methods and Materials: 1) Reproducibility and possible variation of CT numbers of QX-CBCT within exposure area on three different FOV were examined. Water phantom attached to QX-CBCT for calibration was scanned four times. Mean CT numbers of region of interest (ROI) at the centre and twenty peripherals in each axial image were measured. 2) Varying concentrations of iodinated solution phantoms (0-4700 HU) were scanned at 100 kV for QX-CBCT and 80 to 140 kV for MDCT on all FOV. ROIs were placed at the centre of each phantom on the basis of water phantom study. Correlation of CT numbers between QX-CBCT and MDCT were examined by the Pearson's correlations analysis. Results: 1) Mean CT numbers of QX-CBCT at each independent ROI were reproducible for all FOV (R=0.86-0.95, P < 0.0001). CT numbers at the centre region were consistent regardless of the size of FOV, whereas the values tended to be higher and heterogeneous at the outer edge of exposure area. The consistent area was sphere like shape within exposure area. 2) CT numbers of QX-CBCT exhibited significant correlation to those of MDCT under 2500 HU (R=0.98, P < 0.0001) for all FOV. Conclusion: When handing the CT numbers of QX-CBCT, region-dependence within exposure area due to the effect of cone angle should carefully be considered.Dual-source 128-slice MDCT neck: radiation dose and image quality estimation of a clinically relevant dual-energy, high-pitch, standard single-energy protocol J. Paul, E. Mbalisike, T.J. Vogl; Frankfurt a.Main/DE (jijopaul1980@gmail.com)    Purpose: To estimate the radiation dose and image quality of a clinically relevant single-source (SSCT), high-pitch (HPCT), and dual-energy (DECT) protocols of an innovative dual-source (DSCT) system for the examination of neck. Methods and Materials: 180 patients were randomised to one of the three protocols: 60 patients (age: 55.4\u00b112 years; range: 44-84 years) were examined with a SSCT, other 60 (59.5\u00b116.4 years; R: 40-85) with HPCT, and the last 60 (61.1\u00b114.9 years; R: 47-84) were examined with a DECT protocol. All examinations were performed using a DSCT system. The used protocols: group-1 (SSCT: 120 kV; effective mAs: 185.4\u00b117.7), group-2 (HPCT: 120 kV; eff.mAs: 97.7\u00b111.8), and group-3 (DECT: 80 kV/140 kV with tin-filter; eff.mAs: 248.5\u00b125.7; 187\u00b121.2). A 100-ml Iomeprol non-ionic contrast material was injected in to the patients during examination. Results: Insignificant results were yielded regarding SNR and CNR between the Quantitative and qualitative analyses showed similar results for SSCT, HPCT, and DECT-0.6 W datasets regarding quality. HPCT yielded lower dose compared to other groups; however, the DECT achieved a lower and significant dose difference from the SSCT protocol. HPCT and DECT can be used with similar image quality and lower radiation dose compared to SSCT for the scans and can be utilised various clinical advantages.Right heart involvement in thalassaemia major ( TM ) patients: a cardiac MR (CMR) assessmentF. Pitocco, I. Di Giampietro, A. De Vivo, P. Cianciulli, C. Liguori,  B. Beomonte Zobel; Rome/IT (f.pitocco@unicampus.it)    Purpose: TM patients should develop right heart failure caused by right ventricle (RV) impairment related to chronic anaemia. It is still unknown if iron myocardial deposition and iron overload can influence the RV functional/volumetric parameters. Our aim was to define normal ranges for RV volumes and RV ejection fraction in TM with and without myocardial iron overload. Methods and Materials: We performed CMR examination (Scanner 1.5T, Avanto, Siemens-Germany) in a setting of 220 patients with TM under iron chelation therapy and without clinical or instrumental signs of right heart failure (mean age 37.8 \u00b1 12.8 ys; mean body surface area kg/m 2 1.64\u00b10.24;13%). Myocardial iron overload was considered T2*< 20 ms. RV-EF, volumes and mass index were evaluated. Results: Myocardial iron overload in 13% of population was noted. A significant difference was found between mean RVEF in patients with iron overload and RVEF in patients without iron overload (60\u00b16.7% vs 60\u00b111%, p < 0.01), with no differences between sex. A significant difference was found in RV stroke, end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices between the two groups (45, 30.75 vs 49, 31, 76 ml/ m2, p < 0.01). No significant difference was found in right ventricle mass values (19 \u00b1 5 vs 15 \u00b1 13 g/m2). Conclusion: Iron overload can damage right heart myocardium in the same way of left heart myocardium, showing similar functional impairment and volumetric enlargement. CMR is an useful technique for a correct evaluation of heart function and iron myocardial deposition in these kinds of patients.B-0469 15:21\u03b2-thalassaemia as a new potential risk factor for left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC): a cardiac MRI evaluation C.

Kan; HongKong/HK  (vincentkpfung@hotmail.com)    Purpose: To describe the clinical and angiographic features of carotid blowout syndrome (CBS) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with radiotherapy (RT). Methods and Materials: 14 patients with RT-treated NPC who underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) from 2000 to 2012 for management of CBS were retrospectively reviewed. The initial T and N staging of NPC, duration between diagnosis of NPC to CBS, number of radiotherapies (RT) received for recurrence were studied. Distributions and sizes of pseudoaneurysms were analysed. Results: 9 patients (64%) with CBS had initial T3 disease or above while 11 patients (79%) presented with N1 stage or above. Time interval between diagnosis of NPC and presentation of CBS varied from 4 months to 468 months (mean = 181months). Most patients (n = 8, 57%) had recurrence and all received further RTs. Pseudoaneurysms were identified in 11 patients (79%) with the maximum diameter Friday contained within a continuous or incomplete lamella (81% and 19%, respectively). 31% of AEA canals was classified as dehiscent. PEA was identifiable in 98/106 on the axial plane, 104/106 on coronal and 101/106 on sagittal. Most of PEAs (98%) were located within the skull base; only 2% of PEAs was separated from the skull base by a posterior ethmoid cell or sphenoid sinus. Conclusion: CBCT allows a precise evaluation of ethmoidal arteries anatomy.

Mean T2 relaxation time values and changes over time were measured for each compartment. Statistical analysis was performed using a mixed random effects model adjusted for age, sex and BMI. Results: All subjects showed significant increases in mean T2 over time (baseline-24 -48 months) in each compartment. The yearly rate of T2 change was highest Using T2 relaxation time as a sensitive biomarker for cartilage collagen network integrity, this is the first study that radiologically demonstrates over 48 months, that healthy subjects undergo age-related changes in cartilage composition resulting in continuously increasing T2 values over time.

Our results demonstrate the superiority of PET/MRI in detecting malignant liver lesions compared to PET/CT. Whole body PET/MRI with 68 Ga-DOTATOC bears the potential of replacing PET/ CT as the current gold standard in the staging of NETs.",

Nadrljanski, O.S. Radulovic, Z.C. Milosevic; Belgrade/RS(dr.m.nadrljanski@gmail.com)    Purpose: Positive enhancement integral (PEI) of the area under the curve after the contrast injection on breast MRI, presented as the time-intensity graph and maps, provides insight into tumour perfusion. The purpose of this paper was to contribute to the standardisation of the PEI values in IDC, DCIS and breast parenchyma and to compare the PEI values: IDC Vs. parenchyma, DCIS Vs. parenchyma and IDC Vs. DCIS. As the quantitative parameter, PEI and tumour-to-parenchyma ratio may be helpful in differential diagnosis of DCIS Vs. IDC, with the standard DCE-MRI exam and other parameters of fMRI. To our knowledge, this is the first paper testing the PEI values in the differential diagnosis: DCIS Vs. IDC. Fully automated quantitative MRI BD measurements confirm higher breast density in cancer patients as compared to healthy controls. Although not statistically significant due to the small sample size, these results are entirely consistent with the fact that breast density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer.To excise or not to excise?

Results: The obese group Included 29.2% girls and 70.8% boys, and the eutrophic group included 69.2% girls and 30.8% boys. The prevalence of NAFLD was 19.2% for the eutrophic group and 83% for the obese group. The ROC generated for the HRG, with a cutoff point of 13, had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

Elie, W.J.H. Veldkamp, R.E. van Engen, M.J.M. Broeders; Nijmegen/NL (s.elie@lrcb.nl)Purpose: Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is expected to improve visibility of lesions by reducing overprojection of tissue. This phantom study investigates the image quality of DBT images by comparing in-plane contrast and detail performance to digital mammography (DM) images in simulated mammographic background conditions. Methods and Materials: Contrast-detail visibility was compared by imaging a 0.1 mm aluminium contrast-detail phantom (CDmam 3.4) that was positioned between two layers containing a breast-simulating material with comparable scatter and primary transmission properties. To obtain increased phantom thickness PMMA was added. The related simulated breast thicknesses were 32, 60 and 90 mm. Images were acquired with the following systems: Sectra Microdose L30 (DM, Sectra prototype DBT) and Hologic Selenia Dimensions (both DM and DBT mode). For each imaging mode and thickness eight images were acquired. X-ray spectra corresponded to clinical practice, where the mean glandular dose (MGD) of the DM mode was matched to the MGD of the DBT imaging mode. The CDmam images were scored by human observers and contrast and detail performance was evaluated. Results: Results showed that the contrast resolution (object diameters 0.4-2.0 mm and object thicknesses 0.03-0.16 \u00b5m) improves in DBT. However, DBT showed a loss in spatial resolution (object diameters 0.06-0.31 mm and object thicknesses 0.2-2.0 \u00b5m) compared to DM. Conclusion: The in-plane DBT images are less affected by overprojecting structures resulting in better contrast resolution. However, smaller objects are better visualised with DM, due to superior spatial resolution in DM images compared to in-plane DBT images.Can a colour representation of grey-scale images improve object detectability in mammography?

Methods and Materials: 21 DW MRI at b values of 0, 500 and 1000 were prospectively performed on 20 patients with acute pancreatitis. The collections and necrosis with peripheral bright signal on DW MR Images were accepted as positive. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of peripheral (if DW MRI was positive)and central parts of the collections and/or necrosis were measured by three radiologists. Intra and inter-observer reliabilities were analyzed. Student`s t-test was used to compare the ADC values between infected and sterile groups. Results: Except 1 false positive result DWI could successfully estimate the presence of infection. The mean ADC value of peripheral diffusion restricted areas was found to be 1.16 \u00b1 0.14 x10 -3 mm 2 /s.

Wise, I. Delakis, E. Kulama, D. McRobbie; London/UK Purpose: Evaluation and optimisation of image quality plays an important role in enhancing the diagnostic value of mammography studies. Mammographic image quality is typically assessed on the basis of analysing images of the CDMAM contrast-detail phantom for mammography. However, CDMAM analysis can suffer from intra-observer variations and limited statistics. The purpose of this work was to apply Hotelling-observer SNR analysis in a comparative evaluation of FFDM detectors. Methods and Materials: The generalised normalised noise power spectrum (GN-NPS) was measured by collecting flat field images of 4 cm PMMA phantom. The generalised modulation transfer function (GMTF) was then measured by placing a 0.02-mm Tungsten edge in the middle of the 4 cm PMMA phantom. This setup allowed for scatter and focal-spot unsharpness to be incorporated in the measurements. The Hotelling-observer SNR was calculated for input signal originating from gold discs of varying thicknesses and diameters, to replicate CDMAM analysis. Results: For each FFDM detector, Hotelling-observer SNR increased with the diameter and thickness of the gold disc. The Hotelling-observer SNR results showed variations in the performance of FFDM detectors evaluated, demonstrating the use of this metric as a differentiator. In addition, Hotelling-observer SNR values were higher for systems displaying better CDMAM analysis results, demonstrating the relation between the two metrics. Conclusion: We used Hotelling observer-SNR to evaluate the performance of FFDM detectors, on the basis of a methodology accounting for focal-spot unsharpness and scatter. The calculated task SNR values varied across the detectors evaluated, in a manner commensurate with CDMAM analysis results.Mondaycontrast of the monochromatic X-rays was better than that of the polychromatic x-rays. Mean values of standard deviation of linear attenuation reduction characteristics of the phantom were 2.78% and 0.87% on conventional polychromatic and monochromatic DEXA, respectively. Conclusion: Monochromatic DEXA using a multilayer mirror would be provided a precise measurement of bone mineral density by achieving the better performance with lower radiation dose than that of the conventional polychromatic DEXA.Phase contrast imaging using grating interferometer: preliminary results D.Kang, E.

Methods and Materials: Twenty-eight patients with urolithiasis symptoms were examined using dual-energy CT (pitch 0.5, tube voltage with fast kVp switching 80/140 kVp, DFOV 5\u00d75 cm). Data obtained during the examination were analysed on a clinical workstation with dedicated software (GSI Viewer). Urinary stones were evaluated separately by measuring Zeff value using small ROI method. The Zeff values were assigned to the corresponding composition and were compared to the results of chemical analysis after the removal of stones from the urinary tract. Results: The Zeff analyses revealed 3 types of calculi: homogenous stones (22 cases) with the high Zeff value: 13.52 (\u00b1 0.6); homogenous stones (3 cases) with the low Zeff value (from 6.9 to 7.1, mean 6.98); heterogeneous stones (3 cases) with Zeff values 11.23 to 11.9 (mean 11.45) and 14.50 to 14.90 (mean 14.74). The cases of first group correspond to calcium oxalate stones.

Santodirocco 4 ; 1 Palermo/IT, 2 Naples/IT, 3 Pisa/IT, 4 San Giovanni Rotondo/IT Purpose: Due to the limited data available in literature, the aim of this multicentre study was to prospectively assess in thalassaemia major ( TM ) the efficacy of combined deferiprone (DFP) and desferrioxamine (DFO) regimen versus DFP and DFO in monotherapy by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over a follow-up of 18 months. Methods and Materials: Among the first 1135 TM patients in the MIOT (Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassaemia) network, we evaluated those who had been received combined regimen (N=51) or DFP (N=39) and DFO (N=74) monotherapies between the two MRI scans. Iron overload was measured by T2* multiecho technique. Biventricular function parameters were quantitatively evaluated by cine images. Results: The percentage of patients that maintained a normal global heart T2* value was comparable between DFP+DFO versus both groups. Among the patients with myocardial iron overload at baseline, the changes in the global heart T2* and in biventricular function were not significantly different in DFP+DFO versus the DFP group. The changes in the global heart T2* were significantly higher in the DFP+DFO versus DFO group, without a difference in biventricular function. Among the patients with hepatic iron at baseline the increase in liver T2* values was significantly higher in combination versus both groups. Conclusion: In TM patients at the dosages used in the real world, combined DFP+DFO regimen was more effective in removing cardiac iron load only versus the DFO group and in clearing hepatic iron versus both groups. Combined therapy did not show an additional effect on heart function.Author Disclosures: C. Tudisca: Author; Dr. Pepe Alessia received speaker's honoraria from Chiesi, ApoPharma Inc. and Novartis.

Tille, M. Gutberlet, H. Thiele, M. Grothoff; Leipzig/DE (mandy.tille@herzzentrum-leipzig.de)Purpose: Right ventricular (RV) injury is common after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and can be accurately detected by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). In this longitudinal study we sought to analyse RV myocardial remodelling after STEMI. Methods and Materials: We studied 41 patients with RVI 1-4 days after primary angioplasty in STEMI. T2-weighted and late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) CMR was used for visualising oedema and necrosis. Cine-imaging was performed to access volumes and wall motion abnormalities (WMA), which, in combination with oedema were considered diagnostic for RVI. A second CMR examination was performed with a mean follow-up period of 5.2 months. Results: The initial examination showed 17/41 patients with LGE. The remaining 24 patients demonstrated oedema and WMA only. There was no difference in RV ejection fraction (RV-EF) between these two groups (43.9\u00b17.4% vs. 49.5\u00b14.6%, p < 0.001); however, RV-EF was decreased in both. In follow-up, no oedema was detectable and mean RV-EF was within a normal range again in both, patients with LGE (49.5\u00b15.6%) and patients without LGE (48.8\u00b15.6%, p=0.69).",

Troponin I cut-off value for new LGE was 0.7 ng/ml (p=0.018). Ten (23.3%) patients had new LGE at the area supplied by SB, eight (18.6%) patients at the area of distal embolisation and four (9.3%) patients in both localisations. There was clear correlation between LGE localisation and geometry of the bifurcation (smaller modified distal bifurcation angle in SB area LGE group 22 \u00b1 9\u00b0 vs 41 \u00b1 13\u00b0, p=0.001).

Methods and Materials: In a retrospective cohort study, the clinical and CMR data of 110 Iranian symptomatic patients with repaired TOF during 35 years ago were collected. Cardiac function indexes were compared in two groups of patients with and without DE. Results: Patient's mean age was 21.9\u00b16.9 years. 65 (59.1%) patients were male and 45 (40.9%) were female. DE was positive in 103 (93.6%) and negative in 7 (6.4%) patients. The position of DE was \"right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) without other sites\" in 81 (78.6%) and \"RVOT with other sites\" in 22 (21.4%) patients. Mean right ventricle end diastolic volume (RVEDV) in DE positive and DE negative was 258.2 mL/m2\u00b191.8 and 185.5 mL/m2\u00b138.2, respectively (P=0.047). Mean of right ventricle end systolic volume (RVESV) in DE positive and DE negative was 162.8 mL/m2\u00b171.1 and 103.3 mL/m2\u00b135.9, respectively (P=0.045) and mean of right ventricle ejection fraction (RVEF) in DE positive and DE negative was 38.2%\u00b17.7 and 44.8%\u00b19.1, respectively (P=0.010). Conclusion: DE is a common finding in symptomatic patients with repaired TOF. Using CMR modality, we found DE as an indicative of ventricular scarring or fibrosis in these patients showing a direct correlation with RV dysfunction.Diastolic versus systolic acquisition of T1 maps of normal human myocardium at 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging U.

Differences and relations between diastolic and systolic T1 times of normal myocardium were investigated. Methods and Materials: 40 healthy subjects (20 females and 20 males, age 23\u00b13 years, age range 20-35 years) underwent 1.5 T magnetic resonance T1-mapping with motion-corrected MOLLI (Modified Look Locker Inversion Recovery) acquired in three short axes (basal, mid-ventricular and apical) in systole and end-diastole. Regional T1 values were determined in all 16 AHA-segments; their mean was interpreted as myocardial T1 time. Resulting T1 values were analyzed employing t-test, analysis of variance and correlation analysis. Results: Mean myocardial T1 times (984\u00b128 ms in diastole and 959\u00b121 ms in systole) as well as all segmental mean T1 values in diastole and systole differed significantly (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Correlations between diastolic and systolic T1 times were, however, strong (r=0.98 for myocardial and r=0.81 for segmental T1 times). Mean diastolic versus systolic T1 values in different AHAsegments differed significantly (p < 0.0001 in both phases), but there was a strong correlation between segmental mean T1 values in diastole and systole (r=0.83).",

Methods and Materials: We performed 357 foetal MRI and including 41 cases under 24 weeks of gestation with the US suspect of posterior cranial fossa pathology. Foetal MRI was performed with a 1.5-T Magnet. We evaluated the biometrical parameters of the cerebellum, vermis morphology and biometry, IV ventricle, cerebellopontine angle, cisterna magna and tentorium insertion. We highlighted the presence of a linear hypointensity on T2 images in correspondence of the inferior part of the vermis, the \"tail sign\"; this feature corresponds histologically to a thickness of the 4 th ventricle roof that appears raised and dysplastic. Results: Foetal MRI detected alterations of the posterior cranial fossa in 38/41 cases and excluded the US suspicion of pathologies in the remaining 3 cases. MRI results were compared with post-mortem results in 20/38 cases or after birth follow-up in the remaining. Results were confirmed in 36/38 cases and disconfirmed in 2 cases.

Methods and Materials: Four pregnant sheep carrying singleton foetuses (gestational age 123 days) were anaesthetized to undergo foetal MR examination on a 1.5 T imager. A newly developed MR-compatible Doppler ultrasound sensor was placed on the abdomen of the ewe, above the foetal heart. The recorded signal of the foetal heart was transferred to the ECG trigger unit of the MR scanner and used for foetal cardiac triggering. Blood flow velocity measurements of the foetal descending aorta were assessed and compared with Doppler ultrasound measurements performed following MR examination. Time-volume curves were assessed and mean peak velocities were calculated. Results: Triggering of the foetal heart rate was possible in all MR examinations allowing high quality flow measurements of the foetal aorta. Comparison of both methods revealed concordant results, both revealing characteristic arterial flow waveforms and average peak flow velocities of 60 cm/s (\u00b13.4) and 62 cm/s (\u00b19.2), respectively.

            "text": "purpose of this study was to investigate changes in foetal lung volume (FLV) in CDH patients and to calculate weekly growth rates of the FLV using serial MRI. Methods and Materials: MR-FLV was measured in 89 foetuses with CDH between 19 and 39 weeks gestation. All foetuses received two MR examinations with at least four weeks in between. In addition to the absolute MR-FLV (aMR-FLV) and the observed to expected MR-FLV (o/eMR-FLV) a weekly growth rate of the aMR-FLV was determined for each foetus. Results: In all but two foetuses the aMR-FLV increased between the two examinations (mean 11.1 ml, range 1.5-37.7 ml). Mean o/eMR-FLV at the first MRI (mean 26.0\u00b13.1 weeks gestation) was 33.3\u00b112.2% (range 10.5-79.1%) and 29.5\u00b110.9%(range 10.8-63.7%) at the second MRI (mean 33.9\u00b12.4 weeks gestation). 54/89 foetuses (60.7%) showed a decrease of the o/eMR-FLV during pregnancy with a mean reduction of 9.4% (range 2.2-31.7%), 23 foetuses (25.8%) increasing o/eMR-FLVs with a mean increase of 7.7% (range 2.2-26.2%) and 12 foetuses (13.5%) revealed stable values. CDH patients had lower weekly growth rates with an average growth rate of only 26% compared to healthy foetuses. Conclusion: The individual development of FLV in CDH patients during pregnancy is variable with decreasing, stable and increasing o/eMR-FLVs. In individual cases, the o/eMR-FLV relatively changed by more than 80% during pregnancy. Follow-up examinations are advisable prior to decision-making about pre-and postnatal therapeutic options.Periventricular nodular heterotopia: prenatal ultrasound findings E. Blondiaux, C. Sileo, C. Nahama-Allouche, M.-L. Moutard, A. Gelot, J.-M. Jouannic, H. Ducou le Pointe, C. Garel; Paris/FR (eleonore.blondiaux@trs.aphp.fr)Purpose: To describe the prenatal sonographic findings suggestive of periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH). Methods and Materials: This retrospective study included foetuses referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diagnosed with PVNH, which was confirmed by post-natal MRI or autopsy. The type of PVNH, associated ventriculomegaly and associated malformations were reported. Results: 11 foetuses were included (9 females, 2 males) with a mean gestational age at diagnosis of 31 weeks' gestation (23-34). PVNH were small and diffuse (n=7), large and multiple (n=1) or single (n=3). A targeted ultrasonographic (US) scan performed before foetal MRI missed the diagnosis in 4 cases [diffuse (n=1) and single (n=3)]. Another US scan performed after MRI diagnosed PVNH in 2 of these 4 cases. Ventriculomegaly was present in 6 cases[uni-(n=4)  or bilateral (n=2)]. All PVNH appeared as nodules of intermediate echogenicity protruding into the ventricular lumen. In all cases of diffuse PVNH, the frontal horns and bodies of the lateral ventricles displayed a square shape with irregular borders. Associated cerebral malformations were observed in 7 cases and included corpus callosum agenesis (n=4 with additional malformations in 2 cases) and retrocerebellar cyst (n=3). Extracerebral malformations were also present (n=2). Maternal MRI was performed in 5/6 cases of isolated small and diffuse PVNH in female foetuses and demonstrated PVNH in 2 cases. Conclusion: PVNH are underdiagnosed at prenatal US even on targeted scans. Indented ventricular borders on axial views and irregular square shaped lateral ventricles on coronal views are suggestive of PVNH at prenatal US.Role of foetal MR in the evaluation of gastrointestinal tract anomaliesS. Bernardo, V. Vinci, P. Sollazzo, M. Sergi, M. Saldari, L. Manganaro; Rome/IT (silviabernardo@live.it)Purpose: To determine if foetal MRI may confirm, complete or change the diagnosis in cases of sonographically detected GI tract abnormalities. Methods and Materials: This is a prospective study (December 2010-June 2012) of 27 foetal abdominal MRI scans. The exam was performed between 24 and 38 weeks of gestation on a 1.5-T magnet. MRI exam was performed within two weeks from the US examination. US diagnoses included: omphalocele (n=3); bowel dilatation (n=7), associated with ascites in 4 cases, foetal abdominal cyst (n=5), oesophageal atresia (n=2), hyperechoic bowel (n=3), associated with ascites in 1 case; meconium peritonitis (n=3), only ascites (n=2). MRI protocol included T1 W fast gradient-echo (Flash 2D) and T2 W half-Fourier acquired single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) sequences in axial, coronal and sagittal planes. Results: Foetal MRI examination made correct diagnoses in 25 patients, it changed US diagnoses in 5 cases of foetal abdominal cysts and in one case of hyperechoic bowel it excluded any intestinal abnormalities. It provided more informations than US in the cases of intestinal dilatation, where foetal MRI was able to identify the level of obstruction and in 2 patients where it revealed the presence of a microcolon. and in 6/10 cases of partial vermis agenesis. We had no evidence of \"tail sign\" in all cases of vermis hypoplasia, vermis malrotation and rhombencephalosynapsis. Conclusion: Foetal MRI represents a useful imaging technique for the diagnosis of posterior cranial fossa pathologies to confirm and characterise different cerebellar malformations.Realtime cine-MRI in children and foetuses with head and neck pathology T. Feygin, A. Pollock, J. Stein, T. Victoria; Philadelphia, PA/US (Joel.Stein@uphs.upenn.edu) Purpose: To determine the feasibility and applications of real-time cine-MRI in functional evaluation of selected pathologic entities of head and neck in children and foetuses. Methods and Materials: For the foetal assessment, cine-MRI evaluations were performed in 370 patients in addition to routine foetal MR evaluation of different organ systems. Different patterns of foetal swallowing were identified in foetuses with head and neck pathologies. Real time MR techniques were applied in 12 volunteers and 5 patients with 22q deletion for swallowing and phonation evaluation. Preliminary comparison was done for compatibility of value of MR cine technique and barium swallowing with video recording. Results: Real-time cine MRI was technically feasible in evaluation of various prenatal and postnatal head and neck pathologies. Foetal swallowing in patients with head and neck masses, cleft lip and palate, micrognathia differs from control group of foetuses with variety of other entities, not involving head and neck. The various phases of swallowing were identifiable, providing information that could be used in planning of foetal delivery. The MR patterns of swallowing and phonation in healthy volunteers and children with 22 q deletion were identifiable and the obtained information was seemingly compatible with fluoroscopy data. Conclusion: Cine-MRI methods are technically feasible and valuable tools in both prenatal and postnatal assessment, with increasing applications in the functional evaluation of head and neck pathology. Magnetic-resonance-imaging-based ratio of fetal lung volume to foetal body volume as a new prognostic marker in congenital diaphragmatic hernia M. Weidner, C. Hagelstein, A. Debus, A. Walleyo, S.O. Sch\u00f6nberg, T. Schaible, K.A. B\u00fcsing, S. Kehl, K.W. Neff; Mannheim/DE (Meike.Weidner@gmx.de) Purpose: To evaluate prognostic accuracy of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based ratio of fetal lung volume (FLV) to fetal body volume (FBV) concerning survival and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).Methods and Materials:The local research ethics committee approved this study and written informed consent was obtained. MRI was performed in 96 fetuses with CDH and in 44 fetuses without any affection of lung and body volume. FLV and FBV were measured and used to calculate the ratio of FLV/FBV. Additionally, subgroup analysis of all fetuses whose growth development was less than 80 % of the expected value was performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to model the dependence of survival and ECMO requirement on the ratio. Prognostic accuracy was evaluated by applying the area under the curve (AUC). Results: 78 (81 %) fetuses survived and 35 (36 %) neonates needed ECMO therapy. The ratio of FLV/FBV was significantly higher in surviving fetuses (0.013\u00b10.006 vs. 0.007\u00b10.004; p < 0.0001; AUC=0.829). Neonates receiving ECMO therapy showed prenatally a significant lower ratio (0.009\u00b10.006 vs. 0.014\u00b10.005; p=0.0001; AUC=0.811). According to subgroup analysis for fetuses with growth restriction (n=13), AUC increased to AUC=0.875 for prediction of survival. Conclusion: The ratio FLV/FBV is able to predict neonatal survival and ECMO requirement in children with CDH. Unlike other prognostic parameters (i.e. observed/ expected MR-FLV, ultrasound observed/expected lung-to-head ratio) it is independent of reference to a control group and may enhance prognostic accuracy especially in patients whose growth development differs from expectation.Repetitive MR measurements of lung volume in foetuses withcongenital diaphragmatic hernia to investigate the individual development of pulmonary hypoplasia during pregnancy C. Hagelstein, M. Weidner, A. Debus, A. Walleyo, S.O. Sch\u00f6nberg, T. Schaible, S. Kehl, K.A. B\u00fcsing, K.W. Neff; Mannheim/DE (Claudia.Hagelstein@umm.de) Purpose: Little is known about the individual development of lung hypoplasia in foetuses with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) during pregnancy. TheConclusion:It was moderate to poor agreement between the two centres, for the overall score and the MLO score. A possible reason for the poor agreement might be because of the differences in the national quality assurance manual. It is important to further analyse and investigate the reasons for the low accordance.Radiation dose levels assessment in mammography C. Louren\u00e7o, P. Sousa, S.I. Rodrigues, A.F.C.L. Abrantes, L.P.V. Ribeiro, K.B. Azevedo, R.P.P. Almeida; Faro/PT (a35589@ualg.pt) Purpose: To measure radiation dose levels in mammography of two different institutions (A and B) and to compare them with international guidelines. Methods and Materials: A survey of exposure parameters (kV and mAs) and sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics (age, gender, weight and height) of patients was used to perform the calculation of entrance skin dose (ESD) medium glandular dose (MGD) of the 548 examinations observed. For viability measurements, the dose rate and quality control using the RF detector Unfors Xi were carried out. Through mathematical formulas, the values of ESD (Gy) and MGD (mGy) were calculated.Results: The values [[Unable to Display Character: &#8203;]][[Unable to Display Character: &#8203;]]of the ESD for a full examination were 6.59 \u00b1 3.61 mGy to institution A and 6.27 \u00b1 3.15 mGy to B institution. Also, the values [[Unable to Display Character: &#8203;]][[Unable to Display Character: &#8203;]]of MGD obtained for a full examination were 1.40 \u00b1 0.43 mGy for institution A and 1.39 \u00b1 0.57 mGy for institution B. About ESD, only the value of institution B was slightly higher than the same in France and was lower than all other international guidelines. The MGD was lower than the international guidelines in both institutions.Conclusion:The ESD values were generally lower than international guidelines, with only one exception. This exception must be analysed to achieve the lowest possible dose. MGD values [[Unable to Display Character: &#8203;]][[Unable to Display Character: &#8203;]]calculated were found below the diagnostic reference levels, but it is important to keep reconsidering the protocols used, to optimise them.",

Methods and Materials: Four experienced PGMI radiographers from both locations (UK/Cambridge and Norway/Oslo) independently assessed and classified a selection of 112 exams (CC and MLO of each breast) from each centre, by giving each image a separate PGMI score and an overall score for the exam: P=perfect=3, G=good=2, M=moderately good=1, and I=inadequate=0. The selected exams contained all four categories of PGMI. We assessed the overall score for the exam and additionally chose to assess the MLO score. Inter-observer agreement was assessed for both groups (Kappa analysis). Results: Kappa analyses of overall score gave poor agreement (Mean Kappa < 0.2) between the PGMI radiographers in Cambridge and Oslo when both Cambridge and Oslo exams were assessed. Analyses of the score for MLO images gave fair agreement (Kappa 0.2-0.29) between the two centres assessing the Cambridge images. Analyses of the Oslo MLO images gave a poor Kappa agreement. Individual Kappa agreement of the MLO varied from moderate (Kappa 0.48) to poor agreement (< 0.2) between the radiographers at both centres.Patient satisfaction assessment in mammography examsL.

Botnar 2 ; 1 Munich/DE, 2 London/DE Purpose:To study elastin-targeted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of murine myocardial infarction. Methods and Materials: Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in C57BL/6J mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Elastin-target ed MRI was performed on day 7 following myocardial infarction using CP-1052 in comparison to conventional Gd-DTPA-enhanced cardiac MRI. Competition experiments were carried out with La-1052, in which the paramagnetic gadolinium core is replaced by lanthanum. Further, delayed enhancement studies were compared to ex-vivo 2.3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Results: CNR after Gd-DPTA injection peaked at 10 minutes and returned to preinjection values at 60 minutes. After injection of CP-1052, the CNR peaked at 45 minutes and was significantly higher than Gd-DTPA at 30 minutes (p=0.04), 45 minutes (p=0.02) and 60 minutes (p=0.02). Competition experiments with La-1052 revealed a significantly reduced CNR indicating specific binding. Ex-vivo TTC staining of explanted hearts revealed good correlation for infarct size determination with elastin-targeted MRI. Conclusion: Elastin-targeted cardiac MRI enables visualisation of injured myocardium in an experimental mouse model of myocardial infarction with a higher CNR and enhanced binding characteristics. Improved dynamic MRI with CP-1052 is attributed to its higher relaxivity and its affinity for elastin.Comparison of nanobodies and conventional monoclonal antibodiesfor in vivo fluorescence imaging of lymphomas P.

Kaul 1 ; 1 Hamburg/DE, 2 Berlin/DE (ekoziole@uke.de)    Purpose: Preclinical methods for validation of tumour therapy response are generally limited to manual tumour size estimation using a calliper. The purpose of our study was to establish tumour xenograft mouse models allowing non-invasive, multimodal tumour imaging and monitoring. To further characterise tumour tissue for early therapy response, multiparametric MR was established. Methods and Materials: Tumour cells of human origin (colon, mamma) were stably transfected with the human sodium iodine symporter (hNIS) gene. Mouse tumour xenograft models were established. Imaging was performed on 7T MRI (ClinScan, Bruker) and SPECT/CT (NanoSPECT, Mediso). To monitor tumour growth by MRI, size was measured using a T2-weighted sequence. Additionally, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI (0.15 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA) were performed. To analyse tracer accumulation and retention time, SPECT was performed using Tc99m (100 MBq). Results: hNIS expression in both tumour entities was visualised by a strong Tc99m-uptake via SPECT-imaging when compared to hNIS-negative tumour xenografts. MR imaging allowed a precise delineation of tumour mass and volume. Signal enhancement measured by DCE was predominantly found in the tumour periphery, whilst homogenous tumour tissue showed a more uniform contrast agent distribution. Increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the tumour centre may indicate necrotic tissue. Conclusion: The hNIS-transfected tumour xenograft model is a promising tool for tumour imaging and monitoring. Tumour tissue characterisation can be analysed by MR parameters such as diffusion, perfusion and permeability in order to predict therapy response. A further characterisation is possible by pharmacokinetic modelling of tumour-specific tracer uptake.In vivo assessment of the anti-apoptotic effect of c-kit+ pluripotent bone marrow cells on ischaemic myocardium in mice withhybrid fluorescence molecular tomography -x-ray computed tomography M.

Bernsen; Rotterdam/NL (j.guenoun@erasmusmc.nl)    Purpose: To assess whether MRI can distinguish viable from non-viable transplanted cells in vivo, using either Gd-liposomes or SPIO as cell labelling agent. Methods and Materials: Gd-DTPA was incorporated in cationic liposomes. Rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) were transduced to constitutively express firefly luciferase and labelled with either SPIO (215\u00b5g Fe/ml) for 24h or 125\u00b5M Gd-liposomes (4 h). A cell concentration of 5x105 viable or non-viable rMSCs were injected in rat musculoskeletal tissue. MRI and BLI were performed on days 2, 5, 10 and 15 after injection. MRI T1 mapping (TR variation) and T2 and T2* mapping (TE variation) were performed on a 3 T clinical scanner using customised coils. Bioluminescence imaging was performed after intraperitoneal injection of D-Luciferin (100 mg/kg). At end-point (day 15) animals were sacrificed for immunofluorescent staining on iron and macrophages. Results: While MRI signal from non-viable Gd-MSCs disappeared < 1 day postinjection, signal void from non-viable SPIO-MSCs remained visible up to at least 2 weeks. Histology showed the iron to remain in situ. Viable Gd-MSCs could be distinguished from non-viable Gd-MSCs, based on both visible contrast changes and r1 and r2 relaxivity measurements. Differences in viability of SPIO-MSCs, however, could not be detected visually or by r2 measurements. Conclusion: Gd-liposomes can be used as a cell labelling tool to distinguish between viable and dead transplanted MSCs in vivo. For this purpose Gd-liposomes are favoured over SPIO nanoparticles, due to the low specificity of the latter.Methods and Materials:Near-infrared dye ZW-800 (Z) and QQM peptide (Q) were conjugated onto the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles (IO). The Z-IO-Q particles were characterised by TEM, DLS, fluorescence intensity. MR and optical imaging were carried out on 4T1 cells in vitro and tumour xenografts. The receptor specificity of the dual-modality imaging probe was also confirmed by a blocking experiment in the presence of excess amount of non-labelled QQM peptide. Results: The Z-IO-Q conjugate had an overall hydrodynamic particle size of 47.8nm. Incubation of 4T1 cells leads to more significant T2* signal drop (82.18 \u00b1 2.84%) than Z-IO (17.48 \u00b1 0.50%) (P < 0.01). In vivo MR imaging showed significantly higher accumulation of Z-IO-Q than Z-IO in 4T1 tumour xenograft, with T2* signal drop of 47.51 \u00b1 10.26% versus 15.02 \u00b1 5.13% at 2 h and 41.80 \u00b1 6.94% versus 2.93\u00b1 9.0% at 24 h post-injection for Z-IO-Q and Z-IO, respectively. The higher fluorescence intensity in the optical imaging of Z-IO-Q group was also observed. Both MR enhancement and optical imaging contrast were effectively blocked in the presence of QQM peptide. Conclusion: We have successfully developed QQM peptide as a tumour TEM8 targeting ligand that can promote both MR and optical imaging contrast enhancement in TEM8 positive tumours.Folic acid-modified dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles as nanoprobes for targeted computed tomography imaging of human lung adenocarcinoma L.-F. Zheng, H. Wang, C. Peng, M.-W. Shen, X.-Y. Shi, G.-X. Zhang; Shanghai/CN (zhenglinfeng04@yahoo.com.cn)Purpose: To study the new usage of folic acid-modified dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Au DENPs-FA) as nanoprobes for in vitro and in vivo targeted computed tomography (CT) imaging of human lung adenocarcinoma Methods and Materials: Au DENPs prepared using amine-terminated generation 5 poly (amidoamine) dendrimers as templates were covalently linked with FA, followed by an acetylation reaction to neutralise the remaining dendrimer surface amines. The formed Au DENPs-FA was used for both in vitro and in vivo targeted CT imaging of human lung adenocarcinoma cells (SPC-A1 cells) and the xenograft tumour model, which express folic acid receptors (FAR) verified by immunohistochemical staining. Results: Micro-CT images show that SPC-A1 cells can be detected under x-ray after incubation with the Au DENPs-FA in vitro and the xenograft tumour model can be imaged after intravenous, intratumoral, and intraperitoneal administration of the particles. Transmission electron microscopy data confirm that the Au DENPs-FA is able to be uptaken dominantly in the lysosomes of the cells. Combined morphological observation of cells after hematoxylin and eosin staining, MTT (3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay of cell viability, and flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis shows that the Au DENPs-FA does not affect cell morphology, viability, and cell cycle and apoptosis, indicating their good biocompatibility at the given concentration range. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the developed Au DENPs-FA have a great potential to be used as imaging probes for targeted CT imaging of human lung adenocarcinoma.Synchrotron radiation micro-CT imaging of the mouse brainA. Chabrol 1 , H. Rositi 1 , M. Marinescu 1 , M. Langer 2 , C. Olivier 2 , F. Peyrin 2 , C. Frindel 1 , M. Wiart 1 , Y. Berthez\u00e8ne 1 ; 1 Lyon/FR, 2 Grenoble/FR (aurelie_chabrol@yahoo.fr) Purpose: MRI coupled with the injection of ultrasmall particles of iron oxide (US-PIO) has been successfully applied for pre-clinical and clinical studies of cerebral inflammation following stroke. Current limitations of this approach are represented by the difficulty of interpreting MR signal changes in terms of exact USPIO localisation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Synchrotron Radiation phase micro-computerized tomography (SR-PCT) as a new method to visualise USPIO distribution into the whole brains of mice with cerebral ischaemia. Methods and Materials: The sensitivity of the technique was assessed by performing SR-PCT and MRI back-to-back in 10 mice stereotaxically injected with a range of USPIO concentrations. Eight mice with cerebral ischaemia were then intravenously injected with USPIOs and imaged back-to-back with MRI and SR-PCT. Results: SR-PCT showed hyperintense areas in the regions of MR signal loss. In stereotaxically injected animals, SR-PCT proved sensitive enough to detect iron in nanomolar quantities. In ischaemic animals, some of these hyperintense areas consisted of bright spots about 40-\u03bcm in diameter, compatible with USPIO-labelled macrophages. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of iron-labelled cells, most probably macrophages, at the same location. The SR-PCT pipeline, moreover, identified brain anatomy as clearly as histology, without the need for sectioning or staining, with an examination time of 44 minutes per brain at an isotropic spatial resolution of 8 \u03bcm. Conclusion: Phase-contrast x-ray tomography may become an invaluable complement to USPIO-enhanced MRI to study post-ischaemic inflammation in intact brain, with unequaled neuroanatomic analysis.Effect of dose reduction on cerebral CT perfusion maps: resultsfrom a hybrid digital perfusion phantom R. van den Boom 1 , M.

Prokop 1 ; 1 Nijmegen/NL, 2 Bremen/DE (R.vandenBoom@rad.umcn.nl)Purpose: To quantitatively evaluate the effect of dose reduction of a standard head CTP protocol on the perfusion maps. Methods and Materials: A hybrid digital perfusion phantom was used to simulate dose reduction in a CT perfusion acquisition. Noise patterns were obtained by scanning an epoxy filled human skull phantom on multiple mAs levels on a 320row scanner and combined with tissue attenuation curves obtained from 5 patient data for grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), artery and vein. We simulated a real clinical CTP head protocol available on the Toshiba CT console (1 scan at 200 mAs, 13 scans at 100 mAs, 5 scans at 75 mAs and all at 80 kV) with a total duration of 55s (5 mm slab thickness) and artificially reduced the dose from 100% to 10% in steps of 10%. CBF, CBV and MTT maps were calculated using PMA (ASIST-JAPAN). Mean values of GM and WM were evaluated. Results: Absolute CBF and CBV values stay within 20% of the values at original dose for CTP acquisitions at more than 50% of the original dose for both GM and WM. At 10% of the original dose, WM CBV values were overestimated with 24-107%, GM CBV values with 4-32%, and WM CBF values with 42-106%. GM CBF values were within 20% of the values at 100% of original dose. MTT values were less affected by dose reduction. Conclusion: Absolute CBF and CBV values require sufficient dose to be correct: values at low dose are overestimated. using MarsBaR (Marseilles, FR). CBF values were compared between conditions (FT, R), and resting and delta CBF (CBF[FT]-CBF[R]) values between sessions using paired t-tests. Results: CBF values were significantly higher during FT than R in both sessions (52.30 versus 47.70 ml/100 cc GM/min, p < 0.01; 52.32 versus 48.45 ml/100 cc GM/min p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in resting (47.70 versus 48.45 ml/100 cc GM/min, p> 0.05) or delta CBF between sessions (4.60 ml/100 cc GM/min versus 3.87 ml/100 cc GM/min, p> 0.05). Conclusion: Mean resting and delta CBF as measured with p-CASL were consistent over sessions, while a significant increase of CBF during motor activity could be quantified. Current efforts are directed towards assessing inter-vendor reproducibility in a larger population: the VESPA study.Are quantitative pharmacokinetic data of dynamic contrastenhanced MRI influenced by observer-related bias?

Tumours showing signs of bleeding, aberrant vessels or aneurysms were excluded. MRE was performed on an 3 Tesla MRI scanner, applying motion encoding EPI sequences in three directions and monofrequent shear wave generation by a head cradle as previously described.

To reliably use quantitative CBF in clinical practice, inter-session variability needs to be established. The current study assesses reproducibility of resting and delta CBF in the primary motor cortex measured with pseudocontinuous-ASL (p-CASL) during rest (R) and fingertapping (FT) in healthy volunteers. Methods and Materials: Ten participants (mean age 22y, 5 male) underwent 3D p-CASL and T1w scanning at 3 T (GE Healthcare, US) twice. Sessions were separated by 1-4 weeks. During p-CASL participants performed 2 min of 1-Hz auditory paced bimanual FT alternated with 2 min of R, 4 times per session. Data were realigned, coregistered and normalised using SPM8 (London, UK). CBF values from gray matter only were extracted from the bilateral primary motor cortex Conclusion: The presented method allows fully automated observer-independent quantification of microangiopathic HU-induced reduction of the white matter in CT with high correlation to gold standard MRI.Diagnosis of lumbosacral transitional vertebrae on lumbar MRI: role of spinal and paraspinal anatomic markers and value of additional whole-spine localiser N.

Conclusion: Although inter-scanner reliability is lower than intra-scanner, there is a very high similarity of the outcomes at different times and from two different scanners. Our findings support the feasibility of cross-site pooling of whole-brain ASL data, and CBF values with longer PLD time could be more reliable.Software for the radiological view: fully automated CT-based quantification of microangiopathic density reduction in white matter in comparison to gold standard MRI U. Hanning 1 , I. Noelte 2 , G. Homann 1 , T. Niederstadt 1 , V. Hesselmann 1 , W. Heindel 1 , A. Kemmling 3 ; 1 M\u00fcnster/DE, 2 Mannheim/DE, 3 Hamburg/DE(uhanning@uni-muenster.de)    Purpose: Assessment of white matter lesions is primarily a domain of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); however, computed tomography (CT) is the more frequently used diagnostic procedure. The reduction of density of white matter in CT images can be used as a surrogate for the severity of microangiopathic WM changes. We present a new CT-based fully automated rater-independent method for quantification of microangiopathic white matter changes. Methods and Materials: Tissue segmentation was performed in 600 normal brains MRI (3.0 Tesla, T1-3D-Turbo-Field-Echo) of two large population studies (BiDirect and SEARCH-Health Study) to obtain a probabilistic WM-tissue-map in standard MNI-152 space (published previously).The tissue-specific density (Hounsfield Unit, HU) within WM-space was determined by the mean of all voxel densities weighted by WM content: \u03a3 (HUxyz \u00d7 Pxyz (WM))/ \u03a3 (Pxyz (WM); (HUxyz = density of voxelxyz; Pxyz = partial WM content at voxelxyz). The reduction of HU over WM-space in CT images was correlated with gold standard MR-based WM lesion volume measurements. Results were compared with rater-based Fazekas scores for severity of WM disease Results: The process of CT-based tissue-specific segmentation was reliable in 103 cases with varying occurrence of microangiopathy. In comparison with MRI FLAIR-based WM-lesion volume, the CT-based HU-weighted reduction of the white matter showed a significant correlation coefficient (0.87). cord and CSF flow artefacts were graded by consensus of 2 experienced readers in comparison to the TSE sequence. Results: The basic BLADE version with 1 or 2 concatenations was significantly inferior to TSE (2-sided Wilcoxon test, P < 0.05). Using additional flow compensation or an increased k-space coverage resulted in no significant differences of BLADE compared with TSE -with a minor advantage in favour of the BLADE technique with increased k-space coverage. Conclusion: The value of the BLADE technique for artefact reduction in transverse imaging of the cervical spine is strongly dependent on dedicated parameter setting. We present a setting which might be promising for application in a patient study.Ablation of atrial flutter guided by magnetic resonance imaging M. Grothoff, P. Sommer, C. Piorkowski, J. Hoffmann, G. Hindricks, M. Gutberlet; Leipzig/DE (grothoff@gmx.de)    Purpose: Fluoroscopy-guided radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation is the standard therapy in atrial flutter and is associated with substantial radiation exposure. We introduce the method of RF ablation using real-time magnetic resonance (MR) guidance. Methods and Materials: RF ablation was performed in 10 patients with typical atrial flutter in a standard 1.5 Tesla MRI. Fully MR compatible 8.5 F ablation catheters and an MR compatible electrophysiology (EP) recording system (Imricor Medical Systems, Burnsville, Minnesota) were used to map/ablate the cavotricuspid isthmus. MR-guidance was performed using a standard cine steady-state-free-precession real-time sequence with a frame-rate of 8/s for passive tracking in two orthogonal planes, comparable to right anterior oblique and left anterior oblique projections. Ablation was performed with RF pulses of 40 W and 60 seconds burning time. Postablation imaging was performed using T2-weighted and late gadolinium enhancement imaging for visualisation of oedema and necrosis. Results: Time in the MRI scanner was 72\u00b112 minutes. A total isthmus block could be achieved in one patient and was confirmed in the conventional EP environment. In the remaining 9 patients a partial isthmus block was verified. No adverse events occurred during the procedures or within the first 30 days to follow-up. Postablation imaging clearly showed oedema and necrosis of the cavotricuspid isthmus. Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility of MRI-guided cavotricuspid isthmus ablation using a standard 1.5 Tesla MRI and a standard real-time SSFP sequence for passive catheter tracking. Further development will concentrate on materials to optimise the steerability of the catheter.Quantitative BOLD response of the left ventricular myocardium to hyperoxic respiratory challenge at 1.5 T and 3.0 T cardiac magnetic resonance imaging S.

Methods and Materials: Sixteen of thirty-two MS patients that had plaque in the spinal cord and 16 that did not have plaque in the spinal cord were included. As a control group 16 healthy volunteered patients were integrated. All patients were examined via 3 T MR. DTI, dynamic MTI and conventional were obtained. ROI localisations were set as plaque, periplaque, normal-appearing spinal cord, from central/posterior and both lateral sides. Results: In MS patients with spinal plaque FA and MTR values were significantly decreased compared with periplaque (p=0.041, p=0.012), and normal-appearing cord (p=0.010, p < 0.0001). Comparisons of normal-appearing spinal cord among MS patients with/without spinal plaque and control group revealed a significant decrease of FA and MTR in MS patients with plaque (p < 0.01, and at significance limit in MS patients without plaque (p=0.051, p=0.050) compared with that of the control group. Conclusion: FA and MTR values alter in plaque and periplaque regions and even normal-appearing spinal cord which can be attributed to disease burden. DTI FA and MTR values seem to be a promising in assessment of spinal involvement in MS patients.(Bayer Pharma) or gadoterate meglumine (Guerbet Group) in a random order.",

Wicklein, C. Lange, H. Ittrich, U. Schumacher, G. Adam; Hamburg/ DE (j.salamon@uke.de) Purpose: This study's purpose was to analyse the influence of E-and P-selectins on the migratory pattern of magnetically labelled multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in E-/P-selectin deficient (KO) and wildtype (WT) mice using MRI and fluorescence microscopy. Methods and Materials: Murine MSC were labelled with fluorescent iron-oxide micro-particles and carboxyfluorescein succinidylester. The ability to bind selectins and the expression of typical MSC markers were assessed by flow cytometry. Labelled MSC were injected into KO-and WT-mice applying doses of 5 \u00d7 104 cells intracardially, 1 \u00d7 106 cells intravenously and 5 \u00d7 106 cells intraperitoneally. Mice underwent sequential MRI at 3.0 T using high-resolution T2* 3D and 2D coherent gradient-echo sequences and histological evaluation after 7 days. Results: Expression of typical MSC markers and binding abilities to E-/P-selectins were found similar after labelling. After intravenous cell injection in KO-mice significant SNR decrease was assessed solely in the liver from day 0 to 1; WT-mice revealed an increasing SNR decrease of liver, spleen and bone marrow within 7 days. After intraperitoneal injection no significant SNR changes were observed in KO-mice; WT-mice showed an increasing SNR decrease of liver, spleen and bone marrow within 7 days. After intracardiac injection multiple susceptibility artefacts could be detected no longer then day 4 in KO mice but persisted up to day 7 in WT-mice. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed MRI findings. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that MSC retain their binding ability to E-/P-selectins after magnetic labelling. E-/P-selectin deficiency in mice significantly alters the distribution of magnetically labelled MSC. DE (holger.haubenreisser@medma.uni-heidelberg.de) Purpose: To prospectively compare the image quality of cranial computed tomography (cCT) with thin slice widths using traditional filtered back projection (FBP) and sinogram-affirmed iterative image reconstruction (SAFIRE). Methods and Materials: 40 consecutive studies (19 men; 71.6\u00b116.6 years) referred for cCT were prospectively included. Each cranial CT raw data set was reconstructed with FBP and SAFIRE with decreasing slice widths (5 mm-1 mm). Objective image quality was assessed by measuring image noise in three predefined regions of the brain (white matter, thalamus, cerebellum) using identical regions of interest (ROIs). Subjective image quality was assessed by 2 experienced radiologists by ranking the reconstructed data sets with respect to overall image quality. The Mann-Whitney U-test and Cohen's Kappa were used for statistical analysis. Results: Image noise was statistically significantly reduced in all SAFIRE images at identical slice widths when compared to the images reconstructed with FBP (4.26\u00b10.43 HU vs. 7.67\u00b11.19 HU at 1 mm slice width) (p < 0.001). Mean signal attenuation for each region and slice width remained constant between the two reconstruction methods (p> 0.5). SNR was comparable between 1 mm SAFIRE images and 5 mm FBP images. Subjective image quality of SAFIRE images was rated consistently higher than that of the FBP images (p < 0.001). Interobserver agreement was excellent between both radiologists (Cohen's K = 0.79-0.86). Conclusion: Iterative image reconstruction significantly reduces image noise, while increasing image quality. In cCT this may be used to decrease slice width and thus reduce partial volume effects, which may lead to increased diagnostic accuracy. Purpose: The aim of our study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D MRI in the diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy in comparison with clinical and neurophysiological data. Methods and Materials: 32 patients with L5 or S1 monoradiculopathy caused by a posterolateral or intraforaminal disk herniation underwent MRI examination after preliminary clinical assessment and electromyography (EMG). We performed conventional spin-echo and 3D coronal FFE sequences with selective water excitation (ProSet imaging). Using 3D coronal FFE sequences indentation, swelling and tilting angle of the nerve root were evaluated. The tilting angle was compared with the asymptomatic contralateral side of the nerve root. All the data were processed using Epi Info 3.3 software (CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA) and were compared by means of Fisher exact test. Results: ProSet sequence revealed abnormal tilting angle in 18 patients (57.2 %; p < 0.05), monolateral swelling or indentation of roots and spinal nerves in 28 patients (85.7%; p < 0.001). In 10 patients EMG demonstrated an involvement of more than one nerve roots, whereas the ProSet revealed only one involved root. In 2 patients the nerve alterations were revealed only by EMG. Conclusion: EMG has an improved ability to highlight the early changes of the roots caused by mechanical and biochemical alterations due to compression. ProSet Imaging demonstrates high sensitivity in identifying the exact level of the involved root and can provide a useful tool to plan surgical treatments. Purpose: To investigate the utility of DTI in detecting nerve injury or neuropathic changes in proximal nerve segments in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Methods and Materials: Twenty-four age-matched individuals with (n=14) and without (n=10) peripheral neuropathy underwent DTI of a defined sciatic nerve segment. Patients and controls were evaluated by clinical examination and nerve conduction studies at baseline and six months after the initial DTI scan. Four patients were scheduled for a second scan six months after the initial MRI. Results: The mean FA value was significantly lower in sciatic nerves from patients with peripheral neuropathy as compared to controls. Sciatic nerve FA values positively correlated with clinical disability scores and electrophysiological parameters of axonal damage, i.e. the compound muscle action potential amplitudes of the peroneal and tibial nerve at baseline and six months after MRI scan. No correlation was found with axial and radial diffusivities. Conclusion: DTI-derived FA values are a sensitive measure to discriminate healthy from functionally impaired human sciatic nerve segments. This technique might be potentially useful in estimating the proximal axonal degeneration burden in patients with peripheral neuropathies. Purpose: The purpose is to describe the imaging features of the involved brainstem and spinal cord tracts in cases of leukodystrophy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and brain lactate elevation (LBSL).",

In this feasibility study, we used a single-rotation of the C-arm (Artis zee biplane, Siemens AG, Healthcare Sector, Germany) accompanied by cardiac pacing acquiring a reduced number of low-dose projections (~100-400 Purpose: To demonstrate that myocardial microvessels detection is feasible at high-resolution susceptibility-weighted MR imaging (SWI). Methods and Materials: Fourteen Wistar rats underwent ex vivo cardiac MR imaging on a 4.7 Tesla scanner using a cryogenic device. Thin, tubular hypointensities within the myocardium of normal rat hearts at high-resolution susceptibility-weighted MR imaging (group 1, n=6) were presumed to be intramyocardial microvessels.To prove that these \"strand-like\" structures were microvessels, a reference map of the myocardial macrovessels (group 2, n=4) after direct intracoronary injection of barium sulphate, a viscous contrast media was defined. Then, a superparamagnetic contrast agent (ferumoxsil, Lumirem \u00ae), an intravascular contrast agent, was injected to stack up the distribution of intramyocardial microvessels (group 3, n=4). For groups 2 and 3, 3D fast imaging with steady state in precession (3D FISP) sequences was performed. The results of images in group 1 (spatial resolution: 39 \u03bcm) and group 3 (spatial resolution: 39x39x39 \u03bcm 3 ) were qualitatively compared. Results: After intracoronary artery injection of barium sulphate, the main coronary arteries were visible up to the third-order branches (group 2). Beyond this level, the coronary microvasculature was opacified with ferumoxsil (group 3) as demonstrated by the presence of ferumoxsil inside the microvessels on MR-matched histological sections. The regional distribution of microvessels was similar between groups 1 and 3. Conclusion: Myocardial microvessels appear as \"strand-like\" structures on highresolution MRI without injection of contrast media. This provides new methods for evaluation of neovascularization in preclinical models of myocardial infarction. Purpose: To prospectively compare the image quality and homogeneity of cardiac T2-weighted dark blood images using a dual-source parallel radiofrequency (RF) transmission MR system with RF shimming at 3.0 T and conventional MR imaging at 3.0 T. Methods and Materials: Dual-source parallel RF transmission 3.0 T MR system with local RF shimming was used to obtain T2-weighted dark blood images in 31 patients and compared with standard MRI at 3.0 T. SNR was determined in the interventricular septum (IS), the lateral wall (LW), the right ventricular cavity (RV) and left ventricular cavity (LV) in the anterior wall (AW), posterior wall (PW) and in the left ventricular cavity (LV) in two-chamber orientation.

One patient had to be excluded due to insufficient data quality. Two readers trained in different institutions independently assessed lesion morphology and enhancement kinetics and classified them according to BI-RADS. Lesion size, localisation and image quality were assessed. Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and interrater agreement (kappa statistics) were calculated for both observers. The histopathological diagnoses were used as the standard of reference. Results: There were three benign and 21 malignant lesions. Mean histopathological size was 25 mm (range 8-51 mm). On the basis of lesion morphology and enhancement patterns, all lesions were correctly classified as benign (n=3) and malignant (n=21) by 7T CE-MRI.

Oraevsky 3 ; 1 San Antonio, TX/US, 2 Southborough, MA/US, 3 Houston, TX/US (ottop@uthscsa.edu)Purpose: A novel system called Imagio combines ultrasound and opto-acoustics (OA) to more accurately distinguish malignant from benign tumours. We analysed readers' ability to assess probability of malignancy (POM) using OA versus conventional diagnostic ultrasound (DUS) alone. Methods and Materials: 73 patients with breast masses were assessed with OA and DUS. All the masses were biopsied. Histology was the gold standard. OA employs near-infrared laser pulses at two different wavelengths (to provide contrast between oxygenated haemoglobin in benign lesions and de-oxygenated haemoglobin in malignant lesions) to illuminate tissues through a fibreoptic bundle incorporated into a prototype duplex hand-held ultrasound probe. It detects the laser-generated ultrasonic pressure waves that are then used for reconstruction of two-dimensional OA images. OA maps of total haemoglobin and blood oxygen Purpose: To assess metabolic imaging of breast tumours with breast 18 F-FDG PET-CT and compare it with 3 T CE-MRI. Methods and Materials: 159 suspicious breast lesions were included in this IRB-approved prospective study. All patients were examined with 18 F-FDG PET-CT and 3 T CE-MRI of the breast. The MRI protocol consisted of a T2-w and a contrast-enhanced high-resolution 3D-T1-w sequence with a single dose of contrast agent (Dotarem\u00ae, Guerbet). All patients were subjected to prone 18 F-FDG PET-CT scanning. CT data were used for attenuation correction. Breast PET-CT was assessed for 18 F-FDG-avidity of lesions. Tumours were classified as positive when 18 F-FDG-uptake was greater than blood-pool activity. Lesions within tissues demonstrating moderate/high physiologic background activity were considered positive if the activity was greater than the adjacent physiologic activity. 3 T CE-MRI was assessed for lesion morphology and enhancement kinetics and classified according to BI-RADS\u00ae. All lesions were histopathologically verified. Results: PET-CT had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 76% and diagnostic accuracy of 90%. CE-MRI had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 80% and a diagnostic accuracy of 94%. There were 46 benign and 113 malignant lesions (mean lesion size 26.03 mm; range 5-90 mm). The 5 false-negative lesions in PET-CT were small lesions (mean 11.2 mm), had a very low SUV (mean SUVmax 1.59) or were adjacent to tissue with high physiologic activity or low grade IDCs. Conclusion: 3 T CE-MRI is superior to PET-CT for assessment of breast lesions, but dedicated breast PET-CT is a valid alternative in patients, who are unsuitable for MRI.",

Methods and Materials: Sixteen CRA breast lesions, mean size 2.4 (range 0.8-6.7 cm) in thirteen consecutive patients, mean age 52 (36-81) with core-needle biopsy-proven breast carcinoma and bone metastases were enrolled in this study. 10 patients had one lesion and three patients had 2 lesions. Under local anaesthesia and mild conscious sedation, the tumour and surrounding breast tissue were ablated with percutaneous CT-guided CRA. Cryoablation consisted of 2 cycles each of 10 minutes of freezing followed by a 4-min active thawing phase and a 4-min passive thawing phase for each one. Ten patients underwent one CRA session and two patients 2 CRA sessions. One patient is treated with two sessions for the same lesion. Results: All CRA sessions were successfully completed and all breast tumours were ablated. Morbidity consists in transient and mild ecchymotic changes and post-procedural oedema seen in two cases and alteration in skin pigmentation seen in the point of insertion of the cryoprobes in other two cases. The therapeutic outcomes were evaluated by contrast-enhanced TC or MRI at 1-, 3-and 6-month interval. Purpose: Stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy (VABB) is the first choice technique to characterise suspicious microcalcification clusters; however, considerable proportion of understaged invasive cancer (IDC) at subsequent surgical histology has been reported. BLES, thanks to a radiofrequency excisional system, remove a larger not fragmented histological sample (25x20 mm, weight 3 g). Our aim was to prospectively assess BLES diagnostic and eventually therapeutic efficiency in a selected cohort of patients with suspicious microcalcification cluster. Methods and Materials: From September 2010, patients with small microcalcification cluster, < 1 cm, staged 4a-4b according to BI-RADS classification system, were proposed for excisional biopsy with BLES. Written informed consent was obtained.Results: Up to now, 80 patients underwent BLES at our centre; 32 of them (40%) had malignant lesion, 7 were IDC and 25 (78%) in-situ (DCIS) carcinoma. Rationale of the study was to completely remove microcalcification clusters, obtaining enough surrounding tissue for histological margins' evaluation. Complete histological concordance was obtained in 100% of atypical hyperplasia. All patients with DCIS underwent surgical excision: upgrading to IDC resulted in only 3/25 (12% underestimation proportion); among DCIS cases, surgical excision demonstrated complete removal of the lesion by BLES in 18/25 patients (72%). Conclusion: In our experience, BLES is a valid, simple and safe alternative to VABB, providing better diagnostic performance evaluated as histologic accuracy with lower underestimation rate compared to previously reported for VABB. In selected cases, particularly in small microcalcification clusters, BLES may represent an interesting new therapeutic strategy considering the high rate of complete lesion removal.",

Methods and Materials: 144 screening radiologists were invited to voluntarily complete a test set of 60 screening mammograms. The following grading criteria were assigned regarding the most suspicious lesion: location, level of suspicion, BI-RADS, laterality, type (well defined mass, ill defined mass, spiculated mass, microcalcification clusters, architectural distortion and asymmetric density) and mammographic density are assigned. Also, several reader characteristics, such as years of experience and number of cases read per year, were to be completed. Case and lesion sensitivity and specificity were determined for all readers. The spearman correlation coefficient was used to determine correlation between reader characteristics and performance measured by the area under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: 112 radiologists completed the test set (78%). The mean age was 49 (range 33-68) and on radiologists read on average 10,000 (range 700-60,000) screening mammograms per year. The median AUC value was 0.91, case sensitivity 91%, lesion sensitivity was 91% and specificity 94%. The AUC was not correlated to reader characteristics. The test-set revealed interobserver variation in assigning lesion types. Conclusion: Overall, a good performance was seen among all screening radiologists. Readers are able to determine their educational needs and compare it with peers during training or audits. It is therefore a useful quality assurance tool.

During 1-year follow-up, radiology reports, surgical correspondence and pathology reports of each referred woman were collected. Results: The overall positive predictive value (PPV) of referral was 37.3% at analogue screening and 22.0% at digital screening (P < 0.001). Among women who had only been assessed by analogue screens, 37 (0.9% of referrals) had been referred twice for the same lesion. These referrals included 13 malignancies (PPV 32.4%).

Data on screening outcomes are assessed and a on statistical significance and clinical relevance are: age, mass, calcifications, parenchymal deformity and asymmetric density. Conclusion: With our nomogram we developed a tool to assist screening radiologists in determining the chance of malignancy based on mammographic findings. We propose cut-off values for assigning BI-RADS categories in the Dutch screening setting based on our nomogram which will need to be validated in future research.

The recall rate (RR), biopsy rate (BR), cancer detection rate (CDR), sensitivity and specificity of ABVS and MM screening were analysed. Results: Based upon MM, 28 patients were recalled for further examination (RR=12%). With ABVS 12 of these patients were also recalled, as well as 17 other women. Consequently, the RR increased to 45/234. Biopsies were deemed necessary in 21 patients after MM and increased to 26 with ABVS added, an increase from 9%-11%. 17 additional ABVS findings were resolved with targeted ultrasound. In total 4 cancers were found by MM (CDR 1.7%, sensitivity 100%, specificity 89%). Two of these cancers were also detected by ABVS (CDR 0.9%, sensitivity 50% specificity 88%). The two missed cancers were retrospectively visible, but misinterpreted due to post-operative scarring. Conclusion: Adding ABVS to high-risk MM screening increased RR and BR at baseline. Whether these negative effects are reduced when radiologists gain more experience and whether they are balanced by earlier detection of breast cancer due to the six-month interval of ABVS remain to be determined.radiological review is performed (40 interval cancers, 40 screen detected stage-II cancers and 40 consecutive recalled cases). The audit is completed with a report, summarising the results and giving recommendations. This study compares four audit series (1996-2000/2001-2005/2003-2007/2010-2011) . Results: Recall rates (subsequent screens) increased from 6, 10, 12 to 14 per 1000, respectively, in the four series. Detection rates also increased from 3.3, 4.3, 4.7 to 5.7 per 1000. Distribution of tumour size and lymph-node status of invasive tumours remained stable (p=0.4). The percentage interval and screen-detected stage II cancers classified as \"missed\" during the review did not change (22% to 25%, p=0.1).

Purpose of this study was to determine how often surgical consultation in women with a positive screening mammogram could be avoided by a radiological pre-assessment.

Data were prospectively collected by a senior breast radiologist. In-hospital follow-up data were available till September 2012. Descriptive statistics were used. Percentage of patients only assessed by a radiologist was determined. Negative predictive value for malignancy was calculated from the in-hospital follow-up. Results: 427 of 1014 women (42%) were only assessed at the radiology department without further surgical consultation. During follow-up, 8 of these 427 women (2%) developed a malignancy in the same breast. At least 6 of these malignancies were located at a different location than the original screening findings which led to the initial referral. The estimated negative predictive value for malignancy was 99.5%. Conclusion: By referring women with a positive screening mammogram to the radiology department for a pre-assessment, a surgical consultation was avoided in 42%, with an estimated negative predictive value for malignancy of 99.5%. Purpose: To determine the ability of T1 mapping of liver on Gd-EOB-DTPAenhanced MR imaging (MRI) for estimating liver function and to compare the estimated liver function to the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Methods and Materials: 24 patients underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI on a 3 T system. Patients were classified into two groups: MELD score < 9 (n=15) and MELD score \u00b39 (n=9). Two TurboFLASH sequences (TI = 400 ms, 1000 ms) were acquired before and 20 minutes after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration to obtain T1 maps. T1 relaxation times were determined indicating Gd-EOB-DTPA liver-uptake and correlated to the MELD score. Results: Significant changes between T1 relaxation times of non-enhanced MRI (794 ms \u00b1136 ms) and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI (351 ms \u00b1 141 ms) were observed (p < 0.001). T1 relaxation time for non-enhanced MRI showed no significant differences (p=0.387) between the group with MELD score < 9 (776 ms \u00b1 157 ms) and the group with MELD score \u00b39 (824 ms \u00b1 90 ms). After administration of Gd-EOB-DTPA T1 relaxation time of patients with MELD score < 9 (284 ms \u00b1 104 ms) and patients with MELD score \u00b39 (465 ms \u00b1123 ms) shows a significant difference (p=0.002). The shortening of T1 relaxation time was significantly lower for patients with a higher MELD score (p=0.002). Conclusion: Patients with advanced liver disease showed significantly lower changes in T1 mapping. Therefore, evaluation of changes in T1 mapping of the liver parenchyma may serve as a useful method to determine whole liver function, to improve the estimation of segmental liver function and finally to define the grade of liver disease.",

As regards to 23 patients who underwent CT before the initiation of AMD administration, the medication periods and total administered doses of AMD were compared with changes in CTL.Results: There was a mild correlation between CTL and mean medication period (p=0.0238, r=0.337). There was a strong correlation between CTL and serum level of AMD (p < 0.0001, r=0.699), whereas there was a moderate correlation between CTL and serum level of drugs (AMD) (p < 0.0001, r=0.574).

The highest average contribution is from CT, 56 %. From plain radiography, fluoroscopy and interventional radiology the proportional fractions are 19%, 17% and 7.5 % respectively. From diagnostic nuclear medicine procedures, the estimated mean effective dose per caput is 0.036 mSv. Heart and bone examinations contribute 40% and 36%, respectively. Conclusion: There were high variations between countries in frequencies (for example, in thorax radiography about ten-fold between Spain or Portugal and Germany) and typical effective doses (for example, in CT head four-fold between Denmark and Luxembourg). This presentation will review the available data in Europe using graphs in which countries can be identified. Furthermore, the procedures contributing most to the population dose are highlighted. Purpose: To assess the feasibility of the volumetric estimation of the left liver lobe, with 3D ultrasound, with MRI comparison and surgical specimen. Methods and Materials: The data of 19 consecutive patients referred for giving their left liver lobe to a child were reviewed (living donor transplantation program). The measurements of the 3D volumes of the segments II and III were performed retrospectively with comparison of the same evaluation performed with MRI (the reference and routine technique for the preoperative assessment of the liver size). All the examinations were done twice by 2 experts radiologists and radiologists in training. The results were statistically analysed (variance test, Gage R&R and Bland-Altman). 3D and MRI measurements were compared and related to surgically proved volume quantification. Results: Intra-and inter-observators reproducibility was poorly conclusive (for US and MRI): gage R&R analysis is related to a PRR of 57% for US and 54% for MRI. Bland-Altman analysis was giving an underestimation of volume measurements with US (bias from -11 ml to -44 ml). Agreement limits (-1.96SD to +1.96SD) for the 4 observators were included between -174.3 ml and +103 ml (from -71.6% to + 43.5%). Conclusion: Correct estimation of the left liver lobe volume performed with 3D or MRI is related to a low repeatability and a low reproducibility for both techniques.",

Drenth; Nijmegen/NL (melissachrispijn@gmail.com)Purpose: Polycystic liver disease (PLD) patients have severe hepatomegaly. Primary aim of treatment is total liver volume (TLV) reduction. The gold standard to assess TLV is CT volumetry which involves manual delineating of the liver outline. This is time consuming and requires expertise. There is a clear need for an easy and fast approach to estimate TLV in routine practice. Methods and Materials: All PLD patients with \u00b31 CT scan were considered for inclusion. We measured the liver in transverse (T), anterioposterior (AP) and craniocaudal (CC) directions and performed CT liver volumetry. We had access to an inception and a replication cohort. We performed multiple linear regression to predict TLV using the three dimensions in the inception cohort. Liver volumes were transformed logarithmically. The goodness of fit of the prediction model was assessed and stated as R 2 . Finally, we validated the prediction model in our replication cohort. Results: The inception cohort included 54 PLD patients (median TLV 3890 mL (range 1084-13611 mL)). All three diameters were significantly correlated with TLV (p < 0.001). The linear regression model resulted in the following formula: predicted TLV = 4,179+(0.009*T)+(0.007*AP)+(0.001*CC). Our model predicted TLV accurately in the inception cohort (R 2 =0.907 ",

The purpose of this study was to generate and to validate whole body voxel models using the patient CT images extended by established voxel phantoms. Methods and Materials: Measurements were performed on a SOMATOM Definition Flash scanner (Siemens, Forchheim, Germany) using the anthropomorphic Rando-Alderson phantom. The absorbed dose was measured using a set of 90 calibrated thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) chips for thorax protocols with tube voltage of 80, 100 and 120 kV. Whole body voxel models were built as a combination of the patient CT images and the ICRP Adult Male Reference voxel phantom. MC simulations were performed using the ImpactMC software (CT Imaging GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) for only the scanned volume and for the combined whole body model. Measured and simulated dose values were compared for each TLD chip. Results: At 120 kV, the dose values obtained by MC simulations based on only CT images differed from TLD measurements by 19% on average with a maximum difference of 37% for the border slices, while the whole body model allowed for a mean difference of 6%. The difference between measured and calculated results was reduced by 53%, 60% and 68% for 80, 100 and 120 kV, respectively, when using the whole body voxel model instead of the CT-scanned volume only.",

Purpose: The combined availability of DICOM radiation dose structured report and active personal dosimeters in interventional radiology (IR) can support the optimisation of radiation protection, both of patient and staff. Methods and Materials: For nine months, interventionalists performing interventional cardiology procedures have used a personal active dosimeter (DoseAware, Philips) worn over the apron. Information is displayed in real-time and transmitted to a database. The patient dosimetry report (Allura FD10, Philips) has been also automatically collected for all procedures.

We examined whether skin AF is increased in subclinical atherosclerosis and whether it is associated with the degree of atherosclerosis independent of diabetes and renal function. Methods and Materials: Cross-sectional study of 223 patients referred for primary (PP;N=163) or secondary (SP;N=60) prevention. Skin AF was measured using the AGE-reader and the degree of atherosclerosis was assessed based on ultrasonographically detected plaques in carotid and femoral arteries (in PP only), and computed tomography-derived coronary artery calcium score (CACS .12], respectively; P = 0.005 and < 0.001). In controls and PAD, skin AF was higher in those with CRP above median compared with below. In a multiple regression analysis, the association of skin AF with the 3 atherosclerosis categories was independent of age, gender, diabetes, Framingham Risk score, and kidney function. Conclusion: Skin AF is increased in subjects with subclinical and clinical atherosclerosis, independently of known confounders.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the metabolic changes within the normal appearing brain in children with GHD using MR spectroscopy (MRS) and to correlate MRS measurements with hormonal concentrations. Methods and Materials: Seventy-one children with GHD (mean age 6.9 yrs) and 11 healthy controls (mean age 8.4 yrs) were enrolled in the study. The MRS examinations were performed on 1.5 T scanner. Voxels were located in the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and the left parietal white matter (PWM). The NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and mI/Cr ratios were analysed in both groups. There were also evaluated correlations between the metabolite ratios and hormonal concentrations: growth hormone (GH) in two stimulation tests and GH during the night, as well as IGF-1 (insulinlike growth factor) and IGFBP3 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein) levels.Results: There was statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease of the NAA/Cr ratios in PCG and PWM in children with GHD compared to the normal subjects. Other metabolite ratios showed no significant differences. We found also statistically significant positive correlations between NAA/Cr ratio in PWM and IGFBP3 level, as well as GH concentration in stimulation test with glucagon.",

The alterations involving the cerebral cortex associated in various degrees with subcortical white matter abnormalities often affect the projection white matter tracts. The white matter in cortical brain abnormalities is evaluated with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). Methods and Materials: 65 patients (1year-14year range) 39 males and 26 females) with different pattern of cortical alterations were studied. The DTI data was processed in FSL. For each DTI exam, brain extraction only of images with b value equal to zero was performed so that a mask of entire brain was created. ",

Methods and Materials: Twenty-four malignant liver lesions (fourteen small HCC and ten metastatic lesions) and twelve benign lesions (five FNH, four adenomas and three regenerative nodules in cirrhotic liver) were studied. A retrospective evaluation was made. The qualitative analysis was obtained by the evaluation of two radiologists of the lesions's signal intensity compared with that of the surrounding liver parenchyma on hepatobiliary phase images and DWI (b-value=600s/mm2). The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and relative contrast enhancement of lesions on hepatobiliary phase images and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were assessed (by ROIs) for quantitative analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by the Mann-Whitney U test. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Talakic Purpose: To evaluate observer performance involving absolute visual grading analysis of image criteria using visual grading characteristic curves (VGC) and ordinal regression analysis during CT examination optimisation. Methods and Materials: Images obtained from current and optimised head CT protocols (n=120) from 4 suites were presented using ViewDex on Advantage Workstations for evaluation by radiologists (n=6), grading the visibility of anatomical structures sourced from the European guidelines on quality criteria for CT. Results: VGC analysis in terms of the area under the curve showed no significant differences (p> 0.05) from the 0.5 threshold value, indicating similar image quality between data sets. Ordinal regression analysis indicated no significant (p> 0.05) change in image quality in suites 1 and 3 but discriminated between the data sets for suite 2 and 4 (p < 0.05). Analysis on individual criteria indicated a difference (p < 0.05) in image quality between the protocols for all criteria in suite 2 but no difference (p> 0.05) in suite 4. Discussion: VGC curves demonstrated general trends between protocols. Findings of ordinal regression analysis not only indicate significant differences in image quality but also identify specific anatomical criteria contributing to those differences. The importance of selecting the most appropriate method of analysis in optimisation techniques is highlighted as findings influence protocol implementation based on clinical requirements. Conclusion: An overall 15% radiation dose saving was achieved as a result of optimisation of the head CT protocols. Optimised protocols were implemented for initial diagnosis for three suites and only for follow-up cases excluding initial diagnosis for the remaining suite.14:00 ",

Saito 1 , J.R. Ledsam 2 , S.P. Sourbron 2 , T. Hashimoto 1 , Y. Araki 1 , S. Akata 1 , K. Tokuuye 1 ; 1 Tokyo/JP, 2 Leeds/ UK (um07jrl@leeds.ac.uk) Purpose: To investigate if tracer kinetic modelling of low temporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI with gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) has the potential to replace technetium 99m galactosyl human serum albumin (GSA) scintigraphy and indocyanine green (ICG) retention for the measurement of liver functional reserve. Methods and Methods: 28 patients (18 males, 10 females; mean age 67y) awaiting liver resection for various cancers underwent DCEMRI, GSA-scintigraphy and ICG as part of routine pre-operative evaluation. Examinations were conducted within a single month. Underlying liver disease was present in 4 patients. The Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI sequence acquired 5 images: pre-contrast, double arterial phase, portal phase, and 4 minutes after injection. GSA-scintigraphy images were acquired every 10s following contrast injection. Contrast uptake rate (UR) and extracellular volume (Ve) were calculated from DCE-MRI, and the ratio of GSA radioactivity of liver to heart-plus-liver and percent of contrast uptake at 15 minutes (LHL15 and LU15, respectively) from GSA-scintigraphy. ICG retention at 15 minutes, Child-Pugh cirrhosis score (CPS) and post-operative Inuyama fibrosis biopsy criteria were also recorded. Statistical analysis was with SPSS17. Purpose: To investigate dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT) for monitoring the effects of regorafenib on experimental colon carcinomas in rats by quantitative assessments of tumour microcirculation parameters with immunohistochemical validation. Methods and Materials: Colon carcinoma xenografts (HT-29) implanted subcutaneously in female athymic rats (n=25) were imaged at baseline and after a one-week treatment with regorafenib by DCE-CT (128 slice dual source CT). The therapy group (n=13) received regorafenib daily (10 mg/kg bodyweight) via gavage. Quantitative parameters of tumour microcirculation (plasma flow, mL/100 mL/min), endothelial permeability (PS, mL/100 mL/min), and tumour vascularity (plasma volume, %) were calculated using a 2-compartment uptake model. DCE-CT parameters were validated with immunohistochemical assessments of tumour microvascular density (CD-31), tumour cell apoptosis (TUNEL), and proliferation (Ki-67). Results: Regorafenib significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed tumour perfusion (12.8\u00b12.3 to 8.8\u00b12.9 ml/100 ml/min) and tumour vascularity (15.7\u00b15.3 to 5.5\u00b13.5 ml/100 ml/min). Significantly lower microvascular density was observed in the therapy group (CD-31; 48\u00b110 vs. 113\u00b125, p < 0.05). In regorafenib-treated tumors, significantly more apoptotic cells (TUNEL; 11,844\u00b12,927 vs. 5,097\u00b13,463, p < 0.05) and significantly less proliferating cells (Ki-67; 4,277\u00b11017 vs. 4,841\u00b11,593, p < 0.05) were observed. DCE-CT tumour perfusion and tumour vascularity correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with microvascular density (CD-31; r=0.84 and 0.66) and inversely with apoptosis (TUNEL; r=-0.66 and -0.71).",

A test bolus was used to optimise the contrast injection protocol. Signal intensity of the liver parenchyma in all phases was defined using region-of-interest (ROI) measurements for enhancement calculation. Serum hepatic enzyme levels (bilirubin; cholinesterase, CHE; aspartat-aminotransferase, AST; alanine-aminotransferase, ALT; gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, GGT; alkaline phosphatase, AP) were available in all patients. Spearman correlation test was used to test the correlation between liver enhancement during the different phases and serum hepatic enzyme levels.Results: At late time points after contrast injection all serum hepatic enzymes were correlated with liver enhancement. Bilirubin and CHE showed stronger correlations than the other serum hepatic enzymes and they became correlated at earlier time points. The strongest correlation was observed between bilirubin and enhancement during the hepatobiliary phase and between CHE and enhancement during the hepatobiliary phase. Bilirubin showed negative and CHE showed positive correlation. The Spearman correlation coefficient was -0.64 for bilirubin and 0.61 for CHE. Conclusion: In gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI of the liver gadoxetic uptake during the hepatobiliary phase is strongest correlated with bilirubin and CHE serum levels, whereas the other serum hepatic enzymes show weak or moderate correlations. Purpose: Aim of the study is to evaluate the use of MRCP using hepatospecific contrast media (GD-EOB-DTBA) to confirm biliary leak suspect and treatment planning. Methods and Materials: 13 consecutive patients (7 males, 6 females -average age 64 years), during 13 months (April 2011 to May 2012) underwent MRCP study using GD-EOB-DTBA due to clinical suspect of biliary leak. Using an 1.5 T MRI scanner, T1-weighted 3D GRE pulse sequences before and in hepatospecific phase, after GD-EOB-DTBA injection, were performed. All patients with biliary leak underwent endoscopic, interventional radiology (IR) or surgical approach for treatment. Results: Biliary leak was clinically suspected in 13 patients and underwent abdominal surgery (7 laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 5 various hepatic resections, 1 resection of a pancreatic-duodenal mass) after 33 days (AV; range 4 to 107). In 11/13 biliary leak was found at 44 minutes (AV; range 20 to 76 minutes) from GD-EOB-DTBA injection, from intrahepatic ducts (6/11) site, cystic duct stump (2/11), both intrahepatic and principal biliary duct (2/11) and from a biliodigestive anastomosis (1/11). Biliary leak was confirmed and successfully treated by percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (8/11), endoscopic approach (1/11), IR and endoscopic \"rendez-vouz\" technique (1/11) and by surgical laparotomy (1/11). In 2/13 patients, no biliary leak was found and only clinical monitoring was performed, with good outcome. Any adverse reaction or technical problem occurred during the MRCP examination. Conclusion: MRCP with GD-EOB-DTBA is an high sensitivity, safe and fast examination to confirm the suspect and to locate precisely a biliary leak, concurring best planning for treatment.",

N-acetylcystein (NAC) has yielded some promising results recently in the prevention of CIN. In this study, the structural effects of NAC on CIN were analysed. Methods and Materials: Forty adult Wistar albino male rats were randomly allocated to four groups. The first group was the control group (n=9) which received only distilled water; second group was the contrast group (n=10) which received CM; the third group was the contrast plus NAC group (n=8) which received CM and was treated with NAC; and the last group was NAC group (n=10) which received only NAC. At the end of the 3 rd day, the right and left kidneys were removed and reserved for histopathological examination. All tissue sections were examined with light microscope looking for histopathological changes by the same experienced pathologist, without knowledge of the prior treatment. Histopathological examination was conducted in a blinded fashion, and glomerular injury scores, arteriolar injury scores and tubulointerstitial injury scores were calculated. Results: There was a significant difference among the scores of glomerular injury, arteriolar injury and tubulointerstitial injury in all groups (p < 0.05).The scores of glomerular, arteriolar and tubulointerstitial injury of the group-1 and group-4 were not significantly different from each other (p < 0.05).
