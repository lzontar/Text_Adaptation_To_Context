This overlapping ORF, which lacks an AUG codon near its 5\u00a2 end, spans from nucleotide 5 to nucleotide 485 and has a coding capacity of~160 amino acids. To investigate whether the 17 kDa protein is derived from this overlapping ORF, nucleotide 432 of the HCV-1 sequence coding for the core protein was converted from U to A to create a premature termination codon in the overlapping ORF ( Figure 1 ). This mutation removed the last 18 codons of the overlapping ORF without affecting the core protein-coding sequence. If the 17 kDa protein is derived from this overlapping ORF, then this mutation should reduce the size of the 17 kDa protein by~2 kDa without affecting the core protein. As shown in Figure 2A , the translation of the wild-type HCV-1 core protein RNA in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysates generated the 21 kDa core protein and the 17 kDa protein.",

Thus, the 17 kDa protein must be synthesized by initiation from a non-AUG codon or by frameshift after translation initiation from the AUG codon of the core protein sequence. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the coding sequence of the HA tag, a sequence derived from the in\u00afuenza virus hemagglutinin gene, was fused in-frame to the 5\u00a2 end of the core proteincoding sequence. If the 17 kDa protein is synthesized from a non-AUG codon located near the 5\u00a2 end of the core protein-coding sequence, then its synthesis should not be affected by the presence of the HA tag. On the contrary, if the 17 kDa protein is synthesized from the AUG codon of the core protein-coding sequence, then the HA tag should increase its size correspondingly. As shown in Figure 2B , the HA tag increased the size of both p21c and the 17 kDa protein by a similar amount. The presence of the HA tag in both p21c and the 17 kDa protein was veri\u00aeed by immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA antibody (data not shown). Thus, the results shown in Figure 2 indicate that the 17 kDa protein is synthesized from the initiation codon of the core protein sequence and terminates in the overlapping ORF.",

To investigate this possibility, we performed radiosequencing of p21c and F protein, which were synthesized in vitro in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine and [ 3 H]lysine. Few [ 35 S]methionine counts were detected in the \u00aerst sequencing cycle whether p21c or the F protein was sequenced ( Figure 3A and B; see also below), indicating the absence of the initiator methionine residue, presumably caused by the N-terminal peptidase activity in the translation extracts. As shown in Figure 3A , p21c generated three distinct [ 3 H]lysine peaks at sequencing cycles 5, 9 and 11. There are four lysine residues at amino acids 6, 9, 10 and 12 of the p21c sequence (including the initiating methionine as residue 1). Since Lys9 and Lys10 were not expected to be resolved into separate peaks in the sequencing reaction, the p21c sequencing result was in agreement with the predicted p21c sequence excluding the initiating methionine residue. The sequencing of the F protein generated [ 3 H]lysine peaks resembling those generated from the sequencing of p21c, except that the peak at cycle 11 had largely disappeared ( Figure 3B and C). Since the [ 3 H]lysine peak detected at cycle 9 was not affected, this result indicates that the sequences of p21c and the F protein diverge at or in the vicinity of codon 11, which thus predicts the location of the ribosomal frameshift.",

As shown in Figure 4B and C, a strong [ 35 S]methionine signal was detected in the \u00aerst sequencing cycle when either of these two proteins was sequenced. This result indicates that loss of the deleted sequences prevented the cleavage of the initiator methionine from these two proteins. A single [ 3 H]threonine peak was detected at sequencing cycle 10 when the larger protein was sequenced ( Figure 4B ). This result is consistent with the predicted sequence of the p21c deletion mutant, which contains a threonine residue at position 10 ( Figure 4B ). The sequencing of the smaller protein generated two [ 3 H]threonine peaks at sequencing cycles 6 and 9 ( Figure 4C ). The peaks in this case were broader than that seen in Figure 4B , suggesting a possible sequence heterogeneity. As mentioned above, the ribosomal frameshift site is predicted at or in the vicinity of codon 11 ( Figure 3) . A +1 ribosomal frameshift at codon 9, 10 or 11 would generate the sequence MQKKTNVTR, and at codon 12 would generate the sequence MQKKNNVTR at the N-terminus of the F protein mutant. The latter scenario does not appear likely since it would generate only one threonine residue at amino acid 8. In contrast, a \u00b12 ribosomal frameshift at codons 9, 10 or 11 would generate the sequence MQKKKTNVTR, and at codon 12 would generate the sequence MQKKNTNVTR, for the F protein mutant. Both sequences contain two threonine residues at amino acids 6 and 9. Thus, the [ 3 H]threonine sequencing result is consistent with the F protein being generated by a \u00b12 ribosomal frameshift. However, due to the possible sequence heterogeneity observed in Figure 4B , some F protein may also be generated by +1 ribosomal frameshift.",

To investigate further whether this sequence can also mediate ribosomal frameshift in liver cells, we have fused the \u00aerst 14 codons of the core protein sequence to the zero frame, the \u00b12/+1 frame and the \u00b11/+2 frame of the luciferase-coding sequence. The expression of the fused sequence was under the control of the EF1a gene promoter. These DNA constructs, named FS(0)Luc, FS(\u00b12/+1) and FS(\u00b11/+2), are illustrated in Figure 6A . While the FS(0)Luc construct is expected to express the luciferase reporter as a fusion protein to the core sequence, FS(\u00b12/+1)Luc can express the luciferase sequence only by \u00b12/+1 ribosomal frameshift. The FS(\u00b11/+2)Luc construct cannot express the luciferase sequence with or without ribosomal frameshift due to the presence of a termination codon in the \u00b11/+2 reading frame immediately upstream of the luciferase reporter sequence. This construct serves as a negative control. These DNA plasmids were then transfected into Huh7 cells, a well differentiated human hepatoma cell line. A human growth hormone (hGH) reporter plasmid was also co-transfected to serve as an internal control for monitoring the transfection ef\u00aeciency. As shown in Figure 6B , 1\u00b12% luciferase activity was expressed by the FS(\u00b12/+1)Luc construct relative to that expressed by the FS(0)Luc construct. In contrast, the FS(\u00b11/+2)Luc negative control produced~0.05% luciferase activity, which was near the background level. This result supports our observation that codons 1\u00b114 of the core protein sequence can indeed mediate the \u00b12/+1 ribosomal frameshift in Huh7 cells. This 1\u00b12% ef\u00aeciency of ribosomal frameshift is not unusual as it is similar to that which was reported previously for a number of genes (Grentzmann et al., 1998; Ivanov et al., 2000) .",

For that reason, we decided to look for F protein-reactive antibodies in HCV patients. As mentioned above, a stretch of 10 As is located between codons 8 and 11 of the core protein-coding sequence. A single A nucleotide was deleted from this stretch to generate an F protein analog composed of the \u00aerst 10 codons of the core protein sequence fused to the overlapping ORF. This F protein analog was synthesized in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine in vitro, and immunoprecipitated with the sera isolated from six HCV patients and \u00aeve hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients. As shown in Figure 7A , while none of the HBV sera immunoprecipitated the F protein analog, \u00aeve of the six HCV sera (i.e. from patients 1, 4, 7, 10 and 11) clearly reacted with the F protein, while the sixth (from patient 3) showed weak reactivity. Since the F protein analog contains a 10 residue sequence from the core protein, it was possible that the immunoreactivity seen in Figure 7A was due to the presence of anti-core antibodies that recognized these 10 residues.

Shorter forms ranging from 126 to 155 codons in length are also conserved in the great majority of the other HCV sequences reported.

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the long ORF in the HCV genomic RNA codes for a polyprotein, which is proteolytically cleaved by cellular and viral proteases to generate at least 10 viral protein products. In this report, we demonstrate that an additional protein is expressed from a coding sequence that overlaps the core proteincoding sequence. The constraint imposed by two overlapping coding sequences is probably the reason why the HCV core protein-coding sequence has an unusually low synonymous substitution rate (Ina et al., 1994) . The protein sequencing results shown in Figures 3 and 4 indicate that the F protein is synthesized by a \u00b12/+1 ribosomal frameshift. It is unlikely that the F protein was synthesized as a result of the RNA sequence heterogeneity generated by the T7 RNA polymerase, as direct sequencing of the HCV RNA did not reveal a one nucleotide deletion or a two nucleotide insertion, which is required for the synthesis of the F protein. We previously reported that the F protein could be expressed from the HCV-1 core protein sequence in Escherichia coli (Lo et al., 1995) . During the course of this study, we found that no detectable amount of the F protein could be expressed from the HCV-1 sequence in E.coli, and our previous result was caused by an unintended deletion of nucleotide 80, which fused the \u00aerst 26 codons of the core protein sequence to the overlapping ORF to produce a protein resembling the F protein. The inability of the F protein to be expressed in E.coli also argues against a role for T7 RNA polymerase in the expression of the F protein, since the expression of the core protein in E.coli in our studies was also controlled by the T7 promoter (Lo and Ou, 1998) . The ribosomal frameshift for the synthesis of the F protein is independent of the HCV internal ribosomal entry site (data not shown; see also Selby et al., 1993) . This ef\u00aeciency is~30% in vitro. In Huh7 cells, this ef\u00aeciency was determined to be~1\u00b12% using only codons 1\u00b114 of the core protein sequence. In our previous expression studies in mammalian cells, we found that the expressing ef\u00aeciency for the F protein was substantially higher than 2% (Lo et al., 1995 (Lo et al., , 1996 . Thus, it is likely that the nucleotide sequence downstream of codon 14 is important for increasing the ef\u00aeciency of ribosomal frameshift in cell cultures. Nevertheless, this 1\u00b12% ef\u00aeciency is not unusual. The ribosomal frameshifting ef\u00aeciency can range from 1 to 40% depending on the genes and the expressing systems used (Grentzmann et al., 1998; Ivanov et al., 2000) .",

For antizyme, this frameshift can be \u00b12, +1 or a mixture of both, depending on the host cells used for the expression studies (Ivanov et al., 1998) .

The conservation of this gene in different HCV isolates and its expression during natural HCV infection, as evidenced by the presence of its antibodies in patients, suggest that this protein plays an important role in the HCV life cycle. Our studies thus identify a new potential target for the development of anti-HCV therapies. Such therapies may take the form of molecules that prevent the function of the F protein itself, or that prevent the ribosomal frameshift event (Dinman et al., 1998) .",

This plasmid was constructed by inserting the HA-coding sequence TACCCATACGAC-GTCCCAGACTACGCT between the \u00aerst and the second codons of the core protein-coding sequence in pCMV-CC. pCMV-CCD2 was identical to pCMV-CC, except that codons 2\u00b17 and 15\u00b150 had been deleted from the HCV-1 core protein-coding sequence by PCR. pGEM-core9a contained core protein-coding sequence with one nucleotide deletion in the 10 A stretch spanning from codons 8 to 11. This core protein-coding sequence was inserted in the BamHI\u00b1HindIII site of the pGEM vector (Promega). For the construction of pET-orf, which expresses the truncated F protein, a C to G mutation was introduced at nucleotide 13 of the core protein-coding sequence to create a translation initiation codon for the overlapping ORF. This coding sequence was then isolated by PCR and cloned into the NdeI\u00b1BamHI site of the pET-3a vector (Lo and Ou, 1998) . The HCV sequences in all of the PCR-derived DNA constructs were veri\u00aeed by direct nucleotide sequencing. The luciferase reporter constructs were created by joining the \u00aere\u00afy luciferase-coding sequence to the 3\u00a2 end of the following sequence via the EcoRI site: 5\u00a2AACCTCAAACAGACACCATGAGCACGAATCCTA-AACCTCAAAAAAAAAACAAACGTAACGAATTC3\u00a2. The sequence underlined corresponds to codons 1\u00b114 of the core protein sequence and the sequence in italics indicates the EcoRI site. The hybrid sequence was cloned into the pCDEF vector under the expressing control of the EF1a promoter (Lu et al., 1999) . In pEF-FS(0)Luc, the luciferase reporter was fused to the same reading frame as the core protein sequence (i.e. the zero reading frame). In pEF-FS(\u00b12/+1)Luc, the luciferase reporter was fused to the +1 reading frame by the insertion of one nucleotide, C, after the EcoRI site.
