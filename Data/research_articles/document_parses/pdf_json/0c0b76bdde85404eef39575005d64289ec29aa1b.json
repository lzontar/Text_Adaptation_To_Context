Now, scientists can obtain a genome-wide perspective of cancer gene expression useful to discover novel cancer biomarkers for more accurate diagnosis and prognosis, and monitoring of treatment effectiveness. Thus, for instance, microRNA expression signatures have been shown to provide a more accurate method of classifying cancer subtypes than transcriptome profiling and allow classification of different stages in tumor progression, actually opening the field of personalized medicine (in which disease detection, diagnosis, and therapy are tailored to each individual's molecular profile) and predictive medicine (in which genetic and molecular information is used to predict disease development, progression, and clinical outcome). However, since these novel tools generate a tremendous amount of data and since the number of laboratories generating microarray data is rapidly growing, new bioinformatics strategies that promote the maximum utilization of such data, as well as methods for integrating gene ontology annotations with microarray data to improve candidate biomarker selection are necessary. In particular, the management and analysis of NGS data requires the development of informatics tools able to assemble, map, and interpret huge quantities of relatively or extremely short nucleotide sequence data.",

Breast can-Part F 32 cer is the most common malignancy in women with a cumulative lifetime risk of developing the disease as high as one in every eight women [32.1]. Several factors are associated with this cancer such as genetics, life style, menstrual and reproductive history, and long-term treatment with hormones. Until now breast cancer has been hypothesized to develop, following a progression model similar to that described for colon cancer [32.2, 3], through a linear histological progression from adenosis, to ductal/lobular hyperplasia, to atypical ductal/lobular hyperplasia, to in situ carcinoma and finally to invasive cancer, corresponding to increasingly worse patient outcome. Molecularly, it has been suggested that this process is accompanied by increasing alterations of the genes that encode for tumor suppressor proteins, nuclear transcription factors, cell cycle regulatory proteins, growth factors, and corresponding receptors, which provide a selective advantage for the outgrowth of mammary epithelial cell clones containing such mutations [32.4] .",

In particular, DNA microarray-based technology, with the simultaneous evaluation of thousands of genes, has provided researchers with an opportunity to perform comprehensive molecular and genetic profiling of breast cancer able to classify it into some clinically relevant subtypes and in the attempt to predict the prognosis or the response to treatment [32.5-8]. Unfortunately, the initial enthusiasm for the application of such an approach was tempered by the publication of several studies reporting contradictory results on the analysis of the same samples analyzed on different microarray platforms that arose the skepticism regarding the reliability and the reproducibility of this technique [32.9, 10]. In fact, despite the great theoretical potential for improving breast cancer management, the actual performance of predictors, built using genes' expression, is not as good as initially published, and the lists of genes obtained from different studies are highly unstable, resulting in disparate signatures with little overlap in their constituent genes. In addition, the biological role of individual genes in a signature, the equivalence of several signatures, and their relation to conventional prognostic factors are still unclear [32.11]. Even more incomplete and confusing is the information obtained when molecular genetics was applied to premalignant lesions; indeed, genome analysis revealed an unexpected morphological complexity of breast cancer, very far from the hypothesized multi-step linear process, but sug-gesting a series of stochastic genetic events leading to distinct and divergent pathways towards invasive breast cancer [32.12], the complexity of which limits the application of really effective strategies for prevention and early intervention.",

To do that, instead of studying the single aspects of tumor biology, such as gene mutation or gene expression profiling, we must apply an investigational approach aimed to integrate the different aspects (molecular, cellular, and supracellular) of breast tumorigenesis.",

When altered in their response to abnormal inputs from the local microenvironment, these stem/precursor cells can give rise to preneoplastic lesions [32.20]. In fact, similarly to bone marrow-derived stem cells, tissue-specific stem cells show remarkable Part F 32.1 plasticity within the microenvironment: they can enter a state of quiescence for decades (cell dormancy), but can become highly dynamic once activated by specific microenvironment stimuli from the surrounding stroma and are ultimately transformed in tumor initiating cells [32.21]. The stroma, in which the mammary gland is embedded, is composed of adipocytes, fibroblasts, blood vessels, and an extracellular matrix in which several cytokines and growth factors are present. While none of these cells are themselves malignant, they may acquire an abnormal phenotype and altered function due to their direct or indirect interaction with epithelial stem/precursor cells. Acting as an oncogenic agent, the stroma could provoke tumorigenicity in adjacent epithelial cells leading to the acquisition of genomic changes, at which epigenetic alterations also concur, that can accumulate over time and provoke silencing of more than 100 pivotal genes' encoding for proteins involved in tumor suppression, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and signal transduction [32.22] . Under these conditions, epithelial cells and the stroma co-evolve towards a transformed phenotype following a process that has not yet been worked out [32.23, 24].",

This is the case of hormone steroids (estradiol and progesterone), which are physiological regulators of breast development and whose dysregulation may result in preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions [32.25-27]. In fact, through their respective receptors, in epithelial cells estrogens and progesterone may induce the syn-thesis of local factors that, on the one hand, trigger the activation of the stem/precursor cells and, on the other hand, exert a paracrine effect on endothelial cells, which in response to the vascular endothelial growth factor, trigger neoangiogenesis activation [32.21]. In addition, estrogens have been found implicated in the local modifications of tissue homeostasis associated to a chronic inflammation that may promote epithelial transformation due to the continued production of pro-inflammatory factors that favors generation of a pro-growth environment and fosters cancer development [32.28]; alternatively, transformed epithelial cells would enhance activation of fibroblasts through a vicious circle that supports the hypothesis according to which cancer should be considered as a never healing wound. Last but not least, very recent findings in animal models have clearly indicated that an early event occurring in the activation of estrogen-induced mammary carcinogenesis is represented by the altered expression of some oncogenic microRNAs (oncomir), suggesting a functional link between hormone exposure and epigenomic control [32.29].",

Such an error is called type one error and its level is generally called \u03b1 and fixed at a 5% level. The problem is that a test at \u03b1 level is performed for each gene. Therefore, if the probability of making a mistake (FP) is 0.05, while the probability of not making a mistake is 0.95 (this is the probability of saying the gene is not differentially expressed when it is not, true negative), when performing, say, 1000 tests the probability of not making any mistake is 0.95 1000 , which is practically 0. Accordingly, the probability of at least one FP is practically 1. How can the specificity of the experiment be controlled?

The Bonferroni correction originates from this. In fact, if the tests are performed at level \u03b1 B = \u03b1/n, then we can expect to have no false positive among the genes declared differentially expressed at \u03b1 level. This is, in fact, at the cost of a large number of false positives. In genomic experiments, when thousands of tests are performed, the Bonferroni significance level is so low that very few genes can easily pass the first screening probably paying too high costs in terms of genes declared not significantly differentially expressed when actually they have a differential expression.

The type one error rate \u03b1 (FPR) controls the number of FP with respect to N, while using the Bonferroni correction the probability that FP is greater than 0 is controlled. The FDR changes perspective and considers the columns of the table instead of the rows. FDR controls the number of FP with respect to S. If, for example, 10 genes are declared differentially expressed with an FDR of 20%, it is expected that 2 be false positives. This may allow greater flexibility in the managing of the screening phase of the analysis (see Fig. 32 .3 for a graphical representation of results from a class comparison microarray study, with an application of FDR concepts).

Moreover, so far, a large amount of biostatistical methods and software tools supporting bioinformatics analysis of genomic/proteomic data has been provided but reference standardized analysis procedures coping with suitable preprocessing and quality control approaches on raw data coming from omic and multiplex assays are still waiting for development. Formal initiatives for the integration of biostatistical research groups with functional genomics and proteomics labs are one of the major challenges in this context. In fact, besides the development of innovative biostatistics and bioinformatics tools, a major key of success lies in the ability to integrate different competencies. Such an integration cannot be simply demanded for the development of software, such as the ArrayTrack initiative, but needs to develop integrated skills assisted by a software platform able to outline the analysis plan.

The identification of genes whose expression levels are associated with recurrence might also help better discriminating those subjects who are likely to respond to the various tailored systemic treatments. However, microarray experiments raised several questions to the statistical community about the design of the experiments, data acquisition and normalization, supervised and unsupervised analysis. All these issues are burdened by the fact that typically the number of genes being investigated far exceeds the number of patients. It is well-recognized that too large a number of predictor variables affects the performance of classification models: Bellman coined the term curse of dimensionality [32.52], referring to the fact that in the absence of simplifying assumptions, the sample size needed to estimate a function of several variables to a given degree of accuracy (i. e., to get a reasonably low-variance estimate) grows exponentially with the number of variables. To avoid this problem, feature selection and extraction issue play a crucial role in microarray analysis. This has led several researchers to find it judicious to filter out genes that do not change their expression level significantly, reducing the complexity of the data and improving the signal to noise ratio. However, the adopted measure of significance in filtering (the implicitly controlled error measure) is not often easy to interpret in terms of the simultaneous testing of thousands of genes. Moreover, gene expressions are usually filtered on a per-gene basis and seldom taking into account the correlation between different gene expressions. This filtering approach is commonly used in most current high-throughput experiments whose main objective is to detect differentially expressed genes (active genes) and, therefore, to generate hypotheses rather than to confirm them. All these methods, based on a measure of significance, select genes from a supervised perspective, i. e., accounting for the outcome of interest (the subject status). However, an unsupervised approach might be useful in order to reveal the pattern of associations among different genes making it possible to single out redundant information. The figure shows the data analysis pipeline developed in many papers dealing with expressions from high throughput experiments Integration and standardization of approaches for assessment of diagnostic and prognostic performance is a key issue. Many of the clinical and translational research groups have chosen different approaches for biodata modeling, tailored to specific types of medical data. However, very few proper benchmarking studies of algorithm classes have been performed worldwide and fewer examples of best practice guidelines have been produced. Similarly, few studies have closely examined the criteria under which medical decisions are made. The integrating aspects of this theme relates to methods and approaches for inference, diagnosis, prognosis, and general decision making in the presence of heterogeneous and uncertain data.",

Iron oxide constructs and colloidal gold nanoparticles can provide enhanced contrast for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging, respectively [32.70, 71]. QDs provide a plausible solution to the problems of optical in vivo imaging due to the tunable emission spectra in the near-infrared region, where light can easily penetrate through the body without harm and their inherent ability to resist bleaching [32.72]. For ultrasound imaging, contrast relies on impedance mismatch presented by materials that are more rigid or flexible than the surrounding tissue, such as metals, ceramics, or microbubbles [32.73]. Continued advancements of these nano-based contrast agents will allow clinicians to image the tumor environment with enhanced resolution for a deeper understanding of disease progression and tumor location.",

The identification of DNA alterations is crucial to better understand the mechanism of a disease such as cancer and to detect potential genomic markers for diagnosis and prognosis. Other studies have reported the development of a three-dimensional gold nanowire platform for the detection of mRNA with enhanced sensitivity from cellular and clinical samples. Highly sensitive electrochemical sensing systems use peptide nucleic acid probes to directly detect specific mRNA molecules without PCR amplification steps [32. Cantilever nanosensors have also been used to detect minute amount of protein biomarkers. Label-free resonant microcantilever systems have been developed to detect the ng/mL level of alpha-fetoprotein, a potential marker of hepatocarcinoma, providing an opportunity for early disease diagnosis and prognosis [32.95].

Another major challenge is to generate critical studies that can clearly link biomarkers with disease behaviors, such as the rate of tumor progression and different responses to surgery, radiation or drug therapy [32.99]. The current challenge is, therefore, related to the advancement of biostatistics and biocomputing techniques for the analysis of novel high-throughput biomarkers coming from nanotechnology applications. Current applications involve high-throughput analysis of gene expression data and for multiplexed molecular profiling of intact cells and tissue specimens. The advent of fast and low cost high-throughput diagnostic devices based on NGS approaches appears to be of critical relevance for improving the technology transfer to disease prevention and clinical strategies.",

Recent work on lung cancer highlighted different patterns of Cell lines labeled with olive green points (colon and ER+ breast cancer) are positively associated with the set of genes on the lower part of the right vertical axis, namely genes from CLDN15 and CDH1; on the other hand, cell lines labeled with light blue squares (renal lines and ER-breast cancer) are negatively associated with this set of genes, but show some mild positive association with genes on the left side of the upper horizontal axis, namely genes from CDH2 to ZYX expression between healthy subjects and mesoteliomaaffected subjects using multivariate visualization techniques and evaluated relationships between gene-sets involved in different biological pathways via partial least squares regression [32.40,41]. It is relevant to note that all of these methods will have to face relevant challenges, in the perspective of being applied in the context of NGS data, for which a considerable amount of issues has already arisen [32.42]. The use of multivariate techniques is thus a principled way for making it through the steps of data dimensionality reduction, data normalization, and integration, which can lead to higher chances of driving the exploration of distinct bioprofiles [32.43].",
