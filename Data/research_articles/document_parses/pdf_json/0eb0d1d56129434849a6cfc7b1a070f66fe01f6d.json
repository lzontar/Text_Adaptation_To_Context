Such treatment has been indeed associated with lower mortality in a pilot study treating 99/499 patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection 18 , also due to the intrinsic anti-inflammatory effect of LMWH 19,20 . Nevertheless, any consideration about a potential increased risk associated with altered coagulation tests still remains speculative and further large studies are needed to identify cut-off values or clinical scores useful for clinical practice. Even, D-dimer values are not fully useful to effectively identify PE due their significant baseline elevations. Rather, clinical findings, echocardiographic evidence of right heart strain or lower extremity ultrasound should guide the use of LMWH of unfractionated heparin (UFH) at anti-coagulant dose 17 .

Although this subset of patients displayed an increased mortality when admitted in the hospital for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the presence of a prior coronary heart disease did not reveal a significant odds ratio (in contrast to D-dimer levels and an older age) 4 . A further study better focusing on lipid profile similarly failed to provide any significant association 32 . Especially concerning lipid profile, those results are in contrast with previously reported in patients during seasonal influenza epidemic 33 , or various (bacterial) infections 34 . Also a large pooled data analysis (including data from MRFIT, Framingham, NORA cohorts, and other) show that respiratory disease accounted for 4% of total mortality with an inverse relationship between total cholesterol and noncancer non-cardiovascular death, subcategory respiratory diseases death 35 . Noteworthy, patients with the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (characterized by extreme low cholesterol phenotype) exert a less acting innate system, making them in theory more vulnerable for viral infections 36 . To date, no reports exist about any relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome and extreme low total cholesterol as occurring in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome or treatment with the extreme effective cholesterol lowering drugs, such as PCSK-9 inhibitors (i.e. alirocumab and evolocumab).",

Theoretically, it could be assumed that predisposing factors could make the endothelium more vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 infiltration and damage. As reported above, SARS-CoV-2 patients with troponin levels in the higher range (and less favourable outcomes) have higher triglyceride levels and -hypothetically -an overflow of circulating triglycerides with detrimental effect on endothelial biology, especially in the post-prandial state. Indeed, triglyceride rich particles (TRPs), especially when abundant in bloodstream may induce local inflammation (e.g. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6), activation of complement and coagulation cascade, ultimately promoting endothelial dysfunction 39,40 .",

Factors (such as the anaesthetic, etomidate) that could reduce clearance of TRPs from circulation -for instance by lessening of function from key enzymes that play a role in postprandial lipid homeostasis -could therefore give rise to a more aggravated postprandial lipemia. Such a pre-coating of the endothelium by TRPs may therefore lead to a more available endothelium for SARS-CoV-2 virus spread 42 .

As reported above, SARS-CoV-2 patients with troponin levels in the higher range (and less favourable outcomes) have higher triglyceride levels and -hypothetically -an overflow of circulating triglycerides with detrimental effect on endothelial biology, especially in the post-prandial state. Indeed, triglyceride rich particles (TRPs), especially when abundant in bloodstream may induce local inflammation (e.g. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6), activation of complement and coagulation cascade, ultimately promoting endothelial dysfunction 39, 40 .",

Factors (such as the anaesthetic, etomidate) that could reduce clearance of TRPs from circulation -for instance by lessening of function from key enzymes that play a role in postprandial lipid homeostasis -could therefore give rise to a more aggravated postprandial lipemia. Such a pre-coating of the endothelium by TRPs may therefore lead to a more available endothelium for SARS-CoV-2 virus spread 42 .

Hospitalized patients should then have coagulation tests performed at admission in order to identify stratify risk in swab-positive patients or even identify those yet \"unrecognized\". Although randomized clinical trials are still missing, there is a general agreement to treat all patients admitted with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at prophylactic dose 17 . Such treatment has been indeed associated with lower mortality in a pilot study treating 99/499 patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection 18 , also due to the intrinsic anti-inflammatory effect of LMWH 19,20 . Nevertheless, any consideration about a potential increased risk associated with altered coagulation tests still remains speculative and further large studies are needed to identify cut-off values or clinical scores useful for clinical practice. Even, D-dimer values are not fully useful to effectively identify PE due their significant baseline elevations. Rather, clinical findings, echocardiographic evidence of right heart strain or lower extremity ultrasound should guide the use of LMWH of unfractionated heparin (UFH) at anti-coagulant dose 17 . In reverse, identification and treatment of TMA still remain a challenge in clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection 8 .
