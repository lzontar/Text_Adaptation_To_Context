There may also be imaging evidence of active renal edema and inflammation [104]. Since renal dysfunction is early, an immunopathology response or direct viral injury may be contributing along with other systemic factors [20, 92]. Similar to other novel coronaviruses, renal involvement, acute or chronic, tends to associate with an adverse prognosis [22, 105, 107]. The COVID-19 virus has been detected in renal tissue and in the urine [39, 70, 108].

Algahtani et al. also report a case of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) attributable to disseminated intravascular coagulation and viral-induced autoimmune response [115].

Patients with pre-existing neurological diseases may also have a higher risk for encephalopathy and altered mental status[41]. As many as 36.4% patients have neurological symptoms, and these are seen more commonly in patients with severe disease[42].Acute cerebrovascular accidents, altered mental status, and myopathy occurred in approximately onethird of patients. In an observational series of 58 COVID-19 positive patients, Helms et al documented confusion and agitation as the most common neurologic symptoms. Corticospinal tract signs were also evident in nearly two-thirds of patients including increased deep tendon reflexes, ankle clonus, and bilateral extensor plantar reflexes [43]. One recent case report described acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy in a patient with COVID-19 infection [44]. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome has been observed after the onset of COVID-19 in a few patients presenting with lower-limb weakness and paresthesia as well as facial diplegia and ataxia [45]. Neurological involvement is present in more severely affected patients, and patients with central neurologic symptoms also had severe lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and uremia [42]. Patients with myopathy have a higher inflammatory response and a higher association with hepatic and renal disease [42]. Patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed leptomeningeal enhancement with bilateral frontotemporal hypoperfusion[43]. Electroencephalography showed mostly nonspecific changes with findings consistent with encephalopathy [43]. CSF analysis may show oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG levels, however, the significance of these findings is uncertain. Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 are garnering increasing attention. Animal studies show ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2), both established receptors for this virus, are expressed in the conjunctiva, although to a lesser extent than in the kidneys and lungs, and lesser in females [46]. A study reported conjunctivitis in as many as 31.6% patients, and more commonly in patients with severe disease [47]. It has also been reported as the sole initial presentation [48]. SARS CoV-2 has been isolated from conjunctival swabs in patients with ocular symptoms and reportedly detected for as many as 27 days after symptom onset [49]. Interestingly, an animal model has also shown that the conjunctival route may lead to systemic infection as well, but viral replication in the conjunctiva and chances of virus release into the bloodstream are very low [50].", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "[114].

A study on 121 hospitalized SARS-CoV patients found that tachycardia was the most frequent acute presentation followed by hypotension, bradycardia, reversible cardiomegaly, and transient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [34]. Case reports have described acute onset myocarditis in patients with SARS-CoV; however, on autopsy, the virus was absent in the myocardium, suggesting myocardial damage may be indirectly related to the illness [38, 39]. Another report described several fatal cases of SARS-CoV patients with acute heart failure and, rarely, myocardial infarction in the setting of septic shock with elevated myocardial enzymes [40] [41]. Chronic cardiometabolic damage may also ensue in some, even 12 years after recovery with dysregulated lipid metabolism [42].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": ". CK-MB and hs-cTnI were higher in ICU patients, suggesting that myocardial injury is more likely present in patients with severe disease[45, 46]. As many as 7% of deathsin COVID-19 patients have been attributed to myocardial injury [47]. Other cardiac manifestations include acute MI, fulminant heart failure, and dysrhythmias [48]. In some studies, arrhythmia with COVID-19 infection was as high as 17% [20, 45]. It is also important to note various drug interactions and the arrhythmogenic potential of medications often used in these patients. Additionally, patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and hypertension have been seen to suffer from more severe disease requiring critical care [48]. Presenting symptoms range from mild chest pain with preserved ejection fraction (EF) to profound cardiovascular collapse requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Echocardiography may show a regional wall motion abnormality or global hypokinesis with or without pericardial effusion [49, 50]. Initial electrocardiogram may show low voltage QRS complexes in the limb leads, ST segment elevations in leads I, II, aVL, V2-V6 and PR elevation and ST depressions in aVR [49, 50]. There should be a low threshold for SARS-CoV-2 testing in patients presenting with signs of myopericarditis even in the absence of fever and respiratory symptoms. Proposed mechanisms of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19 include overexpression of ACE2 in patients with chronic cardiovascular disease, cytokine storm triggered by an imbalanced response by type 1 and type 2 helper cells, hypoxemia resulting in myocardial damage, plaque rupture, coronary vasospasm, or direct vascular injury [22, 45, 51]. There may be a complex interplay between the accelerated immunologic dysregulation of the cytokines and T cells and the underlying cardiovascular or related metabolic conditions. Virally-induced systemic inflammation may also promote coronary plaque rupture and have a pro-coagulant effect necessitating the intensification of medical therapy[52].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": ". ACE2 receptors are also found on the hepatic endothelial cells [54]. On histopathology, SARS-CoV patients had a large number of virus particles in the hepatic parenchymal cells [38, 39, 55]. Elevated levels of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10 in patients with SARS-CoV hepatitis support coexisting acute inflammatory response [56]. Hepatic cell damage and cell-cycle disruption was seen on hepatic biopsy with apoptosis, mitotic arrest with eosinophilic bodies, and balloon-like hepatocytes [22]. Unfortunately, hepatic damage potentially due to antivirals use complicates our understanding of the etiology of hepatitis in patients with SARS-CoV [57]. Hepatic involvement may indicate a poor prognosis, particularly in patients with high LDH levels [58]. Yang et al. reported long-standing hyperglycemia (due to pancreatic injury) as an independent predictor for adverse outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV [58].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": ". The degree of hypoalbuminemia also helps to predict diseaseseverity [60]. Hepatic findings may resemble SARS-CoV-related changes [61]. However, MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase-4 to infect cells (DPP-4), which is highly expressed in the liver [62, 63]. In transgenic mice, the liver injury occurred within the first week after infection resulting in hepatic necrosis and infiltration of Kupffer cells and macrophages [64]. Similar to other coronavirus infections, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines are", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": ". Patients with abnormal LFTs present with a high degree of fever, and their degree of hepatic dysfunction correlates with length of hospitalization [66]. New reports suggest that the liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 may be related to damage to the cholangiocytes lining the biliary epithelium, likely due to the higher expression of ACE2 receptors on those cells [67]. Patients with preexisting metabolic fatty liver disease have been seen to have an about 6-fold higher chance of severe disease in the presence of coexisting obesity [21].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF5": {"text": ". Patients also complained of nausea, vomiting (14-22.2%) and abdominal pain (3.5-12.6%) [72]. The association between symptoms and outcomes had been mixed. Leung et al. found that patients with diarrhea had a higher likelihood of requiring ICU admission and ventilatory support [68]. Others found that GI symptoms at presentation conferred a better prognosis [69]. Others found no association between diarrhea and the development of ARDS or the requirement of ventilatory support [70]. The mechanism of GI symptoms is unclear, but SARS-CoV particles have been detected in saliva (100%), feces (97%), and mucosal epithelial and lymphoid tissue of affected patients with associated depletion of lymphoid tissue [72]. A significant mode of spread in community outbreaks was fecal-oral transmission [70, 73, 74].Patients with diarrhea also had a higher rate of positive serological and nasopharyngeal secretion tests[75]. The virus remained stable in stool up to 2 to 4 days, and may even be detectable as late as four", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "[20][21][22] 84]. Vomiting has been shown to be a more common presenting symptoms in children. The GI features seem to worsen with overall disease severity and the presence of abdominal pain has been associated with about 4 times higher odds of severe COVID[22, 24]. The delayed recognition of GI symptoms and lack of awareness may lead to a delay in seeking medical care[22]. Patients who present later during their illness were more likely to suffer from hepatic dysfunction but without a difference in mortality, ICU days, or time to discharge[22]. Patients with obesity are at significantly higher risk for severe disease requiring critical care and invasive mechanical ventilation. Compared with patients with a BMI <25 kg/m 2 , patients with BMI >35 kg/m 2 have been seen to have 7 times the odds for requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [25, 26]. COVID-19 virus enters enteric epithelial tissue through ACE 2 and transmembrane protease, serine 2, but the exact mechanism of GI symptoms is not known [85]. The virus is detectable in stool in up to half of COVID-19 patients [86, 87], and the feces remains positive for as much as four weeks [87]. ACE 2 and viral protein have been detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from feces[88]. Fecal PCR testing has been shown to be as accurate as PCR detection from a sputum sample, and in some cases, fecal PCR is positive before sputum PCR[88]. It remains unclear if the fecal-oral route is a significant mode of transmission.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF7": {"text": ". In most SARS-CoV patients, acute renal damage was not common at presentation[89]. However, acute renal failure was noted in 5-15% of patients and more often developed subsequently 7-20 days after presentation [89-92]. Choi et al. reported a 6% incidence of acute renal failure in a study of 267 patients, more commonly in elderly diabetics. A large study with 536 patients stated that patients with ARF had hyponatremia and hypoalbuminemia at the time of admission [75, 91]. Patients with renal dysfunction had mortality rates around 90% [75, 90, 91, 93, 94]. Patients with hypouricemia and chronic renal replacement therapy also had poor outcomes [95-97]. On microscopy, acute tubular necrosis has been observed in these patients [91]. Viral detection in the urine at the onset was rare but gradually increased with the disease progression and remained detectable up to 30 days after symptom onset [76, 98]. Xu et al. reported that six patients who died of SARS-CoV had testicular damage, which was also likely secondary to the immune response [99].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF8": {"text": "(median 6100 cells/mm3) [20, 21].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF9": {"text": "Fried JA, Ramasubbu K, Bhatt R, Topkara VK, Clerkin KJ, Horn E, Rabbani L, Brodie D, Jain SS, Kirtane A et al: The Variety of Cardiovascular Presentations of COVID-19.
