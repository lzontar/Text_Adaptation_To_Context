A Quantitative methodological approach was adopted which relied on the Partial Least Square approach to Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) for the statistical analysis. Seemingly, FOFL and FORD constructs were not seen to be a significant direct predictor of online purchase intention. However, the mediating effect of OSPCON for both FOFL and FORD towards online purchase intention in the Ghanaian context was found to be significant, hence the mediated-hypotheses were supported. Nonetheless, we have highlighted the need for additional and further research taking a cue from the study's limitations. The study contributes to our knowledge of how online identity theft practices lead to the unwillingness of online customers to embark on online transactions in an emerging economy, given the rampant outburst of online transactions in the developed world.

They have in their own unique way also introduced new challenges and concerns for users. Some of the challenges and concerns pertaining to the protection of the privacy and sensitive information of users of these technologies. Identity theft is a major example of such challenges faced by users of these technologies, as Cavoukian (2013) noted, identity theft is the fastest-growing form of consumer fraud in North America. The problem of identity theft is not peculiar to North America alone, several authors have reported a growing incidence of this problem around the world (Kahn and Li\u00f1ares-Zegarra 2016; Reyns 2013; Williams 2016) .

Consequently, the regimes of digital safety and security as informed by the threat of online identity theft that has become prevalent globally should not be merely viewed as a political reaction to the risks brought about by the proliferation of digital in society. Rather, online identity theft further constitutes an active threat and factor that influences consumers' purchase intentions especially in developing economies where proactive measures of protection are not particularly up to the standards obtainable in more advanced economies. Thus, where the incipient digital society is collectively reimagined, negotiated, and created. Therefore, online identity theft is an issue of major concern for online retailers of goods and services in these developing economy markets where the state of an emerging digital society and the sociotechnical relationships of checks and balances required to govern its emergence are in a constant state of transition (Haddad and Binder 2019) . Though the work by Jordan et al. (2018) replicated some constructs used in this present study to measure the impact of fear of identity theft, perceived risk in online purchase intentions; their work was not narrowed to measure the mediating role of online security and privacy concern that becomes the focal lens of this study. Moreover, their research was neither specific to young students in public higher institutions or to the more definite of an emerging economy's context considered in this paper. We further argue that given the varied and complex reasons manifesting in low levels of eCommerce transactions in the developing world, such as low level of internet penetrations, high levels of income poverty, a high rate of illiteracy, and infrastructural challenges that manifest in logistical inefficiencies even have a repelling effect on purchase intentions. Based on these insights, the current study aims at addressing the prognosis of online identity theft on consumer purchase intentions from a developing economy's perspective by (1) Evaluating the predictive influence of identity theft (FOFL and FORD) towards online transactions (2) Establishing the mediating role of online security and privacy concern (OSPCON) towards online purchase intentions/transactions.

(2018) , a major consequence of the emergence of the internet has been the rise in cybercrime which has accompanied its increasing use as a medium for transacting commercial activities through electronic means. Cybercrime manifests itself invariants that span across a broad range of criminal activities that leverage the electronic exchange of information of users. One of the most pervasive being the incidence of online identity theft which has led to victims suffering significant losses and harm which often leaves them traumatized both emotionally and financially. By applying widely available Internet tools, malicious actors trick unsuspecting computer users into divulging personal data, which is then exploited for illicit purposes, thereby causing mistrust of online payment and banking services (Venkatesh and Goyal 2010) These malicious individuals often apply techniques such as \"phishing\" and \"pharming\" as means of tricking their target victims, this is largely facilitated by the fact that because of the nature of the internet and other electronically mediated interactions, face-to-face contact between interacting parties does not exist or is reduced to the barest minimum.

According to Reyns (2013) , identity theft is the terminology used in describing the fraudulent use of an individual's personal information for criminal purposes and without the owner's consent. More specifically, Jordan et al. (2018) define online identity theft as an act of online fraud and crimes that involve the duplication of digital information or the high-jacking of online accounts for the purposes of committing identity fraud against individuals or businesses. Also, Cornelius (2016) defines online identity theft as the illicit use of another person's identifying facts for the perpetration of economic fraud or for masquerading another person's identity on the internet.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 112, "end": 124, "text": "(Smith 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 125, "end": 145, "text": "Wang and Huang 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 407, "end": 419, "text": "Reyns (2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 608, "end": 628, "text": "Jordan et al.

He comments that phishing attacks have risen in countries like India, which as of 2009 accounted for 15% of all malicious activity in the Asia-Pacific/Japan (APJ) region, increasing from 10% in 2008.

Also, Ladan (2014, p. 17) conducted research which reviewed recent developments in cyberlaw responses to cybercrime and cybersecurity in Nigeria and the economic community of West African States (ECOWAS), from the findings of his research, he established that \"online identity theft which includes the act of capturing another person's credentials and/or personal information via the Internet with the intent to fraudulently reuse it for criminal purposes is now one of the main threats to further deployment of e-government and e-business services in Nigeria and across the West African sub-region\".

This view is also supported by Mart\u00edn et al. (2011) who in their research focused on online shoppers in Portugal, explored the effect of trust on perceived benefits of online purchase, by looking at how security and privacy considerations of the online shoppers in Portugal influenced their trust levels and confidence to use the system. They found a causal relationship between users' perceptions of risk and their decision to trust the system, which ultimately influenced their purchase intentions along with the perceived benefits of using the system. Hence, based on evidence in order to extend the scope of understanding based on scientific evidence, the following hypothesis is proposed as a basis to investigate the causal relationship between fear of financial loss and online customers' purchase intentions, this will be done by looking at the mediating effects (if any) of online security vis-\u00e0-vis privacy concerns H1: Fear of financial loss will predict online customers' purchase intentions via the mediating effect of online security and privacy concern.

To accomplish this, we examined two direct relations, namely, H2 and H4 whiles the remaining hypothesized scenarios were centered on the observation of mediated relationship (i.e. H1 and H3).

While this study is able to predict customers' in an emerging economies fear of online identity theft towards their zeal to embark on online transactions, specifically using three major constructs i.e. FOFL, FORD, and OSPCON. In sum, this study provides a strong reference point to continue to broaden the literature in the developing economy so far as online transactions are concerned, arguing that the internet is not leaving in extinction any time soon.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding Observations"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "The theory of planned behavior", "authors": [{"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Ajzen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1991, "venue": "Organ.
