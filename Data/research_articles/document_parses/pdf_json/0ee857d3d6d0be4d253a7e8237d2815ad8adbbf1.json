The mechanism of ACP in ARDS is established as refractory hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, and microvascular thrombosis acutely increase RV afterload (2) . Among COVID-19 patients, elevations in troponin and brain natriuretic peptide levels have been shown to be both correlative with elevations in D-dimer and predictive of mortality (3). These laboratory abnormalities may not be a coincidence as emerging autopsies on COVID-19 patients have identified small vessel pulmonary thrombosis and RV dilation (4).",

Utilization of prone ventilation is one means in which this is accomplished while minimizing PEEP. A pulmonary arterial catheter may limit comorbid cardiogenic edema while also aiding in optimization of RV preload, cardiac output, and pulmonary vascular resistance for which inotropic support and inhaled pulmonary vasodilators should be considered. In the absence of a pulmonary arterial catheter, central venous pressure monitoring and evaluation of central venous oxygen saturation is encouraged for optimizing RV preload, kidney perfusion pressure gradients, and cardiac output. Management of microvascular thrombi remains unclear however close monitoring of D-dimer and cardiac biomarkers may have implications on empiric anticoagulation however this warrants further investigation.",
