The most important issues are the total duration and the peak time of the infection evolution as well as the maximum number of daily infections. It would be most helpful for many people to have a reproducable, crude, but reliable estimate when this pandemic wave is over. It is the purpose of this manuscript to provide such an estimate based on a simplified Gaussian model for the time development of the pandemic outburst.",

The central limit theorem states that in situations, when many n 1 independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal or Gaussian distribution function of the form (1) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. The spread of the virus infection of populations with high number of persons certainly is such a random process to which the central limit theorem ia applicable. Each person in a given population has a probability distribution (normalized to unity) as a function of time of being infected: it is a very noncontinuous distribution being 1 at the day of infection and 0 on all other days. If one adds up these discrete distributions of persons living in villages and districts of towns of typical size of about 1000 persons one obtains quasi-continous probability distributions for be- * rsch@tp4.rub.de, schlickeiser@gmail.com ing infected which certainly will be different in hotspots of the disease and isolated rural areas. If we then add up a large number of these village probability distributions for all of Germany we obtain the daily infection rate distribution which according to the central limit is close to a Gaussian distribution.",

We will only know for sure after the first pandemic wave is over. So it is possible that our estimates and we are wrong. We take this risk because we are convinced that many persons will welcome our optimistic estimate that the first wave is over by end of May 2020. There is light at the end of a long tunnel. Our estimate might also help decision makers when to lift the current societal and economical lockdown. Die erste Welle wird gegen Ende Mai 2020 in Deutschland enden mit einem tausendstel kleineren Neuinfektionsraten. Diese Vorhersagen basieren auf der Annahme einer Gauss-f\u00f6rmigen Zeitverteilung der Infizierungsrate, die gut durch den zentralen Grenzwertsatz der Statistik begr\u00fcndet ist. Die Breite und die Zeit des Maximums der Gauss-Verteilung und damit deren Gesamtdauer werden durch einen statistischen \u03c7 2 -Fit an die in Deutschland beobachteten Verdopplungszeiten vor dem 28.M\u00e4rz 2020 bestimmt. Die Behandlung aller schwer erkrankten Patienten mit Beatmungsger\u00e4ten ist gew\u00e4hrleistet, wenn es durch die andauernden Quarant\u00e4ne-und soziale Distanzierungs-Massnahmen gelingt, die Anzahl der infizierten Personen in der Bev\u00f6lkerung durch die erste Welle unter 30 Prozent zu halten.",
