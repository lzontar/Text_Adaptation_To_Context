Common testing algorithms for determining the etiology of CAP also suffer from poor sensitivity and specificity, particularly for bacterial infections, since blood culture is predominantly used to determine the bacterial etiology of pneumonia in children [9] . The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis aids in identifying viral causes of pneumonia, but pathogens detected in the upper respiratory tract may not correlate with pathogens obtained directly from the lung.

Of these, 576 (26%) had a coinfection (Supplementary Table 1 ), including 417 children with \u2265 2 viruses detected, 99 with \u2265 1 virus and \u2265 1 typical bacterial pathogen, 56 with \u2265 1 virus and \u2265 1 atypical bacterial pathogen, and four with two bacterial pathogens. Children with only viruses detected were younger than children with only typical bacteria detected, and children with only atypical bacteria detected were older than either of these groups (Table  1) . Children with only viruses detected were more likely to be black than children with only typical bacterial or atypical bacterial pathogens. The age distribution and race of children with virus-bacterium coinfection most closely resembled those with viral infection alone (Table 1) . Children with typical bacterial infection alone, atypical bacterial infection alone, or virus-typical bacterium coinfection were more likely to have no previous underlying medical conditions and less likely to have asthma than children with viral infection alone. No striking differences in body mass index or vaccination history were observed among types of infection. Children with a diagnosis of atypical bacterial infection alone were more likely to have received antibiotics prior to admission than the other groups ( Table 1) . The most common pathogens among codetection pairings are shown in Figure 2 . The viruses most commonly identified in CAP, RSV and hRV, were also the viruses most frequently found in combination with other viruses and/or bacteria. Among commonly identified pathogens, influenza virus was not detected with Haemophilus influenzae, and M. pneumoniae was not detected with S. pyogenes or H. influenzae. S. pneumoniae was detected in association with the major viruses detected here in roughly equal proportions ( Figure 2 ). For many other pathogen pairings, however, the distribution of pathogen pairings was different than expected by chance (Figures 2 and 3 ). For example, hAdV and hRV were detected together more commonly as a pair than expected, based on their relative frequency of detection in the (7) Influenza antiviral 8 (<1) 3 (7) a 1 (1) c 6 (6) d 2 (4) 7 (2) Data are no.

EPIC study; a similar pattern was observed for hCoV and RSV. Although the fifth most common pathogen detected overall, M. pneumoniae was the ninth most common pathogen codetected with other organisms; the relative infrequency of coinfections with M. pneumoniae was noted, particularly when pairings with respiratory viruses were examined ( Figure 3) . Several virus pairs were also observed less frequently than expected, including hMPV with hRV, PIV, or RSV; PIV with hRV or RSV; and hRV with RSV. Clinical symptoms associated with CAP were generally similar among different infection groupings, and length of illness prior to admission did not differ statistically ( Table 2 ). The total white blood cell count and the percentage of white blood cells that were band forms were significantly higher in the typical bacteria and viruses-typical bacteria groups compared to the viruses group. Chest radiography findings, including consolidation and pleural effusion, were also more common in these 2 groups as compared to the viruses group, whereas infiltrates and a pattern consistent with complicated bronchiolitis were less common (Table 2) . Serious outcomes or complications, including parapneumonic effusion, admission to an intensive care unit, and use of mechanical ventilation, were significantly more common in the typical bacteria and viruses-typical bacteria groups as compared to the viruses group; median length of stay was also about twice as long in the typical bacteria and viruses-typical bacteria groups (Table 2 ). Outcome measures, including intensive care admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and length of stay, were similar for the typical bacteria group as compared to the viruses-typical bacteria group. Extending these analyses beyond the broad groupings in Tables 1 and 2, the differences in outcomes remained significant in comparisons of single viruses or multiple viruses to coinfections between viruses and single typical bacterial pathogens or multiple typical bacterial pathogens (Table 3) . Intensive care unit admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and length of stay were all significantly greater when single or multiple viruses were complicated by \u22651 typical bacterial pathogen as compared to infections due to single or multiple viruses alone. Coinfections by viruses and atypical bacteria did not lead to worse outcomes. Two virus-virus coinfections (RSV and hAdV vs hAdV alone; influenza virus and RSV vs influenza virus alone) demonstrated higher rates of supplemental oxygen use in the first 24 hours of hospitalization, compared with single infections alone. Other virus-virus coinfections did not lead to similar findings, and no differences in intensive care unit admission or need for mechanical ventilation were identified (Table 3) . Interestingly, children with influenza virus and RSV coinfection had a shorter length of stay than those infected with either influenza virus or RSV alone. Typical bacterial coinfection with RSV was associated with statistically significant increases in the length of hospital admission and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation as compared to infection with RSV alone (Table  3) . Intensive care unit admission was also twice as frequent among children with RSV-typical bacterium coinfections, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 80, "end": 88, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 145, "end": 152, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 543, "end": 553, "text": "(Table  1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 827, "end": 836, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1370, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1447, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1882, "end": 1890, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2029, "text": "(Figures 2 and 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2532, "end": 2540, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3537, "end": 3546, "text": "Figure 3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3866, "end": 3873, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 4329, "end": 4338, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 4718, "end": 4726, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 5216, "end": 5225, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 5986, "end": 5995, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 6374, "end": 6384, "text": "(Table  3)", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "Because of the difficulties attributing a specific etiology to a pathogen or to multiple pathogens, the current state of knowledge of the role of coinfections in CAP is limited in several critical areas.

The finding that asthma and reactive airway disease were more frequent as comorbidities in the viruses group as compared to the typical bacteria group is therefore not surprising (Table 1) . Interestingly, the viruses-typical bacteria group had a low prevalence rate of asthma, which, when coupled with worse outcomes, could lead to the speculation that asthmatics with viral pneumonia were more likely to be admitted for reasons related to their underlying chronic diagnosis, rather than for the severity of their CAP. Alternatively, the immune status of the allergic lung could provide protection from the consequences of these infections. As has been suggested from work in animal models, this could mitigate disease severity [14] . Obesity was identified as a risk factor for severe influenza during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic [15] .

A wealth of literature from animal models and epidemiologic studies [6] suggests that viral infections enhance acquisition of bacterial pathogens by hampering immune defenses through a variety of mechanisms. Similarly, studies of the common cold in crowded living conditions suggest similar changes to susceptibility in humans to acquisition of colonization with pathogenic bacteria [21, 22] . However, prior studies have not been large enough to adequately compare the actual frequency of specific pathogen-pathogen pairs in a coinfection to the frequency expected by chance. We report that the observed prevalence of several specific codetections was lower than expected, particularly when examining virus pairings with M. pneumoniae (Figure 3) . A smaller study of M. pneumoniae infections noted that codetection with viruses was rare [23] . One hypothesis to explain the relative paucity of M. pneumoniae and virus codetections is that infections with these pathogens exhibit different age and seasonal distributions. Indeed, the mean age of children presenting with M. pneumoniae in the study was 98 months, while the mean age for children hospitalized with respiratory viruses ranged from 25 months (for hAdV and RSV) to 63 months (for influenza virus) (Supplementary Figure 1) . Stratification of the analyses by age (<5 years and \u22655 years) demonstrated a similar magnitude of effect as compared to the overall study population, although the CIs were wider and crossed 0 in some cases, suggesting decreased power to examine the interactions ( Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 ). In addition, M. pneumoniae was not detected with H. influenzae or S. pyogenes, common bacterial pathogens of the upper respiratory tract. This may be due to the low numbers of bacterial infections in the study, or it may be related to competition within the upper respiratory tract between bacteria, as has been observed in bacterial coinfection models [24] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 187, "end": 190, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 502, "end": 506, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 507, "end": 510, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 957, "end": 961, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2059, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 855, "end": 865, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1402, "text": "Figure 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1698, "text": "Supplementary Figures 2 and 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Several virus-virus pairings were also uncommonly observed. Interestingly, an additional virus-virus interaction, hAdV and RSV, was also significantly less common than expected when analyzing only children aged <5 years (Supplementary Figure 2) . The simplest explanation would be differences in seasonality that limited temporal circulation together and thus minimized the chance of a codetection (Supplementary Figure 4) . Because we were studying children hospitalized with pneumonia and not a broader population, further analyses regarding the impact of seasonality were not possible. Another hypothesis is that induction of interferon by a first virus protects against the second virus. At least 2 studies have suggested that circulation of rhinoviruses delays or reduces the circulation of other viruses, as was seen in this study with hRV pairings with RSV, PIV, and hMPV [25, 26] . This and other hypotheses should be studied in model systems. Unfortunately, the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was too low for a similar analysis to be performed for specific virus and bacterium pairings. From existing observational studies and animal models (eg, mouse and ferret models of influenza virus and S. pneumoniae coinfection [27, 28] ) one would have expected an increased frequency of specific pathogen pairings relative to chance. Why this was seen for hAdV and RSV and for hCoV and RSV but not other pairings is unclear; further study is indicated to replicate and potentially explain these findings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 879, "end": 883, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 884, "end": 887, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1245, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1249, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 220, "end": 244, "text": "(Supplementary Figure 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 398, "end": 422, "text": "(Supplementary Figure 4)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "This study has several limitations and challenges. Detection of bacteria in patients with CAP is difficult and may have caused misclassification of some virus-bacterium coinfections into the viruses-only group. The assays to determine etiology and define classes of infections did not include all possible viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens, which may also have caused misclassification, and only 44% of children had acute and convalescent serum specimens available for serologic testing. Some results may be confounded by factors such as age, comorbidities, or strong seasonal circulation of certain viruses; the analyses were unadjusted for these potential confounders. We also could not adjust for the likelihood of hospitalization with each pathogen, which will bias the determination of the frequency of codetection in the hospital downward if patients infected with the pathogen in the community are more likely to be admitted than patients not infected with the pathogen. Finally, the contribution of any specific pathogen to the severity of infection cannot be determined with certainty; on average, 3% of asymptomatic controls (and up to 17% with hRV) in the EPIC study had a virus detected [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1207, "end": 1210, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, this study was very large and comprehensive in its assessment of the etiology of coinfections and the demographic characteristics and outcomes of these children hospitalized for CAP.

The findings of differences in clinical characteristics and severity of outcomes with virus-typical bacterium coinfections as compared to viruses alone and the few observed differences in comparisons of single-virus infections to multiple-virus infections or of single-typical bacterium infections to virus-typical bacterium infections have important implications for the diagnosis and management of CAP in children.
