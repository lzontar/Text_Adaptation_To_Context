Figure 2 (a) shows the inhibition percentage of ATP hydrolysis by DTPMPA. To determine the IC 50 value of DTPMPA, ATP hydrolysis assays were repeated in the presence of various concentrations of DTPMPA. As a result of the analysis, we were able to obtain the IC 50 value of 1.19 AE 0.16 \u03bcM. In addition to ATP hydrolysis, fluorometric assays were also performed to determine whether DTPMPA inhibits dsDNA unwinding. In case two DNA strands were base-paired, no fluorescence signal was monitored due to quenching by black hole quencher (BHQ). However, strong fluorescence signal was detectable when dsDNA was unwound by helicase. Based on this experimental setup, we measured inhibition of dsDNA unwinding by helicase in the presence of various concentrations of DTPMPA, as shown in Figure 2 (b). IC 50 value of DTPMPA was obtained from this analysis and determined to be 32.9 AE 1.0 \u03bcM. Furthermore, we have exposed normal WI-38 cells (fetal lung tissue of human) to various concentrations of DTPMPA and performed 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to determine whether DTPMPA has potential cytotoxicity. As shown in Figure 3 , DTPMPA possesses no cytotoxicity to WI-38 cells in the presence of concentrations used. This suggests that DTPMPA is a safe chemical compound at pharmacologically effective concentration.",

DTPMPA was found to have inhibitory effects on ATP \u00a7 These two authors contributed equally to this work. Note hydrolysis as well as dsDNA unwinding. Moreover, DTPMPA did not show any cytotoxic effect when we treated it to normal cells. Thus far, the reported synthesized and naturally occurring compounds targeting SARS-CoV helicase are known to suppress selectively either ATP hydrolysis or dsDNA unwinding. [14] [15] [16] Previous studies have demonstrated that the synthesized dihydroxychromone derivatives, which is a bioisostere of aryl diketoacid, inhibit only dsDNA unwinding. 15 However, myricetin and scutellarein, which are naturally occurring flavonoids similar to dihydroxychromone derivatives, inhibit only ATP hydrolysis. 16 The reason for this discrepancy is not known at present, but this may be due to substituents attached to diketoacid core. In fact, depending on the kind of group attached, various degrees of ATP hydrolysis or dsDNA unwinding inhibition were observed in case of dihydroxychromone derivatives. 15 Although precise mechanism of how DTPMPA inhibits both ATP hydrolysis and dsDNA unwinding is unclear at present due to insufficient structural information, DTPMPA is thought to hold a great potential for use in treating SARS, specifically targeting helicase, after elaborate investigation in future.",

Percentage inhibition of SARS-CoV helicase by N-(4-((4,6-dioxo-2-thioxotetrahydropyrimidin-5(2H)-ylidene)methyl) phenyl)acetamide: (a) ATP hydrolysis activity and (b) dsDNA unwinding activity. Measurement of cell viability in the presence of N-(4-((4,6-dioxo-2-thioxotetrahydropyrimidin-5(2H)-ylidene)methyl) phenyl)acetamide. 37 C and the reaction was stopped by adding 200 \u03bcL of AM/MG reagent (0.034% MG, 1.05% AM, and 0.04% Tween 20 in 1 M HCl). The developed color was monitored by measuring at 620 nm and the released P i was calculated using a standard curve. All experiments were repeated thrice and averaged. DNA Unwinding Assay. BHQ-labeled 45-base-DNA oligomer and Fluorescein-labeled 25-base-DNA oligomer were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA). The base sequences of BHQ-labeled and Fluorescein-labeled DNAs were as follows: 5 0 -20T25 BHQ (5 0 -T 20 GAGCGGATTACTATACTACATTAGA(BHQ)-3 0 ) and 3 0 -0T25Flu (5 0 -(Fluorescein)TCTAATGTAGTATAG TAATCCGCTC-3 0 ). The dsDNA substrate of helicase was prepared by annealing 5 0 -20T25BHQ and 3 0 -0T25Flu. The 5 0 -20 T25 BHQ was synthesized to have a 20-base dT tail at the 5 0 -terminus to load the SARS-CoV helicase. After 1 \u03bcL of various concentrations of DTPMPA was placed on each well of the 96-well plate, a 80 \u03bcL solution of 150 nM helicase in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) was added to each well. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, dsDNA unwinding reaction was started by addition of 20 \u03bcL 5\u00d7 reaction solution (5 mM MgCl 2 , 45 mM ATP, 25 mM DTT, and 100 nM dsDNA substrate in 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4]). The mixture was further reacted for 2 min at 37 C and the reaction was stopped by addition of 100 \u03bcL termination solution (0.1 M EDTA and 0.4 \u03bcM trap DNA [unmodified 25-base 3 0 -0 T25 DNA oligomer] in 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4]). The sample was excited at 485 nm and the fluorescence was measured at 535 nm.",
