A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiological imaging using chest radiography. It was found in early studies that patients present abnormalities in chest radiography images that are characteristic of those infected with COVID-19. Motivated by this, a number of artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on deep learning have been proposed and results have been shown to be quite promising in terms of accuracy in detecting patients infected with COVID-19 using chest radiography images. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, these developed AI systems have been closed source and unavailable to the research community for deeper understanding and extension, and unavailable for public access and use. Therefore, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. We also describe the CXR dataset leveraged to train COVID-Net, which we will refer to as COVIDx and is comprised of 13,800 chest radiography images across 13,725 patient patient cases from three open access data repositories, one of which we introduced.

We also described COVIDx, a CXR dataset leveraged to train COVID-Net that is comprised of 13,800 CXR images across 13,725 patient cases from two open access data repositories. Moreover, we investigated how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening as well as improve trust and transparency when leveraging COVID-Net for accelerated computer-aided screening.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the promising results achieved by COVID-Net on the COVIDx test dataset, along with the fact that it is available in open source format alongside the description on constructing the open source dataset, will lead it to be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases from CXR images and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most. Future directions include continuing to improve sensitivity and PPV to COVID-19 infections as new data is collected, as well as extend the proposed COVID-Net to risk stratification for survival analysis, predicting risk status of patients, and predicting hospitalization duration which would be useful for triaging, patient population management, and individualized care planning.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "COVID-19 image data collection", "authors": [{"first": "Joseph", "middle": [], "last": "Paul Cohen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Paul", "middle": [], "last": "Morrison", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Lan", "middle": [], "last": "Dao", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Example CXR images of COVID-19 cases from several different patients and their associated critical factors", "authors": [], "year": null, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition", "authors": [], "year": 2009, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "248--255", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Correlation of chest CT and RT-PCR testing in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in china: A report of 1014 cases", "authors": [{"first": "Ai", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "Radiology", "volume": "", "issn": "1", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Figure 1 COVID-19 chest x-ray data initiative", "authors": [{"first": "Chung", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "", "volume": "2", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Sensitivity of chest CT for covid-19: Comparison to RT-PCR", "authors": [{"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Fang", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "Radiology", "volume": "", "issn": "2", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Rapid AI development cycle for the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic: Initial results for automated detection and patient monitoring using deep learning ct image analysis", "authors": [{"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Goze", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {"arXiv": ["arXiv:2003.05037"]}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in wuhan, china.
