The genome of FgGMTV1 comprises three circular ssDNA segments (DNA-A, DNA-B, and DNA-C). Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses showed that FgGMTV1 is nested within the family Genomoviridae. We also constructed the first infectious DNA clones of a DNA mycovirus. Our results show that DNA-A and DNA-B are mutually interdependent for their replication and are associated with severely reduced colony growth and hypovirulence. DNA-C relies on DNA-A and DNA-B for replication and is necessary for the recovery of abnormal fungal phenotypes. DNA-C also enhances the accumulation of viral DNA in infected fungi and permits stable colonization and easy transmission via conidia. This is the first multipartite DNA virus isolated from a fungus. Our phylogenetic analyses also suggest that the multipartite genome of FgGMTV1 may have evolved from a monopartite genome of an ancient genomovirus. A tripartite ssDNA mycovirus from a plant pathogenic fungus is infectious as cloned DNA and purified virions. Sci. Adv. 6, eaay9634 (2020).",

According to the latest list of fungal viruses approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), mycoviruses have double-stranded (ds) RNA linear genomes, positivesense single-stranded (+ss) RNA linear genomes including reversetranscribing RNA linear genomes, negative-sense ssRNA (\u2212ssRNA) linear genomes, or ssDNA circular genomes (3) . The discovery of fungal viruses occurred relatively late compared to the identification and characterization of viruses of animals, plants, and prokaryotes, perhaps due primarily to the cryptic or asymptomatic nature of mycoviruses (4) . However, the number of known mycoviruses has rapidly increased in the past few decades, and this trend is expected to continue, especially with the development and widespread use of nextgeneration sequencing techniques in the field of virology (3, 5) . Studies based on this approach, along with conventional fungal virus hunting, have greatly promoted our understanding of mycovirus diversity and evolution (1) .",

CRESS DNA viruses have been identified in environmental, fungal, plant, and animal samples. Because of their high diversity, variable genome organizations, and unknown hosts, a large number of the recently identified CRESS DNA viruses cannot be classified into any known viral families, which has resulted in large, novel CRESS DNA viral groups being proposed (8) . One of the recently proposed groups is the family Genomoviridae (sigil: Ge-for geminivirus-like and nomo-for no movement protein) (9) . Currently, there are nine approved genera in this family: Gemycircularvirus, Gemyduguivirus, Gemygorvirus, Gemykibivirus, Gemykolovirus, Gemykrogvirus, Gemykroznavirus, Gemytondvirus, and Gemyvongvirus (10) . These viruses have small (~2 to 2.4 kb), circular ssDNA genomes, and they encode rolling-circle replication initiation proteins (Rep) that are mostly similar to those of geminiviruses, as well as unique capsid proteins (9, 10) . Of all the identified genomoviruses, only Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypovirulence-associated DNA virus 1 (SsHADV-1) (species, Sclerotinia gemycircularvirus 1; genus, Gemycircularvirus) has been associated with known hosts, S. sclerotiorum (11) and a mycophagous fly, Lycoriella ingenua (12) .",

Compared to the capsid protein, Rep is better conserved across these viruses and satellites (14) . Conserved motifs within the Rep are important for these viruses and satellites to replicate through RCR (14) . These conserved motifs are divided into two main categories based on their roles: the RCR motifs I, II, and III in the N termini of Reps and the superfamily 3 helicase motifs in the C termini, known as Walker-A, Walker-B, and motif C (14) . In addition, a conserved motif [geminivirus Rep sequence (GRS)] located between motifs II and III was initially only found in geminiviruses and later also identified in genomoviruses (10, 15) . These CRESS DNA viruses replicate through the RCR mechanism, which is similar to that used by bacterial plasmids (14, 16, 17) . The three conserved RCR motifs are well conserved across CRESS DNA viruses and plasmids (14, 18, 19) .",

Unexpectedly, SsHADV-1-related sequences were identified in strain HB58 collected in the Hebei province of China. The strain HB58 was identified as F. graminearum based on sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments and subsequent BLASTn searches of translation elongation factor 1\uf061 (EF-1\uf061) ( Fig. 1A and fig. S1 ) (22) . Electron microscopy observation revealed that the negatively stained virus particles purified from strain HB58 were isometric with a diameter of ~19 to 21 nm (Fig. 1B) , comparable to the 20 to 22 nm in diameter reported for SsHADV-1 (11) . Nucleic acids extracted from the viral particles appeared as a band at ~1.3 kb in agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C) . To confirm the properties of the extracted nucleic acids, different nucleases were used. The viral nucleic acids could be digested with both deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) (active against ssDNA and dsDNA) and S1 nuclease (active against ssDNA or ssRNA), but not with exonuclease III (active against linear dsDNA) or exonuclease I (active against linear ssDNA) (Fig. 1D ).

Restriction digestion of the RCA products generated a unit-length DNA of ~1.3 kb using five tested restriction enzymes (Bam HI, Eco RI, Sal I, Bgl II, and Kpn I). In addition, using Sal I, a 0.9-kb DNA, and using Kpn I, a 1-kb DNA, were observed upon electrophoresis. The restricted and cloned RCA products were sequenced and analyzed. The full-length sequences were obtained by PCR using specific back-toback primers designed based on the sequences obtained above. Last, a total of three circular ssDNA components (DNA-A, DNA-B, and DNA-C) associated with the nucleic acids from viral particles were identified, sequenced, and confirmed by Southern blot analyses (Fig. 1, F (9) ; however, the Rep gene of DNA-A lacks an intron similarly to that of SsHADV-1 (11) . DNA-B was 1320 nt in length and contained a large ORF with a coding potential for a protein of 215 amino acids (Fig. 1G ). The deduced protein shared the highest similarity with the capsid protein (CP) of Finch-associated genomovirus 7 (GenBank accession number QCQ85257.1; 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u221210 , 77% coverage and 21.74% identity), an unpublished virus in the family Genomoviridae. Three bands could be observed in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of purified virus particles (Fig. 1E) ; unexpectedly, the relative molecular mass estimated by SDS-PAGE for the top band was similar to the deduced size (34.2 kDa) of the DNA-B encoding capsid protein, while the size of another two bands was smaller than the expected 34.2 kDa. The three bands were unambiguously identified by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) as the CP. This triple-band SDS-PAGE profile might be attributed to partial degradation of CP or to posttranslational modifications of the protein; further studies will be necessary to clarify this point. DNA-C (1309 nt) contained a large ORF potentially encoding a protein with a molecular mass of 25.8 kDa (Fig. 1G) , hereafter named p26, which had no obvious similarities to other sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database.",

A fourth conserved motif, GRS, was also found in this Rep (table S1). Sequence analyses of the full-length amino acid sequence of the putative Rep and CP of this ssDNA virus and selected genomoviruses showed that this novel virus shared higher Rep amino acid sequence identity (24.1 to 33.0%) than CP sequence identity (10.3 to 17.1%) with selected genomoviruses (table S2). Phylogenetic analysis of the Reps of this virus and selected ssDNA viruses indicated that this ssDNA virus was nested within the family Genomoviridae (Fig. 2) . In many instances, the putative Rep encoded by divergent CRESS DNA viruses is the only protein that has any detectable sequence similarity to other known ssDNA viral Reps (10, 14) . Compared to the Rep amino acid sequences, the CP sequences of this ssDNA virus and the members of nine genera in the family Genomoviridae were all found to be phylogenetically more divergent ( fig. S3 ), possibly because they are involved in interactions with cell surface receptors in the hosts and/ or vectors (10) . In conclusion, we can verify that these three DNA segments are circular ssDNA molecules and tentatively assign this ssDNA virus the name \"Fusarium graminearum gemytripvirus 1 (FgGMTV1).\" We suggest that the mycovirus FgGMTV1 is a representative member of the new proposed genus Gemytripvirus (Geminilike myco-infecting tripartite virus) in the family Genomoviridae. The GenBank accession numbers for the nucleotide sequence of DNA-A, DNA-B, and DNA-C of FgGMTV1 are MK430076, MK430077, and MK430078, respectively.",

S4 ) (23, 24) . Eight transfectants were generated with different combinations of clones pSK-2A, pSK-2B, and pSK-1.6C and one transfectant using purified viral particles (table S3) , among which strain S was used as a negative control. Southern blot analyses of viral DNA extracted from PH-1 and nine transfectants were conducted using probe A, probe B, and probe C (Fig. 3) . When using probe A and probe B, viral DNA replicative forms were only present in strain A + B, strain A + B + C, and strain Virion, demonstrating a successful infection, but not in the other seven strains (Fig. 3) . When using probe C, viral DNA replicative forms were only present in strain A + B + C and strain Virion, but not in the strain A + B or in the other seven strains (Fig. 3) . Southern hybridization analyses showed that DNA-A, DNA-B, or DNA-C alone were not infectious; the combination of DNA-A and DNA-C or the combination of DNA-B and DNA-C were also shown not to be infectious, but the combination of DNA-A and DNA-B, the combination of DNA-A, DNA-B, and DNA-C, and viral particles were infectious. These results suggest that DNA-A and DNA-B are mutually interdependent and sufficient for their replication, while DNA-C relies on DNA-A and DNA-B. In addition, strain A + B + C and strain Virion accumulated more viral DNA than strain A + B, indicating that DNA-C enhances the accumulation level of viral DNA in infected fungi.",

Compared to the virus-free strains PH-1 and S, strain A + B showed abnormal colony morphology (Fig. 4A ). Strain A + B grew on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at a rate of 9.3 mm/day, whose growth was much slower than that of strain PH-1 (19.0 mm/day) and strain S (18.5 mm/day) (Fig. 4C ). In addition, strain A + B had a significant reduction in colony diameter [45. 5% reduction compared to strain PH-1 (P < 0.01) and 44.5% reduction compared to strain S (P < 0.01)] (Fig. 4B ) and conidial production [55.1% reduction compared to strain PH-1 (P < 0.01) and 52.3% reduction compared to strain S (P < 0.01)] (Fig. 4D) . Strains A + B + C, Virion, and HB58 showed similar characteristics to the virus-free strains PH-1 and S (Fig. 4) . In the virulence assay, 10 \uf06dl of the conidial suspension was inoculated in the glume of a spikelet and cultured in the field for 15 days. Before the virulence assay, we tested the probability of the viral horizontal and vertical transmission. Southern blot analyses showed that the virus from strains A + B or A + B + C could be efficiently transmitted to the strain PH-1 incorporating a hygromycin-resistance gene (hph) (PH-1 hph ), but not from virus-carrying strain HB58 to the vegetative incompatible strain PH-1 hph via hyphal anastomosis ( fig. S6A ). In addition, the virus in strain A + B + C was vertically transmitted through conidia at a 5 to 10% rate (figs. S6B and S7A), while no virus was detected from single ascospore isolates (0 infected of 150 tested) ( fig. S6C ). As for strain A + B, both the transmission rates through conidia (75 tested) and ascospores (150 tested) were 0% (figs. S6, B and C, and S7A). When inoculating a conidial suspension into the glume of a spikelet, there was no significant difference in virulence among these six strains ( fig. S7B) . However, when a small equisized mycelial plug was put into the glume of a spikelet, strain A + B spread more slowly from the inoculation sites to nearby spikelets than the other five strains (Fig. 4E ). At 15 days after inoculation, there was a significant reduction [81.3% reduction compared to strain PH-1 (P < 0.01) and 79.1% reduction compared to strain S (P < 0.01)] in the number of diseased spikelets per invaded wheat head infected with strain A + B (Fig. 4E ). The fungi were isolated from the glume of spikelets, and PCR was carried out using DNA-A-, DNA-B-, or DNA-C-specific degenerate primer pairs (table S4) . It was worth mentioning that PCR products of the expected sizes were detected using primer pairs specific for DNA-A or DNA-B in the glumes of spikelets inoculated with mycelial plugs of strain A + B, but not the glumes of spikelets inoculated with a conidial suspension of strain A + B ( fig. S8 ). Together, these results indicate that DNA-A and/or DNA-B might be related to hypovirulence of the fungal host, which could be countered by DNA-C; in addition, viral transmission through conidia requires DNA-C.",

            "text": "Viruses of the family Genomoviridae are circular ssDNA viruses (~2 to 2.4 kb), encoding a Rep and a capsid protein in the same circular DNA molecule. Here, we report a novel ssDNA virus in the family Genomoviridae, and its genome comprises three circular ssDNA components of ~1.3 kb in size referred to as DNA-A (encoding the replication protein), DNA-B (encoding the capsid protein), and Bacilladnaviridae, Circoviridae, Geminiviridae, Genomoviridae, Nanoviridae, and Smacoviridae are the only six eukaryotic CRESS DNA viral families currently recognized by the ICTV (7, 13, 25) . Among those, members of the Circoviridae, Geminiviridae, Genomoviridae, and Smacoviridae families are circular ssDNA viruses (2 to 3 kb in size) that encode a Rep and a CP in the same circular DNA molecule (9, 13, 25) . Viruses of the family Bacilladnaviridae have larger genome sizes than other eukaryotic CRESS DNA viruses (~4.5 to 6 kb) (7) . Viruses of the genus Begomovirus in the family Geminiviridae have either one or two components (13) . Members of two genera, Nanovirus and Babuvirus, in the family Nanoviridae encompass viruses with multicomponent genomes, where each component (~1 kb in size) encodes a single protein and is packaged into a separate particle (6, 13) . Five homologous DNA components of these two genera (referred to as DNA-R, DNA-S, DNA-C, DNA-M, and DNA-N) encode a replication initiator protein (Rep), a capsid protein (CP), a cell cycle link protein, a movement protein, and a nuclear shuttle protein. Another DNA (DNA-U3) from babuviruses and three other DNAs (DNA-U1, DNA-U2, and DNA-U3) from nanoviruses encode potential proteins with presently unknown functions. All DNA components share two regions of sequence similarity known as the CR-SL and the CR-M (for babuviruses) or CR-II (for nanoviruses) (13) . The DNA-R component encoding the master Rep is capable of self-replication and is required for replication of all other genome components (26, 27) . Similarly, FgGMTV1 DNA-A, DNA-B, and DNA-C also have two common regions named CR-M and CR-SL, and DNA-A is required for replicating the two other genome components. However, in contrast to DNA-R, DNA-A alone could not be detected using Southern blotting analysis, suggesting that this molecule is not sufficient to sustain self-replication. A putative circovirus-related multicomponent virus, known as the Pacific flying fox feces-associated multicomponent virus 1 (PfffaMCV-1) that was sequenced from Pacific flying fox feces, harbored three ssDNA molecules of 1143 to 1163 nt that encoded a single ORF (6) . In this viral genome, one ORF encoded a Rep, the second encoded a putative CP, and the third one showed no similarities with any sequences in GenBank. The PfffaMCV-1 Rep shared the highest sequence identity (48%) with the Rep of a circovirus and contained the conserved residues seen in the Rep motifs of eukaryotic CRESS DNA viruses. However, the hosts of this virus are not known. Another two putative multicomponent viruses, referred to as blackfly multicomponent virus (BfMCV) 1 and 2 that were recovered in the New Zealand blackflies, have Reps most similar to the multicomponent virus PfffaMCV-1, sharing 65 and 67% amino acid similarity, respectively (28) . All these factors showed that, in addition to multicomponent viruses in the family Nanoviridae, other multipartite ssDNA viruses that encode a Rep and a CP in separate circular DNA molecule, like FgGMTV1, exist. To date, multiparticulate fungal viruses or mycoviruses have been classified into four families and one genus with linear dsRNA virus genomes (Chrysoviridae, Megabirnaviridae, Partitiviridae, Quadriviridae, and Botybirnavirus) (29) . In addition, no mycoviruses with multipartite DNA genomes have previously been reported. FgGMTV1 is the first multipartite DNA virus infecting fungi.",

            "text": "Because of the RCR mechanism common to geminiviruses infecting plants and to plasmids replicating in bacteria, archaea, and algae, a scenario that geminiviruses, appearing relatively late in viral evolution, have originated from plasmids via the acquisition of capsid protein genes from ssRNA viruses has been proposed (19, (30) (31) (32) (33) . In this context, the existence of a pre-mastrevirus between plasmids and geminiviruses has been hypothesized (32) . The family Genomoviridae is a geminivirus-like family, in which viruses encode a Rep with similarities to that of the geminiviruses (9). As Yu et al. (11) described, SsHADV-1 (from the family Genomoviridae) is likely to resemble a possible precursor of pre-mastreviruses. In this study, the phylogenetic analysis of the Reps and CPs of FgGMTV1 and selected ssDNA viruses indicated that FgGMTV1 was lodged within the family Genomoviridae ( Fig. 2 and fig. S3 ). fig. S5 , A to D), which is different from an original genomovirus encoding a Rep and a CP in the same circular DNA molecule (9) . Some in vitro studies have confirmed that two complementary defective molecules from a complete nonsegmental virus can evolve into two components of a bipartite virus (37) (38) (39) . Therefore, the multipartite genome of FgGMTV1 may represent a natural case of relatively recent multipartition. Besides, defective genomic DNA, 236 to 284 nt in length, has been detected in SsHADV-1, which is the first member of the family Genomoviridae (9) . However, the origin of the third segment DNA-C of FgGMTV1 and its function on the evolution of FgGMTV1 need to be further investigated. The development of transformation and transfection techniques [e.g., transformation of fungal spheroplasts using complementary DNA (cDNA) infectious clones (40, 41) , and transfection of fungal spheroplasts with dsRNA (42), in vitro-transcribed RNA transcripts (43) (44) (45) , or purified virions (46, 47) ] has facilitated the identification of viral and/or host factor(s) involved in symptom induction or virus replication for many mycovirus-host systems, especially in the hypovirus-host system (2) . These techniques can also be used to expand the host ranges of some mycoviruses, without the obstacles of vegetative incompatibility (48) . Among CRESS DNA viruses, the infectious DNA clones are mainly available for circoviruses and geminiviruses and are used to explore the properties of these ssDNA viruses and use ssDNA viruses as multifunctional vectors (23, 24, 49, 50) . Previous to this work, only infectious cDNA clones of RNA mycoviruses have been constructed. In this study, the first infectious DNA clones of a DNA mycovirus were obtained. These clones will allow future further exploration of the interaction between FgGMTV1 and F. graminearum and could be also applicable to effectively extend the infection of FgGMTV1 to other hosts and enable manipulation of FgGMTV1 for both fundamental and practical applications.",

FgGMTV1 DNA-A and/or DNA-B may cause hypovirulence, but DNA-C can counter this effect, indicating that DNA-A and/or DNA-B and DNA-C probably play important roles in changes of symptoms. FgGMTV1 cannot be transmitted through conidia in the absence of DNA-C, and DNA-C enhances the accumulation level of viral DNA in infected fungi; these observations suggest that DNA-C may be associated with viral movement and transmission and play important roles in the suppression of transcriptional or posttranscriptional gene silencing. However, it is unexpected that DNA-A and DNA-B cause more severe symptoms than the full set of the DNA components, which can replicate more efficiently (Figs. 3 and 4) . DNA-C can enhance the ecological fitness potential of FgGMTV1 by retaining the growth and conidiation levels of infected strains in comparison with virus-free fungal strains. Collectively, the results obtained here indicate that the combination of F. graminearum-FgGMTV1 will provide an excellent system for examining fungal and viral factors involved in virus-host interactions, although the full characterization of this pathosystem will require further work.",

Protoplasts were filtered into a 50-ml tube and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The protoplast pellet was washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold sorbitol-tris-calcium chloride (STC) buffer (1 M sorbitol, 50 mM tris with a pH value of 8.0, and 50 mM CaCl 2 \u20222H 2 O), centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, resuspended in 0.5 ml of STC, and kept on ice.",

After fungal isolates were grown on PDA plates for 5 days at 25\u00b0C, agar plugs with a diameter of 7 mm were cut from the actively growing margin and placed in the middle of a PDA plate. The growth rate of fungi was calculated by measuring colonial diameters daily after culturing for 4 days at 25\u00b0C. Three agar plugs were added to O-carboxymethylcellulose broth and cultured for 5 days, and conidial production was determined on blood count plates. For the virulence assay, 10 \uf06dl of conidial suspension (3 \u00d7 10 5 conidia/ml) or a small equisized mycelial plug was inoculated in the glume of a spikelet and cultured in the field for 15 days. At the end of the cultivation period, virulence was assessed by measuring the numbers of diseased spikelets per wheat head invaded. The infected glume was plucked from the spikelet, placed onto a PDA plate, and incubated for 3 to 5 days at 25\u00b0C. The generated fungi were transferred to PDA for subculture. Subsequently, the mycelial mass was collected for DNA extraction, followed by PCR using the indicated primer pairs (DNA-A-2F/2R for DNA-A, DNA-B-2F/2R for DNA-B, and DNA-C-2F/2R for DNA-C) (table S4) .",
