These experts assumed that smallpox was highly contagious and would therefore find isolated pockets of susceptible population. The committee emphasized the need to measure levels of immunity by developing methods of rapid and reliable assessment of vaccination coverage. Around the same time, jet injector technology was being developed for rapid point-of-collection immunization Roberto et al. 1969; Neff et al. 1969) . Coincidentally, trials in the early 1960s, which showed the safety and efficacy of measles vaccine in Africa, led many West African public health advocates to request assistance with measles control. (Meyer et al. 1964 ) These developments set the stage for the West African measles/smallpox campaign.",

The program used mobile teams going village to village, with collection point vaccination. Measles had a high case fatality rate in sub-Saharan Africa, about 5%. (Morley 1967) There was therefore considerable interest in the successful trial of measles vaccine in Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso). This led USAID to advocate a measles vaccination campaign through West Africa (Meyer et al. 1964) . CDC agreed to provide technical assistance to this campaign if smallpox eradication was added to the effort (Fenner et al. 1988 ). Simultaneous childhood measles and universal smallpox vaccination was started in 1967, using collection-point mass vaccination with jet injector guns as the main strategy. Collection point mass vaccination utilized the jet guns maximally, and helped the logistics of handling measles vaccine, which required careful refrigeration. The jet guns were cumbersome and made house-to-house visitation awkward. Collection point mass immunization and treatment methods had been successfully used throughout much of West Africa to control yellow fever and yaws, so that public health authorities were comfortable with mass vaccination concepts (Hopkins 1985; Tomori 2002) .",

Foege, who had agreed to head the smallpox and measles efforts in the Eastern State of Nigeria, detected a substantial epidemic of smallpox in several communities in Ogoja Province. The initial shipments of vaccine had not arrived. He called upon a network of friends and medical missionaries in the area, and suggested that they use their very limited supplies of vaccine to vaccinate close contacts of cases and possibly attenuate the outbreak. To his delight the outbreak was rapidly eliminated (Foege et al. 1975 ). In retrospect Dr C.W. Dixon had observed similar results in Tripolitania shortly after World War II. He rapidly eliminated a substantial outbreak among the Arab population with very limited supplies of glycerinated lymph vaccine. He vaccinated occupants of tents in which cases were found, telling his workers to vaccinate residents of surrounding tents only if there was sufficient vaccine. Dixon coined the term 'ring vaccination', which has become synonymous with the vaccination strategy of surveillance/containment (Dixon 1948) .",

Independent field assessment with a carefully drawn sample of the city showed that 88% of the population had been effectively vaccinated, with the major cutaneous reactions that WHO used as criteria for 'take'. Shortly thereafter there was an outbreak of 33 cases of smallpox in the city (Thompson and Foege 1968) .

Most transmission occurred during the first 5 or 6 days of the rash when the patient was prostrate and visibly ill. Secondary household attack rates among susceptibles were as low as 36% in the seasonal downswing of the disease, and the highest recorded was only 88% during the seasonal increase. Rarely did any patient spread smallpox to more than three other patients, perhaps in part because they were too sick to be effectively mobile (Rao et al. 1968; Mack et al. 1972; Sommer and Foster 1974; Heiner et al. 1971; Thomas et al. 1971) . Joint US, UK, and Indian researchers used plates of viral culture medium placed near patients in a smallpox hospital to show that viral shedding was detected only within 6 feet of the patient. Virus was not shed during the first 2 or 3 days of the prodrome when the patients were very ill, but had not yet developed an enanthem in the back of the nose and throat (Downie et al. 1965) .",

Foege and his colleagues reasoned that the relatively slow spread of smallpox, with the ease of aborting outbreaks by vaccination of contacts, made the disease susceptible to control by actively searching for cases and concentrating on vaccinating their household and village contacts. Foege was also impressed by the marked seasonality of the disease. He believed that if outbreaks could be found during the West African seasonal low in September through January, and chains of transmission broken by patient isolation and/or vaccination of close contacts, a large decrease in the seasonal high from February through June would result from a fairly small effort. In India less than 1% of villages were infected at any one time, suggesting that only modest numbers of vaccinations were necessary if reporting could be improved (National Institute of Communicable Diseases of India 1968). CDC thus laid plans for intensive active surveillance in the fall of 1968 and early winter of 1969 (Foege et al. 1971 ).",

Instead of relying on formal medical reports, CDC teams went to markets and schools, and showed pictures of typical cases of smallpox, inquiring whether anyone had seen similar patients in their village in recent weeks. They quickly learned that tribal and civil authorities knew more about the health conditions in the villages than the medical hierarchy. Surveillance became an active search, rather than passive reliance on traditional disease notification by medical personnel.",

Patient isolation can be very effective in controlling smallpox since patients are not infectious during the first 3 days or so of the prodrome, and transmission is usually only to contacts with prolonged direct face-to-face exposure. Indeed one experienced observer suggests that in developed countries smallpox could be eradicated by isolation alone (Mack 2003) . Many tribes in West Africa hid cases because they had learned that isolation in smallpox hospitals was tantamount to a death sentence. Medical and nursing care was poor in most African smallpox hospitals, and patients were not given good food and fluids. Family members could do a better job of nursing patients, and particularly feeding them, given that there was no actual therapy for smallpox. A system of home isolation with careful education of family members and villagers, coupled with vaccination of caregivers, replaced forced hospitalization.",

Figure 1 shows the secular trend of smallpox in the 19 nations of West and Central Africa, displayed on a semi-log scale as the ratio of observed cases to those expected from the mean of the 7 years from 1960 to 1967. This corrects for the sharp seasonal trend observed in the historical data. When active search began in the fall of 1968, there was an immediate increase in cases detected. This was followed by a rapid decline, with smallpox being finally eradicated more than 18 months in advance of the original target date (Foege et al. 1971; Foege 1996) In late 1967, during the tensions leading to, and then the actual conduct of, the Biafra Civil War, the Eastern State of Nigeria shifted from mass vaccination to surveillance and containment and interrupted transmission in just 5 months, with only 750 000 of the state's 12 million population vaccinated (Foege et al. 1975) . Sierra Leone had the highest incidence of reported smallpox in all of Africa in 1967, and started its mass vaccination program a year later than most of the other West African nations. It eradicated smallpox rapidly, and indeed three of its four largest outbreaks, and seven of its 13 administrative districts, cleared smallpox completely before the planned beginning of mass vaccinations (Hopkins et al. 1971) . Mali eradicated smallpox with barely 51% of its population vaccinated (Foege et al. 1975 ). There were similar success stories in Guinea, Togo, Upper Volta, and Northern Nigeria. ",

In the Indonesian province of West Java, a fortuitous experiment took place in which Bogor regency did surveillance/containment alone, Bandung regency did surveillance/containment combined with mass vaccination efforts aimed at reducing the backlog of unvaccinated population, and Tjirebon regency first did mass vaccination to reduce the backlog, followed by surveillance/containment.

If widespread simultaneous releases of large volumes of aerosolized smallpox took place in several cities, mass vaccination might become politically inevitable, but during the campaign contacts of known cases would still be ethically and epidemiologically the most important people to receive vaccination. Thus surveillance and containment methods would have to accompany any mass vaccination efforts, and should receive the highest priority. The post 9/11 efforts to create a cadre of vaccinated health care workers in the U.S. was not a mass vaccination effort, but rather an attempt to selectively immunize people known to be at high risk of exposure to smallpox in an attack given the frequency of nosocomial spread.
