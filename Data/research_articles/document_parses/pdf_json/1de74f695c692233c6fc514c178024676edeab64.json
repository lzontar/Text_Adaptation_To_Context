The study has other strengths, including being based on a well-characterized large communitybased sample. Additionally, study members were linked to objective measurement of the disease as opposed to self-report with confirmation of COVID-19 status being based on biological samples using PCR methodology, considered to be the gold standard. The study is not without its weaknesses. First, due to the absence of systematic testing across the UK, these data come from hospital records, therefore reflect only patients with a manifestation of the disease severe enough to require inpatient admission into hospital. Some cases of COVID-19 could also have been captured in patients originally hospitalised for reasons other than the infection. Second, the UK Biobank cohort is not representative of the general UK population. Therefore, absolute prevalence and risks should not be interpreted as such, but an aetiological investigation of risk factor association such as the present study are likely to be generalizable. 28 However, it is important to keep in mind that double selection of the sample -UK Biobank participants are not representative from the general population, and we selected a non-missing analytical sample within the cohort -may lead to collider bias. 29 This means that conditioning on factors associated with the selection of the sample can distort or induce spurious associations. For example, this is likely to have been the case in studies finding that current smokers appear protected against COVID-19. 30 In the present study, smoking (in particular ex-smokers) was associated with greater risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation, somewhat ruling out collider bias. Third, despite using an extensive set of socioeconomic factors, both at individual and area level, we failed to capture some features that may be particularly relevant to the ethnic differences observed in the COVID-19 pandemic context: occupation did not classify between public facing occupations, not only health professionals, but also supermarket clerks, bus drivers or couriers. The number of people in the household, while a proxy for overcrowding, does not capture intergenerational co-living. Finally, exposure data were collected a few years ago (2006-2010) and participants' health and living circumstances may have changed. Also, we excluded study members who had died prior to 5 th March 2020 because they could not contribute to the risk set, however, ascertainment of COVID-19 hospitalisation did not reliably begin until 16 th March.
