A 26-year-old man was referred to our hospital presenting with jaundice, lower limb edema, and dyspnea. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with spur cell anemia related to alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Spur cell anemia is an independent predictor of mortality in liver cirrhosis and has been associated with extremely poor prognosis. The most effective treatment for spur cell anemia is liver transplantation. As seen in the literature, the treatment of spur cell anemia without liver transplantation is quite challenging. This report highlights the importance of management and treatment strategies, including control of fluid retention, blood transfusion, plasma diafiltration, and administration of diuretics. Our treatment strategies might be useful in patients who are not candidate of liver transplantation or patients waiting for liver transplantation.",

            "text": "Anemia of diverse etiology is commonly seen in patients with liver cirrhosis. Causes of anemia related to liver cirrhosis are complex and multifactorial. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage secondary to the formation of esophageal and gastric varices, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders are some of the major and life-threatening causes of anemia in liver cirrhosis [1, 2] . In addition, in patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension gastropathy and gastric vascular ectasia are common causes of chronic anemia [3] . Gastrointestinal hemorrhage may also lead to iron-deficiency anemia in cirrhosis [4] . Hemolysis secondary to splenomegaly, caused by portal hypertension, may lead to increased plasma volume, macrocytosis, and megaloblastic anemia [5] . In addition, autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with autoimmune hepatitis [6] , Wilson's disease with increased non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper released from impaired hepatocytes [7] , Zieve's syndrome [8] , and spur cell anemia (SCA) [9] are all causes of hemolytic anemia associated with liver disease. Aplastic anemia, characterized by the development of pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow, is sometimes associated with hepatitis [10] . Alcoholic liver disease is one of the major causes of liver cirrhosis. Alcohol is known to be toxic to the bone marrow, and up to 60% of alcoholics with cirrhosis also have some degree of malnutrition, which may lead to anemia (e.g., folic acid deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency) [11] (Table 1) .",

Laboratory test and computed tomography (CT) a year prior to hospitalization showed alcoholic liver disease without decompensated liver cirrhosis. The patient had no familial predisposition to the disease and no past surgical history, history of pancreatitis, or history of blood transfusion. He had jaundice, lower limb edema, and dyspnea since 2 months prior to hospital referral. Despite the progressive increase in symptoms, he did not stop drinking until 1 week prior to referral, by which time he had difficulty in walking due to the lower limb edema and dyspnea. He then visited another hospital before being referred to our hospital. At the time of arrival, the patient was jaundiced, had conjunctival anemia and systemic edema which was especially severe in the lower limbs. The patient was also hypoxemic, and was administered nasal oxygen at 2 L/min. Laboratory test (Table 2) results revealed severe liver dysfunction [Child-Pugh score 11 points, Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score 24 points, MELD-Na score 28 points] with a total bilirubin of 12.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 5.4 mg/dL, prothrombin time of 30%, and Mac-2 binding protein glycan isomer of 12.16 COI. Brain natriuretic peptide levels were elevated. In addition, the patient had a hemoglobin level of 2.1 g/dL with macrocytic anemia, and a peripheral blood smear revealed the presence of a large number of spur cells (Fig. 1 ). Haptoglobin was decreased, despite direct and indirect Coombs tests results being normal. No abnormality was detected in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and bone marrow examination. Chest CT revealed pleural effusion and ground-glass opacity with partial consolidation, suggesting pulmonary edema (Fig. 2a) , whilst contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed chronic liver disease and ascites estimated to be less than 1 L without portal vein thrombosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (Fig. 2b ). Pathological findings of liver biopsy were consistent with advanced alcoholic liver cirrhosis ( Fig. 3a-c) .",

In addition, he was supplemented with branched-chain amino acid, levocarnitine, rifaximin, zinc, folic acid, vitamin B1, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and vitamin B12. Whilst treatment, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio decreased to 100 and the diagnosis of acute pulmonary respiratory distress was established, so a decision was made to intubate the patient. Hemoglobin level modification was necessary to improve oxygenation. Large amounts of blood transfusions were thought to worsen pulmonary edema, so plasma diafiltration (PDF) was performed during blood transfusion. The PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio improved to > 200, and the furosemide dose was increased to decrease pulmonary edema. The patient experienced a rapid decrease in body weight and was consequently weaned off from ventilatory support. Although MELD score did not improve, there was improvement in anemia and respiratory failure (Fig. 4) . The patient was discharged and advised to abstain from alcohol. Laboratory test at the time of discharge showed improvement of hemoglobin level (Hb 8.7 g/dL) and slight improvement of bilirubin level (Total-bilirubin 9.5 mg/ dL, Direct-bilirubin 3.7 mg/dL). Liver function was also improved compared to that on admission (Child-Pugh score 9 points, MELD score 19 points, MELD-Na score 23 points).

            "text": "Alexopoulou et al. also reported that in multivariate analysis, SCA was an independent predictor of mortality, and survival rate of patients with SCA at the first, second, and third month of follow-up was 77%, 45%, and 33%, respectively, with a median reported survival of 1.9 months [22] . (Table 3 ) [13, 14, 16, 19, 20, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . On reviewing these cases, the average age was 42.6 years old, and 14 (53.8%) of the 26 patients were men. Most of the cases lack the data of severity of liver disease, such as Child-Pugh score and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Though, assessable cases had severe liver disease with average Child-Pugh score 11 points, and average MELD score 26.3 points. The average hemoglobin level was 7.5 g/dL and our case had the lowest hemoglobin level. Patients underwent liver transplantation experienced recovery of SCA and had good prognosis. However, patients without liver transplantation had poor survival time (from 2 weeks to 5 months), except for our case (doing well for a year without aggravation of liver disease and hemoglobin level). As seen in the literature, the prognosis of SCA is extremely poor and management of SCA is essential for better survival in end stage liver cirrhosis. As for treatment, abstinence from alcohol is required to avoid the progression of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Liver transplantation remains the only curative treatment for reversing SCA [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , and very few attempts have been made for treatment without liver transplantation. Flunarizine is reported to impair the morphological abnormality of red blood cells, and two cases of SCA treated by flunarizine are reported. In addition, there has been a case of SCA that was treated by combination therapy comprising [40] flunarizine, pentoxifylline, and cholestyramine, although flunarizine and pentoxifylline had to be discontinued 6 months later due to adverse events [35] . High-dose steroids were also reported to be effective in improving anemia in SCA [25] . Plasmapheresis has been reported to improve dyslipidemia in SCA (increase in concentrations of total cholesterol, phospholipids, and apo-AI), and as an effective treatment of SCA [24] . However, the precise mechanism of effectiveness in these cases is still unknown, and liver transplantation is the only curative treatment to reverse the morphological feature of SCA. In our case, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred secondary to SCA related to alcoholic liver disease. There are several causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome considered in our case. First, there was a possibility of acuteon-chronic liver failure in our case [41] . Acute-on-chronic liver failure patients experience systematic inflammatory response syndrome because of cytokine storm in relation acute insult and/or subsequent development of sepsis [42] . In our case, blood culture remained negative, so sterile inflammation response or occult infection could be considered. However, our case was not visiting our hospital regularly and we lacked the laboratory data for the diagnosis of acuteon-chronic liver failure in Japan. Secondary, fluid retention (e.g., ascites, pleural effusion, edema) are common complications of end stage liver cirrhosis, and could cause respiratory failure. The mechanism of fluid retention in cirrhosis is complicated, although the major causes can be explained by malnutrition and increased activity in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which leads to hyperdynamic circulation [43, 44] .",

Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment of spur cell anemia. According to the Japan society of hepatology, the candidate of liver transplantation should be considered by liver function (Child-Pugh score 10 points or more, of MELD score), period of alcohol abstinence (more than 18 months), and hepatocellular carcinoma (within the Milan criteria [45] or within the 5-5-500 rule [46] ). When the patient is not a candidate of liver transplantation, SCA, which could be accompanied with fluid retention, organ failure, such as liver failure, respiratory failure (aggravated by aggressive transfusion), must be managed by preserved treatment. During treatment, nutrition support for liver failure, respiratory care, including intubation, for respiratory failure, and fluid retention control, including diuretics, albumin infusion, plasma diafiltration (PDF), was helpful (Fig. 6 ). In addition, PDF, a blood purification therapy in which simple plasma exchange is performed using a selective plasma separator while the dialysate flows outside the hollow fibers [47] , was useful in the removal of water-soluble and albumin-bound toxins [47] . The benefit of PDF compared to simplex plasma exchange is that PDF enabled the performance of dialysis simultaneously with plasma exchange, without worsening fluid retention [47] .",

However, recent diagnostic criteria of SCA do not include these laboratory data [22] . Finally, although our treatment strategies successfully managed severe SCA with alcoholic liver cirrhosis, SCA could not be reversed without liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is essential in severe SCA accompanied by worse liver function as curative treatment, and clinicians should look for the possibility of liver transplantation in candidates of liver cirrhosis. Our managing strategies might be useful in patients with SCA who is not a candidate of liver transplantation or patients waiting for liver transplantation.",
