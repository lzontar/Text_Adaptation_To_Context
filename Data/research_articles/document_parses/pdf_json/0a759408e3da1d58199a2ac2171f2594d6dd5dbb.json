Sera from 11 of 43 (26 per cent) patients with suspected virus infection were also positive. Interferon was detected in tile sera of volunteers infected with respiratory viruses in strict isolation. It is suggested that the test might be used to supplement conventional tests for virus infections, and with modification may provide a useful diagnostic aid.",

Although interferon was not found in patients who were thought to have bacterial infections it is now know-n that bacterial infections can induce interferon (4) . it is perhaps because of this knowledge that there has been no great enthusiasm for exploiting the idea of using a test for interferon in the blood as a rapid and general test for virus infection. We have therefore reinvestigated the problem to see if interferon is indeed found in virus infections and not in bacterial disease, and if so, whether it is found often enough to justify developing a better test for circulating interferon for use in diagnosis.",

After incubation for three days the monoIayers were fixed and sterilised with formalin and stained with crystal violet. A 50 per cent reduction in mean plaque count was regarded as indicating the presence of interferon. All positive results were confirmed by repeat tests. The serum was titrated for the presence of interferon and the titres ranged from 1:20 to 1:800. Some adult sera were brought to pH 2 and back to p H 7.4 after dilution but it was impractical to show that the inhibitor in these sera had other properties of interferon; but, all showed the most important property of priming cells to resist virus infection and there is little doubt that the inhibitor was interferon. Parallel tests with dilutions of laboratory standard leucocyte interferon were included in all assays and showed that our test detected between 0. I and 1.0 reference units of interferon per millilitre of serum dilution tested (reference standard B69/19).",

The sera were collected and handled like tile \"acute\" serum for standard virus serology. We found no positive results in patients with other severe illness including bacterial infections, but about a quarter of patients in whom a clinical diagnosis of a virus infection was not confirmed nevertheless had a positive serum. It eould be that some of the eases thought clinically to be virus infections were actually other infeetions or immunological in nature but they may have been infected with viruses--for example, coronaviruses and rhinoviruses would not be detected by the standard battery of diagnostic tests used. Virus infection was diagnosed by eomplement fixation tests on acute and convalescent sera and isolation by inoculation of the specimens into three lines of tissue culture cells. The correlation of a positive interferon test with virus infection is confirmed by the results in sera taken from volunteers who were infected in strict isolation (6) . This result had been obtained previously in a study using a different method of interferon assay (5) which detected interferon by :means of a rhinovirus and Sindbis virus in human fibroblasts and V3 cells respectively. Thus it is not necessary to use VSV in the assay--tests with viruses which are not restricted to approved laboratories could be used. Our results also follow the general tendency for interferon to be detected more often in more severe illnesses.",
