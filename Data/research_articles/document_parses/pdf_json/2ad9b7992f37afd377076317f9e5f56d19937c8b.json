Trying to disassemble the trimeric structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, we analyzed single protomer surfaces searching for concave moieties that are located at the three protomer-protomer interfaces. The presence of some druggable pockets at these interfaces suggested that some of the available drugs in Drug Bank could destabilize the quaternary spike glycoprotein formation by binding to these pockets, therefore interfering with COVID-19 life cycle.
