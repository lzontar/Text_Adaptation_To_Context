            "text": "Lessons learned for all viral pandemic challenges Before the ravaging appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza viruses have been among the major players in the history of health disasters over the past century. 1, 2 Because the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic claimed more than 50 million lives followed by annual resurgence of varying degrees of morbidity and mortality, the influenza vaccine program has driven platform development and global collaborative surveillance networks. These networks support the definition of antigenic shifts that drive annual vaccine specificities for manufacturing responses. Lessons learned about immune responses to viral pathogens, the constant and evolving challenges of viral genomic adjustments that potentially enhance pathogenicity, and the search for vaccine constructs with greater efficacy and potentially more durable protection can all be applied to the urgent need for coronavirus-specific vaccines. The predator-prey relationship between influenza viruses and humans is certainly applicable and relevant to the rapidly evolving pandemic dance led by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. 2 It is noteworthy that unlike influenza viruses (that rapidly adapt to the hosts' humoral immune responses), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 may have some antigenic stability so that a vaccine may not require annual dosing. 3 There are a vast number of coronaviruses, and it is a reasonable concern that other coronavirus threats may develop in the future. The science and the public health infrastructure built in response to influenza's seasonal challenges represent a wise resource investment that can affect our ability to respond to any infectious disease threat and merits strong ongoing support in future years as a critical and enduring emergency preparedness investment.",

For influenza A, 3 host genetic factors have been identified that correlate with increased risk for mortality, which are as follows: loss of gene product or substantial reduction in gene function for the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 7 and interferon regulatory factor 9; key regulators of type I interferon response; and GATA2, a zinc-finger transcription factor affecting survival of long-term memory T and B cells. 7 There is a need for long-term investments in research that detail inhibitory viral factors and host genomic interactions with intracellular infection (including the pathways and key factors that increase or decrease effective immunity). The growth of knowledge derived from cohesive long-term multidisciplinary global collaborations and network infrastructure is critical to providing a trail of \"bread crumbs\" for potential future therapies that may be viral family specific even when antigenic viral envelopes change over time.",

However, in the context of biodiversity and personalized medicine challenges, stronger adjuvants may interact with some host immune systems in ways that could affect risk for adverse events (eg, autoimmunity) or immune responses that may facilitate viral infection or pathogenesis (antibody-dependent enhancement). 8 The challenges for public health in a world containing a large landscape of respiratory viruses that can cripple both a population and an economy are not political issues and require mindful attention for the \"long haul\" and not spurts of crisis management.",

Given the large population with vitamin D insufficiency alone, this nutritional factor amenable to supplementation may contribute to improved population health in the face of both influenza and coronavirus infections. 10 The issues surrounding influenza's seasonal and potentially pandemic health threat prevention and management are relevant to any human viral threat, including the current pandemic. With growing problems evolving from distrust of science and facts and those who represent that platform of human endeavor, there is an urgent need to support the scientific and medical care communities in the challenges of education and building bridges of understanding with leaders and populations as a whole regarding the lessons of history, the already existing established knowledge base, and the ongoing needs for public health infrastructure and research. Given that we have moved beyond a paternalistic health care system to recognizing that patients and their advocates have to be included as part of the team for optimum care and to understand preferences, research into broader aspects of health and immune resistance that empower individual healthy choices and options are also needed.",
