To elucidate possible functions of 33 lncRNAs in the COVID-19 pathobiology, we have utilized RNA-seq dataset of SARS-CoV-2 34 infected lung epithelial cells. 35 Results: Our analyses uncover 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs whose functions are 36 broadly involved in cell survival and regulation of gene expression. By network enrichment 37 analysis we find that these lncRNAs can directly interact with differentially expressed 38 protein-coding genes ADAR, EDN1, KYNU, MALL, TLR2 and YWHAG; and also AKAP8L, 39 EXOSC5, GDF15, HECTD1, LARP4B, LARP7, MIPOL1, UPF1, MOV10 and PRKAR2A, 40 host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These genes are involved in cellular 41 signaling, metabolism, immune response and RNA homeostasis. Since lncRNAs have been 42 known to sponge microRNAs and protect expression of upregulated genes, we also identified 43 9 microRNAs that are induced in viral infections; however, some lncRNAs are able to block 44 their usual suppressive effect on overexpressed genes and consequently contribute to host 45 defense and cell survival. 46 Conclusions: Our investigation determines that deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 47 infection are involved in viral proliferation, cellular survival, and immune response, 48 ultimately determining disease outcome and this information could drive the search for novel 49 RNA therapeutics as a treatment option. 50 51 52 53 54 Keywords 55 COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, LncRNA, miRNA, Long noncoding RNA, viral pathogenesis 56 AS1 (Figure 2).

"67 epithelial cells trigger innate immune pathways, leading to immune effector cells releasing 68 high levels chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines and resultant unconfined or 69 uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response leads to fatality (6, 7). Recent studies also 70 indicate the virus may cause viral sepsis (8) and infection can lead to deregulation in blood 71 coagulation (9, 10). But no one conjecture has been able to formulate a clear and concise 72 explanation of how the virus spreads so effectively and affects so profoundly. With 73 emergence of more and more data, new dimensions arise as possible modes of pathogenesis 74 and progression of infection. 75 Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), RNAs that do not code for any proteins, are key players in the 76 regulation of gene expression and influence the interplay involved in host defense 77 mechanisms (11). Regulatory ncRNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding 78 RNAs (lncRNAs) act as important regulators of the cellular antiviral response. Consequently, 79 viruses have been found to utilize cellular ncRNA to evade immune response and exploit 80 cellular machinery to their advantage (12). 81 LncRNAs are a type of non-coding RNA having a size of more than 200 nts that can function 82 as primary or spliced transcripts (13). LncRNAs have become increasingly crucial in 83 explaining cellular processes and understanding molecular progression of diseases. They may 84 regulate gene expression through epigenetic modification of chromatin structure, 85 transcriptional control, regulation of gene transcription via direct binding or transcription 86 factor recruitment and post-transcriptional processing through protein-RNA interaction (14-87 16). Additionally, lncRNAs may function as competing endogenous RNAs (17) to function as 88 regulators of microRNA targeting of genes involved in important pathways. 89 Previous studies have found lncRNAs to be involved in viral infection and subsequent host 90 response (18-20). A wide selection of lncRNAs get aberrantly modulated in many viral 91 infections like-HSV, Influenza, HIV, HSV etc (21). Upon viral infections, dysregulation of 92 cellular lncRNAs occur which in turn abnormally regulates several host processes resulting in 93 the progression of the viral infection (20). Apart from the general host routes, abnormalities 94 in the expression of lncRNAs mainly affect host's different antiviral innate immune 95 responses, particularly interferon signaling and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (20, 21). Even in 96 SARS-CoV infection, Peng et al. showed that differential expression of lncRNAs could 97 aberrantly regulate several host responses along with the innate immune signaling (22), 98 which suggests a similar deregulation pattern of lncRNAs could also occur in SARS-Melo et al. (23) investigated the host response to SARS-CoV-2 by infecting primary 101 human lung epithelium (NHBE) cells and A549 alveolar cell lines with the virus and 102", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "ADAR interacts directly with downregulated KCNQ1OT1 and GAS6-AS1, and 126 upregulated MEG3 and INHBA-AS1 (Figure 2). ADAR also interacts with UPF1 and MOV10 127 -two proteins which were also interactors of other DE lncRNAs. EDN1 is found to be 128 upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which interacts directly with downregulated UGDH-129 Discussion 242 Long noncoding RNAs are regulators and modulators of complex cellular pathways and viral 243 infection is no exception (19, 20). Dysregulation of lncRNA expression and interaction, 244 either directly with viral RNA, or indirectly with host RNA, affect the progression of viral 245 infection (12). LncRNAs can work as a sponge for miRNA, bind protein as a competitive 246 inhibitor, inhibit protein-protein interaction, influence post-translational modification, or 247 affect the activity of target protein. They can modulate viral life cycle, regulate innate 248 immune response, or assist adaptive immunity (18, 48). In our exploration of the deregulated 249 lncRNA in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cells, all of these functionalities come to fore. In 250 our study, lncRNA-interacting DE protein-coding genes and SARS-CoV-2 protein interactors 251 were involved in various pathways. Both RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions were 252 present, indicating a complex interplay between the components involved. We also looked for 253 possible lncRNAs exerting effects as competing endogenous RNAs to ensure a particular 254 miRNA does not downregulate a gene. In turn, the upregulated genes play a crucial role in 255 viral replication, disease progression, and immune response. Although some of these 256 miRNAs also target a few downregulated genes, their decrease in expression may be 257 controlled by separate mechanisms. Our findings shed light on the possible role of DE 258 lncRNAs in specific processes involved with viral infection, proliferation and cellular 259 response. 260 SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7-Nsp8-Nsp12 proteins interact to form a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis 261 complex, where Nsp12 works as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. EXOSC5, interactor 262 of Nsp8 protein, is a non-catalytic component of the RNA exosome complex. RNA exosome 263 complex is involved in 3\u2032 processing of various stable RNA species and is crucial for RNA 264 quality control in the nucleus (49), thus Nsp8 binding may be fundamental to diminishing the 265 capacity of exosome to act against viral mRNAs. Antiviral drug Remdesivir has been 266 predicted to target and disassemble this complex (50, 51). Interaction of EXOSC5 protein 267 with KCNQ1OT1 and SNHG8 can modulate this interaction. The putative RNA-RNA 268 interaction between upregulated AC006058.1 and MALL mRNA, a gene involved in 269 cholesterol homeostasis and membrane trafficking, can exert an influence in maturation of 270 SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped virus. FAM230J, which has no reported function, is 271 downregulated in the infected cells. Its absence may activate the upregulated KYNU, which is 272 involved in metabolite biosynthesis pathways, through lack of RNA-RNA interaction. Host RNA-binding proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins are involved in 274 regulating viral transcription and mRNA stability. SARS-CoV-2 N protein interacts with 275 UPF1 and MOV10. In case for murine hepatitis virus, a model coronavirus, the N protein 276 carries out this interaction to inhibit nonsense-mediated decay of viral mRNAs containing 277 multiple stop codons, thus favoring viral mRNA transcription. NMD pathways recognized 278 cytoplasmic viral mRNAs as a substrate for degradation, but viral replication induced the 279 inhibition of the NMD pathway through N protein (52). In human T-lymphotropic virus type 280 1 (HTLV-1)-infected cells, viral protein Tax bound to components of NMD pathways, 281 including UPF1, to inhibit the process (53). SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacts with 282 AKAP8L, which assists in viral infection progression through favoring transcription. Both 283 LARP7 (nsp8 interactor) and LARP4B (nsp12 interactor) are RNA-binding proteins involved 284 in RNA transcription regulation. Interaction of these RNA-binding proteins with the DE 285 lncRNAs may be crucial for viral mRNA transcription and stability against cellular defense. 286 ADAR can be regarded as the \"Editor-in-Chief\" of innate immunity against viral infection 287 (54), thus the protein's interaction with both upregulated and downregulated lncRNAs may 288 hold crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. MEG3 was found to act as a biomarker 289 and regulate cell functions by targeting ADAR in colorectal cancer (CRC). The cells 290 overexpressing MEG3 exhibited increased ADAR expression, and downregulation of MEG3 291 was found in CRC tissues, cell lines and serum (55). In the infected cells, MEG3 upregulation 292 may lead to ADAR overexpression, which could have been favorable to the virus, as 293 evidenced in Influenza A (56). INHBA-AS1 upregulation in virus-infected cells may also 294 contribute to cell survival through interaction with ADAR, as evidenced in gastric cancer (57) 295 and oral squamous cell carcinoma (58). 296Cell survival can be both beneficial to virus and be inhibitory. Viruses need the cell to 297 survive certain period to undergo replication, but they also need apoptosis to exit the cell and 298 infect others. Thus, cell survival and apoptosis becomes a key indicator of pathogenesis. 299Among lncRNAs, downregulated SNHG8 has possible link to apoptosis and cell death (59), 300 as does KCNQ1OT1 (60-63). Unlike both, downregulation of GAS6-AS1 may be linked with 301 cell proliferation and survival (64, 65). All three interact with YWHAG, which is involved in 302 signal transduction. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling, Wnt signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt 303 signaling, involved in cell survival, are also protected by probable ceRNA function by 304 lncRNA.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "313 TLR2, as part of the innate immune response, has been connected to antiviral action against 314 multiple viral infections (66-69). KCNQ1OT1, the lncRNA having putative RNA-RNA 315 interation with TLR2, was found to attenuate sepsis-induced myocardial injury via regulating 316 miR-192-5p/XIAP axis. Downregulation of the lncRNA advanced cardiac injury by allowing 317 miR-192-5p to target XIAP(70). XIAP functions in the inhibition of apoptosis, whereas TLR2 318 is known to promote apoptosis. The downregulation of KCNQ1OT1 in infected cells thus will 319 promote apoptosis, in accordance with its interaction with overexpressed TLR2 mRNA. 320 Response by NF-\u03baB signaling pathway against the viral infection is probably protected by 321 lncRNA against inhibition by virally-induced miRNAs. 322 DE lncRNAs also had probable involvement in regulating cellular processes, including 323 signaling. The downregulation of UGDH-AS1 can be related to EDN1 overexpression, which 324 can be crucial in vasoconstriction, leading to severe symptoms, as seen in SARS-CoV-2 325 infections (71). SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 protein works as a viral helicase, and interacts with 326 MIPOL1 and PRKAR2A. Function of MIPOL1 is unclear, whereas PRKAR2A is involved in 327 cAMP-mediated signaling, which is the probable target for modulation by Nsp13. The RNA-328 RNA interactions of downregulated KCNQ1OT1 with the mRNAs of these two genes may 329 have implications on viral infection progression. Additionally, MAPK pathway is probably 330 regulated through lncRNA involvement. 331 From literature, it was confirmed that KCNQ1OT1 (72) and MEG3 (73) both can act as 332 probable ceRNA targets for miR-185-5p, whereas MEG3 can act as a ceRNA for let-7c-5p 333 (74). This proves the existence of an expanded role of these lncRNAs in infected cells. 334 Conclusions 335 Our findings explore the molecular footprint of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the lens of 336 lncRNAs. The integrated analysis has linked multiple actors in the complex interplay of 337 molecules in exacerbating the infection and identified possible drug targets. We trace the 338 involvement of lncRNAs with cellular behavior in this situation and illuminate their role in 339 cell survival, viral replicaion, and immune defense. The lethality and swift transmission of 340 this virus is entwined with the deregulated cellular environment, and lncRNA regulation is 341 crucial for understanding its parameters. Our results could provide insights for scheming 342 some novel RNA therapeutics during the lacking of effective cure option. 343 Methods 344 Identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs 345 Illumina sequenced RNA-seq raw FastQ reads were extracted from GEO database accession: 346 GSE147507 (75). This data include independent biological triplicates of primary human lung 347 epithelium (NHBE) which were mock treated or infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 24hrs. 348 Mapping of reads was done with TopHat (tophat v2.1.1 with Bowtie v2.4.1) (76). Short reads 349 were uniquely aligned allowing at best two mismatches to the latest version human reference 350 genome from (GRCh38) as downloaded from USCS database (77). Sequence matched 351 exactly more than one place with equally quality were discarded to avoid bias (78). The reads 352 that were not mapped to the genome were utilized to map against the transcriptome (junctions 353 mapping). Latest version of Ensembl gene model (79) (version 99, as extracted from UCSC) 354 was used for this process. After mapping, we used SubRead package featureCount v2.21 (80) 355 to calculate absolute read abundance (read count, rc) for each transcript/gene associated to the 356 Ensembl genes. For differential expression (DE) analysis we used DESeq2 v1.26.0 with R 357 v3.6.2 (2019-07-05) (81) that uses a model based on the negative binomial distribution. To 358 avoid false positive, we considered only those transcripts where at least 10 reads were 359 annotated in at least one of the samples used in this study. 360 Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction 361 From RNA-seq data analysis, identified differentially expressed 638 protein-coding genes 362 and recently reported 332 SARS-CoV-2 protein interactors by Gordon et al. (25) were used in 363 combination to build PPI network. Edge information for the network built with these proteins 364 were extracted from the STRING (82) database. Interactions with high confidence (score >0.700) were selected and retrieved. A network file was prepared in SIF format of RNA-RNA interactions and lncRNA functions 368 RNA-RNA interactions between the DE lncRNAs and other RNAs were retrieved from 369 NPInter v4.0 (84). The interacting RNAs were searched for identified DE protein-coding 370 genes and viral protein-interactor genes. Functions of the DE lncRNAs were retrieved from 371 LncBook (85). The viral proteins that bind to proteins with lncRNA interactors were also 372 identified. 373 Identification of virally-induced miRNAs 374 miRwayDB(31) was utilized to look for miRNAs involved in viral-mediated disease. 375 Additionally, host miRNAs involved in viral infection as identified by Girardi et al. (32) and 376 microRNAs in viral acute respiratory infections as described by Leon-Icaza et al. (33) were 377 retrieved. These miRNAs were manually curated for their involvement in viral pathogenesis 378 and possible connection to SARS-CoV-2. 379Extraction of microRNA targets 380Gene targets for the curated set of miRNAs were retrieved from experimentally validated 381 miRTarBase (86) and filtered for DE protein-coding genes. DIANA-LncBase v3 (87) was 382 used to retrieve miRNAs that target the DE lncRNAs, with high-confidence interactions 383 considered only. The lists were combined to identify the miRNAs that target both DE 384 protein-coding genes and lncRNAs.
