            "text": "Ride-sourcing has recently been at the centre of attention as the most disruptive mode of transport associated with the so-called shared mobility era. Drivers, riders, the platform, policymakers, and the general public are considered as the main stakeholders of the system. While ride-sourcing platforms have been growing, so did the heightened tension between them and their drivers. That is why understanding drivers' behaviour and preferences is of key importance to ride-sourcing companies in managing their relationship with drivers (also known as driver-partners) and in retaining them in the presence of competence. Ride-sourcing drivers are not only chauffeurs but fleet owners. They can make various operational and tactical decisions that directly influence other stakeholders and the transport system performance as a whole. Conducting a series of focus groups with ride-sourcing drivers in the Netherlands, we have studied their opinions about the system functionalities as well as their possible interactions with the platform and wishes for changes. The focus group results suggest that the main decisions of drivers, which are ride acceptance, relocation strategies, working shift and area in which to work, could be affected by many elements depending on platform strategies, drivers' characteristics, riders' attributes, and exogenous factors. We find that part-time and full-time drivers, as well as experienced and beginning drivers, are characterized by distinctive behaviour. Flexibility and freedom were mentioned as the key reasons for joining the platform while an unfair reputation system, unreliable navigation algorithm, high competition between drivers, passenger-oriented platform, high-commission fee, and misleading guidance were acknowledged as being the main system drawbacks. Based on our findings, we propose a conceptual model that frames the relationship between the tactical and operational decisions of drivers and related factors.",

Ride-sourcing companies, also known as \"Transportation Network Companies (TNCs)\", have emerged as one of the frontiers in the shared mobility space and can potentially shift mobility from a vehicle ownership model to service-based operations. By definition, ride-sourcing is a digital platform supplied by private car owners to offer on-demand door-to-door transport services to users requesting rides. Therefore, it is able to possibly address the transportation needs of travellers by offering seamless and efficient mobility solutions. Notwithstanding, there are also intense debates concerning the deficiencies and pitfalls of ride-sourcing services such as their contribution to traffic congestion, discrimination, and air pollution (Shen, Zou, Lin, & Liu, 2020) . This raises awareness of the possible system issues and the relevance of these services as well as the operations and potential regulation thereof for developing a sustainable urban mobility policy.",

Thousands of drivers frequently strike for improving their working conditions all around the world. They believe that their needs and expectations are overlooked by the platform.

They have mostly assumed that drivers are fully compliant with the platform or considered a few monetary variables including hourly income as the factors influencing their choices though many variables such as the cumulative revenue, working shift, the aversion to long working hours, driving costs, information sharing and incentives may presumably impact the decisions of drivers, yet remaining hitherto unexplored in the literature. This arguably stems from the lack of knowledge on the aspects considered by drivers and their potential impact on their behaviour and decisions. Furthermore, many studies have hypothesized that on-demand transport services are operated by a centrally fully automated fleet of vehicles, so-called taxi robots (Ciari, Janzen, & Ziemlicki, 2020; H\u00f6rl, Ruch, Becker, Frazzoli, & Axhausen, 2019; Levin, 2017; Liang, de Almeida Correi, An, & van Arem, 2020; Oh, Seshadri, Le, Zegras, & Ben-Akiva, 2020; Winter, Cats, Martens, & van Arem, 2020) .

Wang and Smart (2020) analysed an extracted sample of 18,399 for-hire vehicle drivers working in the United States from 12-year Integrated Public Use Microdata Series data. They report that the hourly income of for-hire vehicle drivers has decreased since the entry of Uber to the market. The key objective of modelling driver supply is to investigate the main reasons why drivers join the system. Analysing the characteristics of Uber drivers through the Uber administrative data and surveys, Hall and Krueger (2018) conclude that flexibility is the main factor attracting drivers to work for Uber to start with. With regard to supply elasticity, the effects of monetary measures such as hourly income on the working shift of drivers are studied. Cahuc, Carcillo, and Zylberberg (2014) argue that income rate impacts both the decision to join the platform as well as the number of working hours. Using New York City taxi driver data, Farber (2015) found out that drivers have a positive elasticity which means that they typically work longer hours when income rates are higher in line with expectations. Moreover, several studies have investigated the effect of wages and incentives on the supply-side operation of ride-sourcing platforms. For instance, Leng, Du, Wang, Li, and Xiong (2016) analyses the response of drivers to monetary promotions given by two competing ride-sourcing platforms in China. They reported that the number of trips per day increases and the idle time decreases during the promotion.",

In general, drivers are free to decide whether and when to join the system, to accept/decline ride requests, and about their relocation strategies in order to cover more profit/satisfying periods. This freedom provides drivers with a range of choices that can directly influence their income level as well as system performance. For example, the low ride request acceptance rate of drivers in a region might increase the waiting time for riders in that area (lower level of service). In another scenario, if no driver accepts an incoming ride request or to be available at a particular location/time, the request is aborted resulting in the dissatisfaction of the client. This highlights the fundamental role of service suppliers in the ride-sourcing environment. Hence, in order to control the supply-side dynamics, the drivers' behaviour and perceptions towards the platform strategies need to be unravelled. This also provides an opportunity to address the issues that drivers face which could lead to decreasing the existing tensions with the platforms and thus break the barriers to fully realize the potential benefits of ride-sourcing. To this end, this study aims at gaining indepth knowledge about ride-sourcing drivers' decisions and their relations with system functionalities.",

ViaVan has only recently entered the market (early 2018), offering solely shared rides and its operations are limited to the Amsterdam area. Ride-sourcing is generally more regulated in Europe than elsewhere, especially in the Netherlands where drivers need to be registered as professional drivers.

Part-time drivers are defined as the ones who have other occupations while full-time drivers spend their whole working time in the platform.

On the other hand, prior knowledge of the moderator can have some added value to foster the group dynamics. In order to obtain a balance between the moderator bias and having enough background knowledge, we had several joint meetings with the independent moderator to brief her and also provided her with a semi-structured moderation guide to ensure the research objectives could be achieved. Besides, the first author followed all the focus groups' discussions in an observation room in real-time. He was able to see and hear the participants while they could not see him thanks to a one-way mirror. In several situations during the sessions, the first author contacted the moderator for asking some follow-up questions. However, she was fully authorized to refuse to ask any leading questions raised by him during the discussions. It should be noted that at the beginning of each session, participants were informed about his presence (as a researcher from a Dutch university) behind the one-way mirror and the relevant reasons for that.

However, the cancellation has some consequences (to be discussed below). In case of not accepting the request, the driver waits for the next possible request or ends his working shift. The main question is that what kind of information is shown to drivers when a request appears? In the focus group, we asked the drivers to clarify it and express their opinions. a) Information sharing policy: Currently, drivers are provided with limited information. They are able to see the pick-up point address, the distance and predicted travel time between their location and the pick-up point, and the rider's rating. Trip fare and the final destination are not shown to drivers. They cannot see the destination immediately after accepting the request. Instead, the destination pops up when the driver approaches the rider. This is presumably because the probability of cancelling the request by the driver decreases given that he has already driven some kilometres to pick-up the passenger. Thus, if he/she cancels the request at this stage, he/she has earned nothing. Most drivers stated that they found it difficult to make a decision about the request given the limited data available upfront.",

There is a threshold of a maximum three cancellations per day and drivers need to explain why an accepted request has been cancelled. If a driver exceeds the maximum, he/she gets a warning.

This working time limit excludes the period when the driver is offline or he/she stops somewhere and wait for the next trip. Some drivers pointed to this rule as a strict policy which reduces their flexibility, but it seems that there is a misunderstanding.

It is calculated by dividing the amount of time the vehicle is occupied by the total working shift duration. a) Weekday versus weekend: The most typical utilization rate reported in the focus group was 60%. Some drivers reported that their utilization rate was higher on weekends than weekdays while others stated that although the occupancy rate was the same on both weekend and weekdays, the riders' characteristics were distinct. This is in line with the findings of Cramer and Krueger (2016) . Using data from five cities in the US, they concluded that the utilization rate of ride-sourcing platforms is higher than taxis due to the larger scale of ride-sourcing platforms, more efficient matching and pricing strategies and also flexible labour model.

This feature, which is the so-called two-way (bilateral) rating system or reputation system, can intensify the interaction between drivers and riders and may enhance trust-building between them, particularly since they usually do not know each other. On the other hand, the platform can use the reputation system to control drivers/riders and monitor their behaviour given that the working relationship between the platform and digital workers is characterized by mistrust (Wentrup et al., 2019) . A beginning driver/rider starts with five stars and then the rating is adjusted according to the feedback, so the overall rating is an average of accumulated individual ratings. The reputational feedback mechanism can potentially influence the behaviour of both riders and drivers given the consequences of having a low rating, especially for drivers. a) Unfair rating system: Many drivers stated that they perceived the rating system to be unfair because of two key reasons: Firstly, the riders' rating is less reliable than drivers' rating since most of the riders do not travel as much as drivers, hence their ratings are based on fewer records. Secondly, the riders' rating is not considered as important as drivers' rating given that drivers are banned by Uber either temporarily or permanently if their rating is below what is considered by Uber as a minimum rating in that region while a low rating does not have any consequences for riders. In other words, riders play the role of middle managers over drivers given that their feedback is a key element for drivers (Rosenblat & Stark, 2015) , in a manner similar to other two-sided platforms such as Airbnb and TripAdvisor. Analysing the data from ride-sourcing platform in India, Kapoor and Tucker (2017) argued that drivers are stimulated to leave the platform by an unfair rating system.

            "text": "Once a request appears in the application, drivers are given a few seconds to decide whether to accept or decline (dismissing, not accepting) the request. Although the given information seems to be limited for making an informed decision, many requests are declined by drivers. Romanyuk (2016) argues that in a two-sided platform with a matching algorithm, the probability of rejecting a request by a seller is higher when the full information disclosure is available. Drivers are shown the pick-up point address, the distance and time between the driver's location and the pick-up point, and the rider's rating before accepting the requests which can lead to blind passenger acceptance when they do not have any information about the trip fare and the final destination. In case of accepting, the fastest route to the rider is given while the driver is still not able to find the final ride destination. The final destination is shown when the driver approaches the rider and pick him/her up. Some additive information is given as necessary, for example, if the request is within surge pricing, the trip is longer than 30 min, and the ride is pre-booked. a) Pick-up point location: In the focus group meetings, the drivers discussed their criteria for making decisions with regards to incoming requests. All the drivers unanimously believed that the requests with risky pick-up points located mostly in the city centre should be declined due to the high risk of getting fined by police while there is no support from neither the platform nor the rider. Getting fined leads to increasing the operational costs, therefore, less profit. b) Distance and time to the pick-up point: The distance and travel time between the driver's location and the pick-up point appear to be an influential factor. Given that drivers are not able to see the ride destination, a few drivers said they did not tend to accept the requests in which their pick-up points were located far from their current location. This is because there is a risk of ending up with a short-distance ride after driving to the faraway pick-up point. c) Rider's rating: Rider's rating is another factor that is always shown to drivers. In contrast to drivers who are not able to work for the platform when their rating is less than a certain threshold, riders can request rides regardless of their rating. Some drivers stated that they preferred not to accept the requests of the riders who have a low rating. The high risk of misbehaving as well as giving the driver a low rating was mentioned by some drivers as the main reason for declining those requests.",

Both riders and drivers are informed if the price of a request has surged that means higher income for drivers. That is why drivers try to enter those areas and receive promoted requests. Some drivers reported that they did not accept the requests with standard pricing when they were close or on the way of surge pricing areas. Many drivers said they are more likely to accept requests indicated by 30+ in the application, indicating that the ride takes more than 30 minutes. Long-distance rides which are complemented by surge pricing were appreciated by all drivers as the best rides.",

The plausible destination, for example, was mentioned by some drivers as one of the criteria. The most experienced drivers said that they predicted the final destination of the requests based on the rider origin and the request arrival time, so the requests which seemed to be short rides were declined. h) Cancellation criteria: The other choice made by drivers is to cancel a trip after accepting its request even though it is preferred not to cancel trips due to the possible consequences. Risky pick-up points, short-distance rides, and problematic riders were mentioned as the main reasons for the cancellations. Some inexperienced drivers stated that despite the fact that they are shown the pick-up address before accepting the request, they could not recognize if it has a risk of getting fined. That is why they accepted the ride, approached the address to assess the pick-up point. If they found it risky to stop, they cancelled the ride.",

Therefore, they drive around or drive somewhere until a request appears. This behaviour can increase the empty rides and cause some environmental issues due to the risk of increasing vehicle kilometres travelled.

Weather condition, as well as the operation of public transportation and flights, can also influence the drivers' decisions on their spatialtemporal coverage. Many drivers reported that demand is higher on rainy, snowy, and cold days and also in case of a disruption in public transport or flights. An underlying distinction can be drawn between part-time and full-time drivers in this case. As the part-time drivers were less flexible than full-time drivers due to other activities/commitments, they did not tend to change their schedule and service area because of the external factors. While many full-time drivers followed the weather condition and public transport operations through either Uber application or weather forecast/planner applications or their community in order to decide when and where to work. Moreover, events such as concerts and festivals can potentially impact the drivers' working schedule and area.

Notwithstanding, many drivers disliked the idea of shared rides and the associated matching and pricing mechanisms. Some drivers were familiar with the concept of pooled rides through another ride-sourcing company, namely \"ViaVan\" which exclusively provides on-demand shared transit services in Amsterdam. a) Pricing: Based on the drivers' understanding of the ViaVan pricing strategy, drivers are paid based on the kilometres travelled, regardless of the number of passengers. Therefore, additional passengers do not necessarily lead to higher earning. Most drivers said shared rides would be appealing if passengers would have paid separately. One driver said extra pick-up travel time and embarking fee should be considered in the trip fare for each passenger.",

Despite the fact that the riders requesting shared ride are aware of some possible delays and deviations, there is still, for example, a chance of conflict between riders especially when a rider is in rush and the driver needs to pick up another passenger who has requested a ride, but he/she is not at the pick-up point. A few drivers believed the rider who is in a hurry may put some pressure on the driver which could be stressful for the driver and affect the driver's rating given by the riders.",

Moreover, working shift and ride acceptance might be linked by the served demand so that drivers assess the shift profitability based on the earned income which is dependent on the characteristics of the accepted rides during the selected working schedule.

As such, drivers are in the heart of the ride-sourcing system, yet very limited research attention has been devoted to understanding their motives and perceptions. This is of particular relevance given the existing tension between drivers and the platforms in several countries where these companies operate.

Estimating choice models for explaining driver's decisions (e.g. joining the platform, working shift, rebalancing, ride acceptance) will facilitate the assessment of the impacts of different policies and system conditions on supply-side dynamics and system performance. This study was conducted in the Netherlands where there is a single ride-sourcing platform (Uber) that dominates the market. An important research direction would be to replicate such a study in a more competitive environment in which several ride-sourcing companies are trying to attract both users and drivers. It should be noted that the data collection was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further insight is required to understand the possible changes to drivers' behaviour due to the new demand patterns, changes in users' travel behaviour, and public health risks. It is also recommended to look at this system through the lens of other stakeholders including platform providers, policymakers, and users to explore their attitudes, preferences, concerns, and limitations. Then, a comprehensive conceptual model may be developed to explain the dynamics between all the agents.

Therefore, given that the utilization rate fluctuates during the year, they did not feel that the job was financially secure.\"During the summertime, there are so many tourists. And there's so much going on. But the period after Christmas\u2026 There's such a decline in income for those months\u2026 you almost can't compensate for it in the busier months.\" D1P3 \"It's not always secure. In the winter it can be that you will leave really early and don't drive a lot, and if you get a fine or get an accident... That can happen. You will have a lot of costs and no income.\" D4P2 c) Ride-sourcing versus taxi: Despite the unstable utilization rate, one of the drivers who was working for normal taxi companies confirmed that the utilization rate of Uber is much higher than normal taxis. \"In a normal taxi, I'm empty way more. If I drive for Uber, I can have up to three customers per hour.\" D4F1",

Yeah, you make one mistake and everyone's day is ruined. Take the wrong exit and someone is late and the other as well. It will only get worse\u2026\" D5P3 3.3.3. Income a) Low income: Most drivers complained about their low income due to the platform's high commission fee (25% of each trip) and strong competition between drivers. They suggested that the commission fee should be lowered and the competition between drivers needs to be controlled by imposing a constraint on the maximum number of active drivers in the region.\"I [as Uber CEO] would set a maximum of drivers in all big cities. So, a max in Amsterdam and Utrecht. There shouldn't be too many drivers.\" D2P1",

If you pick someone up there, you don't have to pay the 25 percent.\" D2F3 b) Guaranteed hourly income: Another driver argued that since he could not trust Uber to give him a bonus for 10 rides, he preferred to have a guaranteed hourly income to offer a service in low-demand areas. This comment can also stress the necessity of dealing with the persistent strong mistrust. \"If they want me to go to Lemsterhoek [a low demand area in Rotterdam], I just want a guaranteed hourly rate. Not 10 rides. Then, I do only 9 and the system might reject me after that. I don't trust that.\" D3P3",
