We propose a method that incorporates simple semantics into TDT by splitting the term space into groups of terms that have the meaning of the same type. Such a group can be associated with an external ontology. This ontology is used to determine the similarity of two terms in the given group. We extract proper names, locations, temporal expressions and normal terms into distinct sub-vectors of the document representation. Measuring the similarity of two documents is conducted by comparing a pair of their corresponding sub-vectors at a time. We use a simple perceptron to optimize the relative emphasis of each semantic class in the tracking and detection decisions. The results suggest that the spatial and the temporal similarity measures need to be improved.

The detection and tracking algorithms have to take these into account and make sure, they do not miss anything relevant.

The methods applied in TDT cover a good portion of the prevailing techniques information extraction, retrieval and filtering, text clustering and text categorization and natural language processing. Fundamentally, a TDT system runs on-line and does not have any knowledge of the unseen documents, which makes it a case for clustering. There has been, however, research on retrospective topic detection and tracking, where the system is shown all of the data at once (Allan et al. 1998a ), but the focus is mainly on the on-line setting. Allan et al. (1998c) considered each incoming document a query that was made on the previous documents. If the returned answer was not similar enough, the story was considered a first-story. The terms were weighted with a modification of TFIDF and by its surprisingness. A term was seen as surprising if it had not occurred recently. The need for exhaustive pair-wise comparisons of documents was avoided by the use of an inverted index. Motivated by this computational efficiency, we employ the inverted index as well. employed a group-average and a single-pass clustering in topic detection. Typically, the group-average clustering (GAC) iterates over the data, starting from one-document singletons and at each step merging the closest clusters until given number of clusters is found or the clusters are too distant to be merged. The computational complexity of GAC is typically quadratic to the number of documents. The efficiency was increased by dividing the clusters into evenly-sized buckets (Cutting et al. 1992 ) and applying GAC locally to a bucket before removing bucket boundaries. The single-pass approach constructs clusters in one go. A document is associated with an event, if the similarity exceeds a pre-set threshold. This approach was accompanied by a time penalty: events tend to be temporally proximate and thus older documents are less likely to discuss the same event.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 556, "end": 575, "text": "(Allan et al. 1998a", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 627, "end": 647, "text": "Allan et al.
