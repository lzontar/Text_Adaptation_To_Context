While the global source sink dynamics of the different seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, it's local spread remains less clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective reproduction number changed over the course of the season. We find trends in transmission dynamics correlated positively with trends in temperature, but not relative humidity nor school holidays. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the April 26, 2020 1/23 elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network, while school children likely drove the spread within the remaining transmission network. These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other influenza seasons and cities.",

While it can be hugely important to understand how diseases spread around the globe, local spread is most often the main driver of novel infections of respiratory diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We here use genetic sequence data alongside patient information to better understand what the drives the local spread of influenza by looking at the 2016/2017 influenza season in Basel, Switzerland as an example. The genetic sequence data allows us to reconstruct the how the transmission dynamics changed over the course of the season, which we correlate to changes, but not humidity or school holidays. Additionally, the genetic sequence data allows us to see how individual cases are connected. Using patient information, such as age and household status our analyses suggest that the elderly mainly transmit within their own transmission network. Additionally, they suggest that school aged children, but not pre-school aged children are important drivers of the local spread of influenza.",

Through 4 rapid evolution, influenza strains evade host immunity, allowing them to reinfect large 5 fractions of a population every year. In order to prevent infections, limited public health 6 resources have to be streamlined as efficiently as possible [1] . The planning of 7 interventions is dependent upon knowledge of the dynamics of epidemic spread of 8 influenza viruses in a city environment, which includes understanding the drivers of the 9 spread of seasonal influenza between individuals. Incidence and prevalence data can be 10 used to some extent to infer such dynamics. However, they lack the information about 11 how individual cases are epidemiologically related. cities constitute highly heterogeneous societies with various different living 29 arrangements and vastly different social and age groups. This means that lessons learnt 30 about influenza transmission from college campuses are not necessarily transferable to 31 cities. Children have, for example, been described to make up a larger portion of the 32 infected population at the beginning of a season compared to the end over 3 seasons in 33 Houston [14] . 34 In an effort to fill that gap, we studied the local spread of influenza and the factors 35 contributing to it in the city of Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 Influenza 36 season which was dominated by Influenza A/H3N2. To do so, influenza samples 37 together with the age and residential address were collected from around 669 patients 38 from the University Hospital (USB), the Children's Hospital of Basel (UKBB) and 39 patients of private practices from around the city. Around 200 of these patients also 40 provided additional information through filling out a survey. The survey asked 41 questions about family status, financial status, and demographics. Details on the data 42 collection is provided in [15] . We assess here the importance of introductions of 43 influenza into a city for seeding a seasonal epidemic, the overall dynamics of 44 transmission throughout the season, and the extent to which different age groups and 45 family statuses drive the spread of seasonal influenza in a city. 46 Methods and Material 47 Data collection and sequencing 48 We collected all data in the 2016/17 influenza season as described in [15] . Sequencing 49 was performed as described in [16] . Raw Illumina reads were trimmed with 50 Trimmomatic 0.36 [17] . Alignment of paired-end reads was done by using bowtie 51 2.2.3 [18] , using strain A/New York/18/2014 as a reference. The aligned reads were 52 sorted by using samtools 1.2 [19] . Variants were called and filtered by using lofreq 53 2.1.2 [20] . Variant calling was done for sites with a coverage of at least 100. Sites with a 54 coverage of less than 100 were assumed to be unknown and were denoted as N, that is 55 any possible nucleotide (Details on the exclusion of sequences are described in the 56 supplement). Exact input specification can be found at 57 https://github.com/nicfel/FluBaselPhylo/tree/master/Sequences. The consensus 58 sequences from this study were deposited in GenBank (numbers MN299375-MN304713). 59",

These 83 sequences were downloaded from fludb.org, were not used otherwise and are an 84 independent dataset. We allowed each segment to have its own phylogeny in order to 85 avoid reassortment to bias the estimates of evolutionary rates. Each of the segments, as 86 well as the first two and third codon position was allowed to have its own rate scaler. 87 We ran 10 independent MCMC chains each for 10 8 iterations and then combined them 88 after a burn-in of 10%. These estimated evolutionary rates are long-term rates of 89 influenza A/H3N2. Since the effects of selection over short time periods are smaller 90 compared to longer time periods. The evolutionary rates can be expected to be faster 91 for shorter time windows [26] . We therefore expect the pairwise distances estimated for 92 our data from the 2016/17 outbreak using these rates to be an overestimate of the 93 actual divergence times. The xml and log files for the analysis can be found here 94 https://github.com/nicfel/FluBaselPhylo/tree/master/EvolutionaryRates. 95 We next reconstructed the phylogenetic trees of all initial clusters by using the full 96 genomes of all samples in the initial clusters. We fixed the evolutionary rates to be 97 equal to the mean evolutionary rates as estimated previously, with the mean 98 evolutionary rate being 2.9 * 10 \u2212 3 per site and year. As a population prior, we used a 99 constant coalescent model with an effective population size being shared among all 100 initial clusters. We then estimated a distribution of phylogenies for each initial cluster, 101 assuming that all segments share the same phylogeny. If reassortment happened, it 102 would increase the distance between samples. Due to using fixed evolutionary rates as 103 estimated in the previous analysis, reassortment will not bias evolutionary rates. Hence, 104 reassortment events will increase the pairwise distance between isolates separated by 105 reassortment, but will not bias the distance between isolates that are not.",

To reflect our prior belief that Basel is unlikely to act as 111 a relevant source of influenza on a global scale, we classified internal nodes that are not 112 exclusively classified to be in Basel as not in Basel. Since the flu season is only a few 113 months long, we additionally assumed that lineages are unlikely to persist in Basel for 114 more than 0.1 years without being sampled. To reflect that assumption, we classified 115 internal nodes that are more than 0.1 years from a sample from Basel to be either in a 116 location other than Basel, or to be in an unknown location. We then defined sequences 117 to be in the same local cluster if all their ancestors are inferred to be in Basel. We get 118 these local clusters for each iteration of the MCMC.

A Probability that an individual from the group in each row is connected to an individual from the group in a column. These probabilities were calculated by using the inverse number of samples from each group as weights. Upper and lower bounds correspond to 95% confidence intervals around the estimated probability. B The color of each tile in the heatmap corresponds to the p-value for either positive (red) or negative (blue) associations. These p-values are bonferroni corrected for the number of comparisons (42). We estimate these p-values by randomly permuting the group to patient labels and then comparing the number of pairs of interactions we observe in the data vs. when randomly permuting. For both approaches, we find that mostly school-aged children are associated with 339 other school-aged children, and the elderly are associated with other elderly people. We 340 additionally find higher association between children of any age and adults living in the 341 same household as children than children of any age and adults without children (see 342 figure 3 ). Adults living in the same household as children, on the other hand, are 343 estimated to have low association to other adults without children and much higher 344 association to children, whereas adults without children are mostly associated to other 345 adults without children (see figure 3a) .",

Additionally, we connected the genetic 376 information to patient information such a residential address and age for all and more 377 personal information for a lot of the patients, providing unparalleled resolution to study 378 how influenza spreads locally. The 2016/17 season for which we collected data was 379 dominated by influenza A/H3N2. Based on this data, we observe that hundreds of 380 introductions initiate the seasonal influenza epidemic in the studied city of Basel, that 381 the overall spread varies throughout the season, and that children seem to drive the 382 local outbreaks, while elderly have their own transmission chains. Overall, the dataset included sequencing runs from 842 unique isolates. For some of 398 these isolated, sequencing was performed more than once.
