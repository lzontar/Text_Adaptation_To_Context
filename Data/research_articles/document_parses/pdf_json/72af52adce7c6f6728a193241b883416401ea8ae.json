Our SEIRD type model features asymptomatic and symptomatic infections with detailed hospital dynamics. We model explicitly branching probabilities and non-exponential residence times in each latent and infected compartments. Using both hospital admittance confirmed cases and deaths, we infer the contact rate and the initial conditions of the dynamical system, considering breakpoints to model lockdown interventions and the increase in effective population size due to lockdown relaxation. The latter features let us model lockdown-induced 2nd waves. Our Bayesian approach allows us to produce timely probabilistic forecasts of hospital demand. We have applied the model to analyze more than 70 metropolitan areas and 32 states in Mexico. 13 burden on the economy, affecting more individuals living in low-income conditions, 14 challenging the population's capacity to comply with control measures. As lockdown 15 measures are eased, more people become in contact with the outbreak, and there is a 16 risk of induced 2nd waves that may increase healthcare system pressure. 17 Broadly speaking, data-driven epidemiological models are built out of the necessity 18 of making forecasts. There are many lessons learned on emergency preparedness and 19 epidemic surveillance from previous pandemic events: AH1N1 influenza [8], MERS [9], : medRxiv preprint 102 full compartmental SEIRD model featuring several compartments to describe hospital 103 dynamics (see Figure 1 and supporting materials, SM) with sub-compartments to model 104 explicitly residence rates as Erlang distributions [14, 15] . The model has two variants, 105 one with age structure and one that assumes age-independent dynamics. Here we 106 describe the latter (see supporting material for some additional comments on the 107 age-dependent model).",

            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has posed a major challenge to public health systems 2 in many countries with the imminent risk of saturated hospitals and patients not 3 receiving proper medical care. Although the scientific community and public health 4 authorities had insight regarding the risks and preparedness measures required at the 5 onset of a zoonotic pandemic, our knowledge of the fatality and spread rates of 6 COVID-19 remains limited [1] [2] [3] [4] . In terms of disease handling, two leading issues 7 determining the current situation are the lack of pharmaceutical treatment and our 8 inability to estimate the extent of the asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 [5] [6] [7] . 9 Under current circumstances, control measures reduce new infections by limiting the 10 number of contacts through mitigation and suppression [1] . Mitigation includes social 11 distancing, testing, tracing, and isolating infected individuals, while suppression imposes 12 temporary cancellation of non-essential activities. Mitigation and suppression pose a SARS [10] , Zika [11] , Ebola [12] , etcetera. However, surveillance data during a pandemic 21 event often suffer from serious deficiencies such as incompleteness and backlogs. 22 Another critical issue is the design of data acquisition, taking into account geographical 23 granularity [13] . Epidemic surveillance of COVID-19 is no different since there is an 24 unknown percentage of asymptomatic infections, and susceptibility is related to 25 economic vulnerability. 26 Undoubtedly, one key task during the early pandemic response efforts is using 27 epidemiological records and mathematical and statistical modeling to forecast excess 28 hospital care demand with formal quantified uncertainty. 29 In this paper, we pose a compartmental SEIRD model that considers both 30 asymptomatic and symptomatic infection, including hospital dynamics. We model the 31 residence time in each latent and infected compartments explicitly [14, 15] , and we use 32 records of daily confirmed cases and deaths to pose a statistical model that accounts for 33 data overdispersion [16, 17] . Furthermore, we use Bayesian inference to estimate the 34 initial state of the governing equations, the contact rate, and a proxy of the population 35 size to make probabilistic forecasts of the required hospital beds, including the number 36 of intensive care units. The model output has been used by Mexican public health 37 authorities to assist decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic in more than 70 38 metropolitan areas and the country's 32 states. 39 Contributions and limitations 40 \u2022 We developed a model to produce accurate midterm (several weeks) probabilistic 41 forecasting of COVID-19 hospital pressure, namely hospital beds and respiratory 42 support or mechanical ventilation demands, using confirmed records of cases at 43 hospital admittance and deaths. 44 \u2022 Our model accounts for policy changes in control measures, such as school 45 closures [18] and lockdowns, as breakpoints in the transmission rates. 46 \u2022 Assuming a given fraction of asymptomatic individuals, we infer changes in the 47 transmission rate and the effective population size before and after a given 48 lockdown-relaxation day. 49 \u2022 Inferred changes in effective population size allows us to produce a forecast of 50 lockdown-induced 2nd waves. 51 Since asymptomatic infection is not fully understood so far [19] , the fraction of 52 asymptomatic individuals is yet unknown.

Letting 208 S(0) = N \u2212 (E(0) + I A (0) + I S (0)) and setting the rest of the parameters to zero, we 209 have all initial conditions defined and the model may be solved numerically to obtain 210 \u00b5 D and \u00b5 c to evaluate our likelihood. 211 Finally, regarding the elicitation of the parameters prior distribution, we use Gamma 212 distributions with scale 1 and shape parameter 10 to model the initial conditions 213 E(0), I A (0), I S (0) of the community transmission. Following the argumentation of Cori 214 et al. [39] , we assume that local transmission starts when there are 10 confirmed cases. 215 The rationale for using Gamma distribution priors is that we can specify the 216 distribution by prescribing its first two moments, and the resulting distribution verifies 217 a maximum entropy condition. Namely, we obtain the less informative distribution that 218 has the prescribed mean and (log) variance [41] . The prior for the first transmission 219 rate \u03b2 0 , is a long tail, log Normal with \u03c3 2 = 1 and scale parameter 1; that is 220 log(\u03b2 0 ) \u223c N (0, 1). For the subsequent \u03b2's, we use autoregressive priors to impose some 221 coherence from one change point to the next with log(\u03b2 i ) \u223c N (log(\u03b2 i\u22121 ), 1). The prior 222 on \u03c9 i is a Beta(1 + 1/6, 1 + 1/3) restricted to \u03c9 i > \u03c9 i\u22121 . This beta distribution is a 223 fairly flat near uniform density in [0, 1], touches zero in 0 and 1, and is slightly skewed 224 to lower values. We model here the unlikely values \u03c9 i = 0, 1 and that under current 225 social distancing measures we expect smaller rather than larger N ef f . Otherwise, the 226 prior for the \u03c9 i 's is rather diffuse and non-informative.",

Two relaxation days, marked with red vertical lines, were judiciously included at local minimums, allowing for a minimum gap of 3 weeks. transmission rates are used as a proxy of behavioral changes, changes in the 282 connectivity between population clusters and super spreading events. 283 We in-line monitor exogenous changes in SEIRD parameters to inform the model of 284 interventions and relaxation days, in the same spirit of our inferences in the 285 transmission rate and initial conditions. Our analysis showed that we account for the 286 outbreak evolution in many metropolitan areas by setting one lockdown on 22 May 287 2020, the beginning of country-wide lockdown, and two more relaxation days. One 288 around 10 May, mother's day, a popular celebration in Mexican culture where families 289 gather together. The other relaxation day is set around four to eight days after 1 June, 290 the announced date for the country-wide lockdown relaxation measures. In some cases, 291 we also impose somewhat different relaxation days to account for local changes, such as 292 the opening of tourist activity. Of note, all relaxation days where set exclusive by our 293 R t based methodology. The interpretation, as above, came afterward. In a prior version of this ama model -before reaching the first acme-we did not infer 295 the effective population size, namely \u03c9. Instead, by modeling several countries that 296 already had passed the acme, we postulated \u03c9 = 1 and f = 0.05. This yields some 297 controversy that even reached the news media [43] .

To make the intrinsic generation-interval of the renewal equation in each compartment 374 more realistic we divide each compartment of the model into m equal sub-compartments 375 to generate an Erlang-distributed waiting time [14] . The Erlang distributions of each 376 compartment is calibrated by two parameters: the rate \u03bb E and the shape m, a positive 377 integer that corresponds to the number of sub-compartments on the model. In terms of 378 these parameters the mean of the Erlang distribution is m/\u03bb E , this mean correspond to 379 the average times in the dynamic model. 380 We use recent publications and information generously shared by the Instituto In our methodology, we aim to infer the force of the infection \u03bb. This parameter is 387 defined in terms of contact rate of asymptomatic/mild-symptomatic individuals \u03b2 A and 388 contact rate of symptomatic individuals \u03b2 S . Due to the functional dependence of \u03bb in 389 these parameters, there is a lack of identifiability between \u03b2 A and \u03b2 S that can not be 390 resolved without further assumptions. We assume that the relative strength between the 391 transmission rate of asymptomatic/mild-symptomatic and symptomatic is modeled as a 392 fixed ratio \u03ba. We model the value of \u03ba directly as the ratio of the viral load of 393 symptomatic and asymptomatic/mild-symptomatic patients [48, 49] Poisson distribution may be needed to correctly, and safely, model these types of data. 401 Following [16] (see main paper) the NB distribution is re parametrized in terms of its To sample from the posterior we resort to MCMC using the \"t-walk\" generic 434 sampler [42] . The MCMC runs semi-automatic, with a fairly consistent burn-in of 1,000 435 iterations (sampling initial values from the prior). We perform subsampling using the Adding group ages is straightforward in these types of models. The number a of age 450 groups is decided, and our model is repeated a times. Different residence times may be 451 included [50] but we preferred to concentrate on the different transition probabilities 452 g, h that vary nearly two orders of magnitude using age groups 453 [0, 25], (25, 50] , (50, 65] , (65, 100] [1] . The age structure is used to divide the initial 454 infectious and susceptible population proportional to each age group size. We infer the 455 same number of parameters, using a single \u03b2, with an optional weighting contact 456 matrix [51] to model different contact rates among age groups in specific regions. Using 457 a sufficiently flexible software design, progressing to an age-structure model is not 458 complex; nonetheless, the MCMC may run substantially slower. We have experimented 459 with our age-structured model using census data from Mexico and both uniform and 460 non-uniform contact matrices. However, we do not report any of these results here, 461 given that our non-age structure model has sufficiently enough predictive power, as 462 already discussed. To explain the confounding effect of N ef f \u00d7 f we have two observations. First, if we let f =f /\u03b1 for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0,f ) then differential equations for the variables I c , H 1 , H 2 , H 3 , U 1 , U 2 and D remain invariant and the equations for I s becomes dI S dt =f \u03b1 \u03c3 1 E \u2212 \u03c3 2 I S .",

For data y i we let y i \u223c N B(p\u00b5(t i ), \u03c9, \u03b8), 405 with fixed values for the overdispersion parameters \u03c9 N B , \u03b8 and an additional reporting 406 probability p. The index of dispersion is \u03c3 2 /\u00b5 = \u03c9 N B + \u03b8\u00b5. Over dispersion with 407 respect to the Poisson distribution is achieved when \u03c9 N B > 1 and the index of 408 dispersion increases with size if \u03b8 = 0; both desirable characteristics in outbreak data, 409 adding variability as counts increase. In both cases we found good performance fixing 410 \u03c9 N B = 2. To model daily deaths, we fixed \u03b8 = 0.5 and for daily cases \u03b8 = 1 implying 411 higher variability for the later. The reporting probabilities are 0.95 for deaths and 0.85 412 for cases, with the assumption that the c i 's are confirmed sufficiently severe cases 413 arriving at hospitals. As explained in the main paper, the theoretical expectations 414 estimated in terms of the dynamical model are given by \u00b5 D (t i ) and \u00b5 c (t i ) for dead and 415 cases, respectively. 416 S4 Modeling interventions and Bayesian Inference 417 We assume conditional independence in the data, and therefore from the NB model, we 418 obtain a likelihood. Our parameters are the contact rate parameters \u03b2's, the \u03c9's and 419 crucially we also infer the initial conditions E(0), I A (0), I S (0). Letting 420 S(0) = N \u2212 (E(0) + I A (0) + I S (0)) and setting the rest of the parameters to zero, we 421 have all initial conditions defined and the model may be solved numerically to obtain 422 \u00b5 D and \u00b5 c to evaluate our likelihood. We use the lsoda solver available in the 423 scipy.integrate.odeint Python function. 424 Moreover, as explained in the main paper, we also estimate \u03c9 i with N ef f = \u03c9 i N , 425 both before and after a change point (\"relaxation day\"; we show intervention days with 426 black vertical lines and relaxation change points with red vertical lines in our plots, see 427 next section). To make it a bit simple, we also force the model to have a new \u03b2 428 parameter after a relaxation day. However, the process of numerically solving the 429 system of ODE's is slightly more complex. For a set of parameter values, including the , 430 to evaluate the likelihood, one needs to apply the solver from time t = 0 to the first 431 relaxation day, considering N ef f = \u03c9 1 N . Then for \u03c9 2 > \u03c9 1 we use the last values of all 432 state variables as initial values for a second solve now with N ef f = \u03c9 2 N , and so forth. 433",
