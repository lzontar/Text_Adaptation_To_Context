Under this urgent circumstance, many detection methods have been developed to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [10] . COVID-19 virus detection is performed using samples such as swabs, nasal swabs, nasopharynx or trachea extracts, sputum or lung tissue, blood and feces from suspected patients [3] . The most applied method of laboratory diagnosis is the nucleic acid detection through reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction [4] . Meanwhile, the specific high sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking technology, developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MA, USA experts, offers rapid investigation of the virus using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments, reducing the diagnosis time [7] . Through SARS-CoV-2 identification, the virus is differentiated from other diseases, for instance, influenza, bacterial pneumonia, adenovirus, rhinovirus and other noninfectious illness [3] . Importantly, the reduction of recognition time seems to be essential, since the rapid spread of COVID-19 [11] .",

In the beginning of the global outbreak, the WHO announced that a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 might be at hand in 18 months, however as the structure of virus has been revealed, rapid strategies targeting the spike glycoprotein have been optimized [1] and many are under clinical trials. To date, the adopted treatment is the application of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Among the tested antiviral drugs used is interferon, which has shown to be effective against CoVs [10, 11] and has been recommended by The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China in addition to lopinavir and ritonavir protease inhibitors [12] . Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, was used to treat SARS-CoV in Hong Kong, representing another option [4] combined with protease inhibitors [12] . The National Medical Products Administration of China approved favilavir for marketing at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak [10] . Another drug under test is Arbidol, which reduces the reproduction of SARS in vitro [7] . Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue developed for Ebola virus, was reported as a potential treatment for COVID-19, since it demonstrated the blocking of SARS-CoV-2 replication when combined with interferon or chloroquine, as well as alone [2] . Other antiviral drugs under test are nafamostat, nitazoxanide, penciclovir, oseltamivir and baricitinib [2, 12] . The number of registered clinical trials using antiviral drugs for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 is 195, up to 3 June 2020.",

Soft nanomaterials obtained from polymers (polymeric nanoparticles), lipids (lipid-solid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, liposomes), surfactants (microemulsion, nanoemulsions, liquid crystals) and proteins (protein nanoparticles) have been applied in nanomedicine, especially for drug delivery. The magnitude of interactions between nanomaterials and tissues/biological molecules is the base for their use for various medical applications [16] . Drug-based nanoparticles have been developed for decades, and several are under clinical trials for cancer, neurodegenerative, inflammatory, cardiovascular and infectious diseases, although only few of them are approved for human use [13] . The improvement of biopharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of drug loading is the main tool of soft nanomaterials. Also, nanoparticles can promote specific drug targeting (passive or active targeting) and controlled drug-release rate, thereby, affecting the efficacy and safety of the treatment. Besides soft and metal nanoparticles have been applied in nanomedicine, mainly due to their various antimicrobial activities (antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic and antiviral) [13] .",

            "text": "Due to the emergence of pathogenic bacteria resistant to antimicrobials, several studies have reported the efficacy of the nanotechnology-based antimicrobial therapy. Similarly, the occurrence of new viruses and their heterogeneity has also demanded innovative therapies. This way, considering specific targeting, nanotechnology opens a new avenue for antiviral therapy. The strategy of using nanoparticles to combat SARS-CoV-2 could involve mechanisms that effect the entry of the virus into the host cell until their inactivation. The blockage of the viral surface proteins may lead to virus inactivation, so targeted nanoparticles, specific to virus expressed proteins could reduce the viral internalization [17] . Metal nanoparticles have shown the ability to block viral attachment to the cell surface, leading to the inhibition of viral internalization and thereby impairing the viral replication during viral entry. Nanoparticles composed of titanium (Ti), silver (Ag), gold (Au) and zinc (Zn) have already shown results against the HIV, influenza virus, herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, monkey pox virus and zika virus [13] . The mechanism of action is based on the nanoparticles binding onto the viral envelope or its protein, impairing the interaction with the host cell. The efficacy of the treatment is related to the size, shape and the surface charge of the nanoparticles, however, safety measures must be taken regarding the concentration to avoid cytotoxicity of host cells [18] . Organic nanoparticles have been used for delivering antivirals such as zidovudine, acyclovir, dapivirine and efavirenz, with the aim to improve drug bioavailability and promote efficient drug delivery and targeted antiviral activity [19] . The main limitations of antivirals are the lack of specific targeting, resulting in cytotoxicity of the host cell, which can be addressed by organic nanoparticles. The versatility of nanoparticles makes them tunable vectors for virus targeting and specific drug delivery. Antimicrobial drugs have been tested in clinical trials for COVID-19, such as chloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, ribavirim and remdesivir, and have demonstrated promising results against SARS-CoV-2 [4] . Nanoencapsulation of antimicrobial drugs may contribute to the development of safer treatments for COVID-19 and other viral diseases.",
