They are rather should be considered a variation of a normal physiologic process. The aim of this study is to examine the correlation between the functional cyst and the menarche age. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed charts of 50 Medicine girls University of Alexandroupolis and 6 teenagers from Hospital Kastoria, years old with non inflammatory benign ovarian masses from January 1999 to December 2006. Operations were performed because of pain or ultrasound suspected features. The patients who were not operated were kept under observation and had ultrasound tests monthly, receiving orale contraceptive to facilitate resolution of the cyst. We evaluated the current age at menarche and functional ovarian cysts among Medicine girls. Results: The ovarian cysts were unilateral and simple, with the size varying between 3 and 5 cm in 45 cases and more than 5 cm in 11 cases. In 4 cases were found size less than 3 cm. Ovarian cysts with size more than 4 cm were in 75% with late menarche ([14 years) and in 70% of them associated with menstrual cycle abnormalities. Among 56 young women 5 (8.9%) were initially qualified for the operation. The main indication for surgery was the presence of the ovarian mass. The diagnoses of the presence of ovarian mass were the follows: acute abdominal pain and recurrent abdominal pain despite conservative treatment, abdominal distension, menstrual bleeding. Hormonal treatment was given in 39 cases, whereas in 8 cases only follow up sonography was performed. Conclusions: In this study population there is a correlation between late menarche and increased size of functional ovarian cysts.

In this report we analysed cases from a Greek population for: Preoperative and Intraoperative tumor evaluation, operative treatment, staging, follow-up and pregnancy rate. Materials and methods: The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the frequency, clinical aspects and surgical management of ovarian masses in fifty-two adolescent patients, in whom surgery was deemed necessary, between the years 1991-2006 We considered age, symptoms, ultrasound investigations, CA 125 levels, family history, operative treatment, surgical complications tumour size, histopathological examinations, pregnancy rate and follow up. Results: Ovarian lesions in teenagers include a broad array of pathologic diagnoses that have variable and non-specific presenting symptoms. The majority of operated women 39 (75.5%) were under 17 years of age. The mean age was 16.635 \u00b1 5 SD years (range min 14-max 19 years). The most common presenting complaint was abdominal pain in 34 (65.4%). Forty seven patients (90.4%) had benign lesions, two (3.8%) had borderline tumours and three patients had malignant lesions (5.8%). Most of the patients who wished to conceive subsequently did so.

We present the surgical reconstructive options. Materials and methods: Three adolescent girls, aged 15-18 years with primary amenorrhea, cyclic abdominal pain, echo-free pelvic mass and complete vaginal agenesis by normal external genitalia were operated in our clinic. A combinative vaginal and laparoscopic approach was followed to reconstruct a neovagina by human amniotic membranes, establish the uterovaginal continuity, restore free cervical passage and perform pelvic adhesiolysis. We evaluated the operative, anatomical and functional results over a 6-months-follow-up period. Results: Mean neovaginal length was 10 cm (range: 9-12 cm) and a width allowing the easy introduction of two fingers. In all patients the uterovaginal continuity could successfully be restored; in one patient a two-step surgical approach had to be followed to fully establish cervical passage. Satisfactory anatomical and functional results could be achieved, with no operative morbidity. Two girls had a uterus bicornis unicollis, but no metroplasty or hemihysterectomy had to be performed. Regular menstruation resumed with normal ultrasound findings in the follow-up. One patient engaged in sexual activities 2 months after surgery, while the other two continued intermittently using a vaginal dilator to prevent contraction of the neovagina. Conclusions: In rare cases of obstructed functioning uterus due to a complete vaginal agenesis, a combinative laparoscopic and vaginal surgical approach may effectively restore anatomy and function, by an overall minimal operative morbidity. Especially processed human amniotic membranes provide excellent results in neovaginal reconstruction.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Objective: Insulin resistance is characterized by inadequately high glucose levels in relation to the corresponding insulin concentrations. It is found in subjects with overweight and obesity and also in patients with PCOS. This study employed a standardized test meal for a more physiologic test situation than offered by the oral glucose tolerance test. Whether or not there are differences under everyday conditions between the basal and postprandial state in PCOS patients is as yet unknown. Materials and methods: 32 non-diabetic PCOS-women from the LIPCOS study and 64 BMI-and age-matched normocyclic controls were given a standardized test meal (260 kcal, 62% carb, 32% fat, 6% protein) for submaximal stimulation of insulin and glucose which were determined at baseline and at 60,120 and 180 min postprandially. Results: Basal and postprandial insulin levels were quite similar in PCOS-patients and controls (C). However, glucose levels at baseline were significantly elevated in PCOS-patients (92.8 \u00b1 1.7 (PCOS) vs. 84.7 \u00b1 1.2 mg/dl (C); p \\ 0.001). By contrast, postprandial glucose levels were no longer different. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that in the fasting state PCOS patients have greater insulin resistance than weight-and age-matched controls. Interestingly, insulin resistance is not different between PCOS and normocyclic women in the postprandial state, suggesting that mechanisms of action for insulin metabolism might differ between the fasting and postprandial state that remain to be elucidated.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Objective: Leydig cell tumors and hyperplasia of the ovary are usually benign neoplastic diseases.

Ultrasound revealed normal sized, right-sided slightly polycystic ovaries. Further, the patient was pharmacological treated for Morbus Osler, bronchial asthma, and hypertension. No association of hyperandrogenism with the patient's medication list was detected. Bilateral laparoscopic adnexectomy was performed and histopathological examination revealed bilateral Leydig cell hyperplasia. Hyperandrogenism with hirsutism and alopecia resolved completely after surgical treatment.

EGF might act as a paracrine intraovarian factor and hence impair the maturation of follicles in the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Materials and methods: 27 IVF patients were examined in the three groups: women without signs of PCOS with normal ovaries (n = 9), ovulatory women with the sonographic appeareance of polycystic ovaries (PCO) (n = 10) and anovulatory women with classical PCOS (n = 8). EGF concentrations were determined in serum and in the follicular fluid by ELISA. Results: The mean serum concentration of EGF is significantly higher compared to the follicular fluid (median 274.9 pg/ml vs. 1.9 pg/ml, p \\ 0.05). However, no differences were detected in the EGF serum levels of all the three groups. The EGF levels in the follicular fluid of women with polycystic ovaries (PCO and PCOS) is significantly higher compared to normal women (median 2.2 pg/ml vs. 2.0 pg/ml vs. 0.7 pg/ml, p = 0.031). The EGF concentrations in the follicular fluid did not differ between polycystic ovaries with or without classical signs of PCOS (p = 0.791). Conclusions: EGF concentrations in follicular fluids of polycystic ovaries were higher than in normal ovaries. EGF possibly contributed to the pathogenesis of PCOS by impairing the maturation of follicles through the inhibition of aromatase activity in human granulosa cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Objective: 5, 10-methylenetetradydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key enzyme of homocysteine metabolism. A C ? T mutation at S64 Objective: Dysmenorrhoea is associated with significantly reduced quality of life. In a clinical study a reduction of dysmenorrhoic symptoms was observed in women using oral contraceptives containing CMA. Our working hypothesis is that CMA exerts its Arch Gynecol Obstet (2010) 282 (Suppl 1):S63-S270 S65 compared to other synthetic progestins. The aim of our study is to investigate the impact of CMA on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the phospholipase A 2 inhibitor annexin-1 in human endometrial explants and a human endometrial stromal cell line. Materials and methods: Human endometrial explants and the immortalized Yale human endometrial stromal cell line (YHES, ATCC) were used as model. The explants were obtained by aspiration curettage using a Pipelle (Laboratoire C.C.D). RT-qPCR assays (Universal Probe Library, Roche) were used on a LightCycler 480 instrument to analyze COX-2-mRNA levels by treatment with interleukin-1b (IL-1b), CMA\u00b1IL-1b and dexamethasone\u00b1IL-1b (10 -6 M each) within 6 h of culture for endometrial explants, 5 h of culture for YHES. Results: COX-2-mRNA was down-regulated in endometrial explants after 4 and 6 h of culture. The effects were more distinctive in the proliferative phase than in the secretory phase. Analog effects were observated for the production of PGF 2a . However, there was a high interindividual variation in expression levels. Similar effects of CMA and dexamethasone were observed in YHES after 5 h of culture compared to IL-1b stimulated samples. No significant effects on annexin-1-mRNA levels were found. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that CMA exerts dexamethasonelike glucocorticoidal effects in human endometrium and interacts with the arachidonic acid cascade by reducing COX-2-mRNA expression. This mechanism of action may explain the beneficial effect of CMA in dysmenorrhoea.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Objective: Luteinizing hormone (LH) is a triggering signal molecule for ovulation and responsible for numerous mechanisms in the ovary. During the follicular phase, FSH induces granulosa cells (GCs) to produce and express more LH-receptors. Therefore GCs are adequate target cells for LH. The aim of our study was to determinate the effect of different doses of LH on estrogen and progesterone receptors in human GCs. Materials and methods: Human GCs were obtained from patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in-vitro-fertilization with or without ICSI. After seven days of cultivation 10, 100 or 1000 mU/ml LH was substituted. The expression of both estrogen (ER-alpha and ER-beta) and both progesterone (PR-A and PR-B) receptors were analysed on mRNA-level by RT-PCR (TaqMan-PCR) and on protein-level by immunocytochemistry. The mRNA-isolation was performed after 2 h of stimulation. For immunocytochemistry GCs were cultivated for another 48 h. Unstimulated controls were always included. Results: Addition of 100 mU/ml and 1000 mU/ml LH lead to a significant higher expression of ER-beta and PR-A on mRNA-level analysed by RT-PCR (TaqMan-PCR) and protein level analysed by immunocytochemistry. LH did not affect ER-alpha and PR-B expression significantly. Conclusions: LH is known to be essential for ovulation and stimulates progesterone production in the corpus luteum. Results of our study suggest that LH mediates ER-beta and PR-A expression in human GCs. Therefore ER-beta and PR-A seem to be involved in ovulation and maintenance of the corpus luteum.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Objective: Unlike institutions of other specialities, obstetric departments are not only considered by their medical standard.

The etiology of the hemorrhage was investigated and characteristics of the two major pathologies (abruption placenta and placenta previa) were compared to each other. Characteristics included in the analysis were maternal age, religion (Christians-Muslims), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, nicotine and alcohol abuse, previous cesarean section, induced abortions, parity, gestational age at hemorrhage, management of the hemorrhage (conservative-need for emergency cesarean section), need for transfusion. Statistical analysis was performed by use of the SPSS 10 statistical package. Results: Placenta previa was the most common pathology in the third trimester hemorrhage. Advanced maternal age, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, smoking, and need for transfusion were significantly higher in the group of abruption placenta. Muslims presented a high prevalence of abruption placenta (p \\ 0.01).History of previous cesarean section, induced abortions and conservative management of the hemorrhage were strongly correlated to placenta previa (p \\ 0.01).

Results: Compared to controls women with GDM were older (33 \u00b1 6 vs. 30 \u00b1 5 years, p \\ 0.001), presented with higher pregravid BMI (28 \u00b1 7 vs. 24 \u00b1 5 kg/m 2 , p \\ 0.001), had higher levels of HbA1c (5.5 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 5.1 \u00b1 0,2%, p \\ 0.001), insulin (18 \u00b1 15 vs. 9 \u00b1 4 mU/l), c-peptide (2.9 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 1.9 \u00b1 0,7) and HOMA-Index (3.1 vs. 1.5) (p \\ 0.001, for all parameters). Additionally, in patients with GDM the hsCRP was significantly elevated (5.0 vs. 2.9, p \\ 0.001) and systolic (120 \u00b1 14 vs. 112 \u00b1 11 mmHg; p \\ 0.001) and diastolic (74 \u00b1 11 vs. 69 \u00b1 9, p \\ 0.001) blood pressure were increased. There was no difference in blood lipids, LPa and uric acid between the groups. Conclusions: Besides impaired glucose tolerance patients with GDM display a range of cardiovascular risk factors (BMI, hsCRP, RR, insulin resistance). Thus the diagnosis of GDM during pregnancy reveals individuals at risk to develop cardiovascular diseases later in life. Therefore the responsibility of the attending gynecologist essentially comprises preventive care including counseling (life style) and possibly also medication (Metformin, Glitazone GLP-1-analoga or DPPIV-Inhibitors might be beneficial).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Objective: With an incidence of 3-7% in all pregnant women preeclampsia is still the leading cause of fetal and maternal mortality. Clinical studies have documented a familiar tendency to develop preeclampsia. Additionally, patients with impaired endothelial health are at higher risk. Thus we studied genetic polymorphism of endothelial health related genes in women with and without preeclampsia. Materials and methods: 241 African and 279 Caucasian women were recruited in a two hospital-based case-control study for genetic testing of the polymorphisms Epoxide Hydrolase 1 (EPXH1) (codon 113, Tyr/His), Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (codon 298, Glu/ Asp), Angiotensinogen (codon 235, Met/Thr) and the Estrogen Receptor 1 polymorphism in intron 1 at position -401 T/C. Results: From the 241 African women, 95 developed preeclampsia including 19 evolving eclampsia. From the 279 Caucasian women 81 had preeclampsia including 28 developing a HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets)-syndrome. There was no difference in polymorphism distribution between cases and controls. However we could show statistically significant association of the EPHX polymorphism encoding Histidin with the severe courses of the disease. 85% His/His, 5% His/Tyr, 0% Tyr/Tyr in African women with eclampsia vs 67% His/His, 25% His/Tyr und 5% Tyr/Tyr in those with preeclampsia alone (p = 0.026) and 61% His/His, 36% His/Tyr, 3,6% Tyr/Tyr in Caucasian women developing a HELLPsyndrome vs 44% His/His, 40% His/Tyr und 17% Tyr/Tyr in preeclampsia alone (p = 0.045). Conclusions: EPXH plays an important role in both activation and detoxification of exogenous chemicals. The 113 Tyr/His exchange leads to decreased enzymatic activity interfering the capability of detoxification especially in endothelial cells which is believed to be part of the pathomechanism of preeclampsia.

We have shown previously that the MTHFR 677C [ T mutation strongly affects the ovarian response to recombinant FSH during controlled hyperstimulation. As this genetic variation is associated with increased plasma homocysteine (hcy) levels, we investigated whether hcy may influence the gene expression of CYP11, CYP19, and StAR which are important enzymes involved in the steroid metabolism of human granulosa cells (GC). Materials and methods: Immortalized HGL5 cells were cultured for a total of 5 days in M-199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0, 25, 100, or 200 lM D/L-hcy. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed to cDNA. Gene expression was determined by real-time PCR. The calculation of relative expression ratios was carried out with the Relative Expression Software Tool (REST) version 2008. Results: Exposure of HGL5 GC to hcy significantly enhanced the expression of CYP19 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation with 25 lM D/L-hcy increased CYP19 mRNA expression 4.29-fold (CI 95%: 2.05-10.99; p \\ 0.001), 100 lM D/L-hcy 8.04-fold (CI 95%: 1.76-43.85 ; p \\ 0.05) and 200 lM D/L-hcy 10.58-fold (CI 95%: 1.76-79.66 ; p \\ 0.0001).

It is hypothesized that disorders of the endometrium such as endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma are associated with a disorder of stem cell function. As a limiting factor of experimental studies to date only uteri from hysterectomies were used to assess stem cell activity. We conducted this study to characterize stem cells of the superficial layers of the stratum superficial, accessible by diagnostic endometrial biopsy in a routine clinical setting. We wanted to show that minimal invasive endometrial biopsies are an eligible tool to obtain multi-potent stem cells to enable studies in larger patient populations. Materials and methods: 36 patients underwent routine endometrial biopsy during diagnostics prior to infertility therapy. Endometrial stroma cells were isolated by immunodepletion and the expression of stem cell markers was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR and FACS analysis. Differentiation potential and cloning efficiency of serially passaged cell clones were studied in vitro. Results: Endometrial stroma cell clones derived from endometrial biopsies displayed characteristic properties of stem cells including clonality, long time cultivation, multipotent differentiation potential and expression of the stem cell markers CD 146, CD73, Msi-1, Notch-1 and Sox-2. Conclusions: Adult stem cells can be obtained from endometrial biopsies in a routine diagnostic setting.

A 24 h in-house consultant, attendance of a physician during second stage of labour, as well as a neonatal intensive care unit were also rated high. Most pregnant women preferred on ward lactation counselling. On the maternity ward, quality and variety of food and ambience were rated high. The respondents appreciated the opportunity to have the second routine examination of the neonate at the obstetric department. During puerperium, most women desired care by a midwife.

Obstetric units should give pregnant women the opportunity to get acquainted with the hospital and the staff ahead of birth. Objective: The preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) is defined as rupture of the amniotic membranes prior to 37 weeks of gestation. PPROM occurs in approximately 3% of all pregnancies and is responsible for a third of all preterm births. In 0.6-0.7% of all pregnancies PPROM occurs at or before 26 weeks of gestation and is associated with high perinatal morbidity and mortality. Previous preterm delivery, history of or current cervical incompetence, cerclage, history of PPROM and tobacco use could be identified as risk factors for PPROM at 14-24 weeks. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for PPROM prior to 28 weeks of gestation in pregnant women treated at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University Hospital Vienna. Materials and methods: This retrospective study included all patients (n = 56) with PPROM prior to 29 weeks of gestation during the years [2007] [2008] [2009] .

The battery of questions encompasses informational resources and decision making criteria helpful in choosing a birthing location. In this work, several parameters concerning satisfaction, as well as anticipation, of the women were evaluated. Results: Pregnant women and women in childbed are a very wellinformed and demanding audience. The most important resources are the internet, tours through the clinic and individual guidance by the gynaecologist or midwife. The most important determinants in the decision making process were identified by the respondents as: good reputation of the physicians and regional proximity of the clinic to the respondent's residence. Alternative methods of delivery were not named as items of interest. Individual counselling for breast feeding has a high priority and aids in identifying the most fitting clinic. Pregnant women highly value the 24-h presence of a doctor, modern and readily available equipment and the integration of a level 1 perinatal center in the clinic. Aspects of satisfaction and anticipation of the respondents were also ascertained in the questionnaire. The women expectations were predominantly either met or exceeded.

Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM, Ferinject \u00d2 ) is a new formulation for intravenous iron treatment making possible the application of a large amount of iron combined with a very low incidence of adverse reactions. Till now no data are available for the direct comparison of the previous used preparation Ferric-hydroxide-saccharate (FHS, Venofer \u00d2 ) and FCM. Materials and methods: In the pregnancy group a total of 52 women between 20 an 39 weeks of gestation were treated either with FCM (15 mg/kg bodyweight, max. 1000 mg i.v.) or FHS (2 9 200 mg i.v., in part repeatedly) 204 women in childbed were treated in the same period of time identically to the pregnancy group. Indication for treatment was a clinically relevant anemia. In both groups the increase in hemoglobin level, the ferritin level and the incidence of adverse reactions were recorded and compared. Results: The pregnancy groups were statistically comparable regarding gestational and maternal age, ferritin levels, pre-and posttherapeutic hemoglobin levels. 2 patients (8.3%) presented mild and transient adverse events after administration of FCM, 5 patients (17.9%) after FHS. Corresponding results for the postpartum group were found regarding the same parameters. 5 patients (4.9%) presented mild and transient adverse events after FCM-administration. 6 patients (5.9%) after FHS administration. Conclusions: Treatment with FCM is well tolerated. Both substances share a similar safety profile. FCM treatment mostly requires only a single administration; the risk for adverse events is decreased by 50% compared to treatment with FHS which requires at least two administrations cycles. FCM provides a better patient's comfort and a better cost-effectiveness. dilation. The Bishop score has proven to be suitable for predicting onset and progress of labor as well as successful labor induction followed by spontaneous vaginal delivery. However, its specificity in patients with low scores is unsatisfactory. Many studies have confirmed the value of sonographic measurement of cervical length for predicting imminent spontaneous delivery in preterm and term births.

Ultrasound showed macrocystic malformation of the left lung with polyhydramnios and marked mediastinal shift causing cardiac dextroposition and appearance of a hypoplastic right lung. No other associated anomalies were seen. Despite the suggested poor prognosis the patient decided to continue the pregnancy.

The patient presented an inappropriate abdominal growth for the gestational week with no clinical symptoms. A cystical tumor larger than 25 cm, which filled almost the whole abdomen, was diagnosed through ultrasound during a screening examination. With the suspicion of an ovarian process a laparotomy was then performed in a peripheric hospital. The uterus and the adnexa were without pathological findings and, because of the retroperitoneal location and the unclear origin of the tumor, the operation was terminated. After the patient was transferred to our clinic we performed a relaparotomy. Preoperative tumor markers and routine lab test were normal, the MRI described a 18 9 25 cm big multilocular mass, with clear delimitation and with unclear organ of origin, which compressed the V. cava inferior.

Pregnancy following RVT is associated with a variety of adverse pregnancy outcomes including second-trimester loss, preterm delivery and very rare improper attachment of the placenta. Closely monitoring a pregnancy after radical vaginal trachelectomy is a very important and often a challenging job to the responsible physician. This is a report of a 38 year old patient, who underwent radical vaginal trachelectomy at the age of 30. 8 years later the Patient underwent ovarial stimulation and became pregnant using an IVF protocol. First semester screening and second trimenon scan showed no abnormalities concerning the fetus. At 23 + 5 weeks the patient presented with severe vaginal bleeding and the placenta praevia was first diagnosed. The parametrical area was highly vasculated and beginning signs of infiltration of the placenta into the myometrium in terms of a placenta increta could not be ruled out. Due to repeated vaginal bleeding we administered betamethasone to accelerate fetal lung maturity. At time of the abstract we target a delivery between 28+ and 32+ weeks by caesarian section balancing the risk of premature delivery versus bleeding and abruption of the placenta. Objective: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like paroxetine are used to treat major depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder during the childbearing years. In late 2005 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended to avoid paroxetine in pregnancy because of an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations. Since that time there is an ongoing controversial debate about the safety of paroxetine during pregnancy. Materials and methods: In a prospective follow-up study we collected data of pregnancy outcomes after medication with paroxetine (n = 222) between 1990 and 2009. Our national Teratology Information Service (TIS) was contacted by physicians and patients after exposure to paroxetine in the first trimester. We compared the results with a control group (n = 733) of our TIS in the same interval, which was not or not severely exposed. Results: Both samples did not differ in gestational age at first contact (median: paroxetine group 50 days vs control group 51 days). After exposure to paroxetine 20 patients (20/222 = 9.0%) preferred termination of pregnancy. The incidence of elective terminations of pregnancy was much higher (p \\ 0.001) after medication with paroxetine than in the control group (19/733 = 2.6%). The other 202 documented pregnancies ended with spontaneous abortion in 23 cases and live births in 179 cases. The abortion rate (23/202 = 11.4%) did not differ significantly from the control group (81/714 = 11.3%). Four congenital anomalies were reported after intrauterine exposure to paroxetine: clubfeet after exposure throughout pregnancy (40 mg/ day), large naevus flammeus after maternal medication up to wk 7 (100 mg/day), spastic torticollis after medication up to wk 12 (20 mg/ day), unilateral renal agenesia (10 mg/day, long term medication). The rate of congenital anomalies was not increased after application of paroxetine in early pregnancy (4/179 = 2.2% vs 25/633 = 3.9%; relative risk 0.56; 95% confidence interval 0.17, 1.67).

Histology proofed the diagnosis. Postoperative recovery was uneventful with a normally ongoing pregnancy. Results: Because of the pregnancy diagnosis was made with a delay of about 10 days. This was due to the limited possibilities of diagnostic methods and the untypical presentation of symptoms. However, the removal of the left ovary could be performed without further harm to the patient or the fetus. Conclusions: Adnexal torsion in pregnancy is an emergency with high potential risks for patient and pregnancy. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute lower abdominal or back pain, since it can present with untypical symptoms.

The sFlt1/PlGF ratio (ratio) is superior over the single measurement of sFlt1 or PlGF in PE diagnosis. The aim of this study was to characterize the ratio in different types of hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Secondly, we wanted to prove whether the ratio helps to identify women at risk for immediate delivery. Materials and methods: In a multicenter case control trial we investigated 126 patients with PE/HELLP, 35 with pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), 45 with chronic hypertension (cHTN) and 328 controls. SFlt1 and PlGF were measured in serum samples on an automated Elecsys platform. To evaluate the ratio in the course of pregnancy, different timeframes (24-27 +6, 28-33 +6, [34 weeks) were investigated. Hazard Ratios adjusted for gestational age for preeclamptic women in the upper quartile of the ratio were calculated. Results: PE patients showed a higher ratio compared to controls, whereas the ratio was the higher the earlier pregnancy was complicated by PE (668 \u00b1 104 vs. 3.38 \u00b1 0.61 for 24-27 + 6 weeks; 436 \u00b1 63.9 vs. 11.0 \u00b1 3.72 for 28-33 + 6 weeks; 143 \u00b1 18.1 vs. 29.5 \u00b1 5.63 for [34 weeks). However, patients with cHTN and PIH had a significantly lower ratio than patients with PE/HELLP (p \\ 0.001). Overall, a ratio [422 was associated with a 3.5 higher risk of immediate delivery (95% Confidence Interval: 1.98-6.19 ). Pregnancy was significantly prolonged in preeclamptic women with a ratio below the fourth quartile (p \\ 0.001). Conclusions: The automated measurement of the sFlt1/PlGF ratio is able to discriminate between different types of pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders. The measurement of the ratio is able to provide a short-term prediction of pregnancy duration and outcome.

The aim of this study was to determine whether progressive muscle relaxation training affects anxiety and depression levels during pregnancy and puerperium. Another aspect was to assess the satisfaction of the participants regarding the PMR-courses. Materials and methods: A total of 100 women attended this study. The control group, consisting of 50 women, received only general prenatal care. The other 50 women of the intervention group took part in a progressive muscle relaxation training for 5 weeks including one guided group session each week and the instruction to practice at home regularly. In both groups Anxiety (STAI) and depression (BDI) were measured three times: before and after 5 weeks of intervention and during puerperium. The level of satisfaction regarding the subjective effectivity was assessed at the end of the intervention period. There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups regarding the age, parity, gravidity and frequency of complications at the beginning of the study. Results: During the study progress a successive decrease of the State-Anxiety could be observed in the total number of participants (p = 0.004). This trend could also be shown in the two separate groups. Because of the higher level of State-Anxiety scores in the control group (mean 40.88; SD 11.76) compared to the intervention group (mean 37.54; SD 7.36), a significant change could only be exhibited in the control group (p = 0.004). No significant differences could be shown in the PMR-group (p = 0.279), probably because of the lower mean levels of State-Anxiety at the beginning of the study. A decrease of the Trait-Anxiety levels of the total of the participants could also be observed (p \\ 0.05 and p \\ 0.01). A significant reduction of the Trait-Anxiety during pregnancy and in the puerperium could be shown for both groups. There were no significant differences between control group and PMR-group. A reduction of depression levels could be detected at all three points of investigation in the total number of participants (p \\ 0.01). This significant effect could only be shown in the PMR-group (p \\ 0.05) if groups were looked at separately. After the weeks of PMR training the satisfaction and subjective learning effect of the PMR-group participants was assessed. 86.4% of the women stated an obvious improvement of their relaxation abilities. 97.7% of the PMR-group would attend another course during a following pregnancy as far as there would be one offered. All participants declared that they would recommend PMR to other pregnant women. Conclusions: An additional offer of PMR-courses to the general prenatal care leads to an improvement of subjective relaxation abilities during pregnancy and gains a high acceptance within the participants. PMR leads to a reduction of depression scores during pregnancy. No significant effect on State and Trait-Anxiety could be shown in this study, maybe because of the small number of participants.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Universit\u00e4tsfrauenklinik, Ulm, Germany"}, {"text": "PO-Geb 01.57 Acute abdomen in pregnancy caused by torsion of an appendix epiploica *Julia Ferie\u00b41, Hamudi El-Armouche 2 , J\u00fcrgen Tepel 2 , Yves Garnier 1 1 Klinikum Osnabr\u00fcck, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany, 2 Klinikum Osnabr\u00fcck, Department of Surgery, Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Universit\u00e4tsfrauenklinik, Ulm, Germany"}, {"text": "Objective: To increase the awareness of rare causes of lower abdominal pain in pregnancy Materials and methods: A 30 year old G3 P0 presented at 24 + 2 weeks of gestation with right lower quadrant pain since the previous evening.

Therefore, we aimed to determinate LIF-regulated micro-RNAs in a choriocarcinoma cell line model to their potential involvement in control of invasion. Materials and methods: JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells were stimulated with LIF for 1 to 24 h, and total mRNA was isolated. Phosphorylation of signal transducers ERK1/2 (thr 702 and tyr 704) and STAT3 (ser 727 and tyr 705) was assessed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. STAT3 gene expression was analyzed as control of induction by RT-PCR. Expression of five different micro-RNAs, which are either known to be expressed in placental tissue or involved in tumor invasion, was quantified at six time points by qRT-PCR. Results: ERK1/2 and STAT3 were phosphorylated from 10 to 30 min after LIF stimulation. Three micro-RNA, miR-9, miR-141 and let-7g, were time-dependently down-regulated by LIF with a peak after 4 h of treatment, which correlates with an increase of STAT3 expression.

Results: 80 mothers were identified. Out of all mothers 15 had experienced once, 7 twice and 4 three or more times a previous miscarriage, a previous stillbirth or neonatal death. The current pregnancy was the result of artificial reproduction in 8 of the women.

Beyond the 16th week of gestation the fetal urine production is the main part of the amniotic fluid, therefore the oligohydramnion is a consequence of anuria. Occasional a hypoplasia of the cranial bones is described, probably also explained by the reduced perfusion. A deterioration of the kidney function of older children, after intrauterine exposition t ACE-inhibitors in the 3rd trimenon and only temporary anuric kidney failure, is described. It is necessary that patients with contraindicated medication during pregnancy have safe contraception and these patients are to be informed about the risks of treatment. The adverse effect of the ACE-inhibitor treatment needs to be considered as a differential diagnosis of reduced amniotic fluid diagnosed by ultrasound.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1918, "end": 1948, "text": "/Obstetrics, Freiburg, Germany", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PO-Geb 01.65"}, {"text": "PO-Geb 01.72 Prophylactic cerclage: influence of the timing on prolongation of pregnancy ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PO-Geb 01.65"}, {"text": "Objective: Prophylactic cerclage is a widely used procedure to decrease the risk of prematurity.

The method is in detailed description by Pecks et al. 2010 . We now aimed to evaluate the potential diagnostic value of this method in a multicenter setting. Materials and methods: A total of 127 Serum samples of preeclamptic (n = 60) and healthy pregnant women (n = 67) were collected in 4 perinatal care centers. Serum analysis was performed as described previously using MALDI-ToF-MS. Statistical analysis was performed with the ClinProTools (Bruker Daltonik) software package. Results: Our previous results could be confirmed by repeated measuring of the identical samples. Established rules however displayed restricted applicability to center 2, 3 and 4 since predefined cut off values failed at differing peak intensities. Standardizing intensities center-wise by grouping peak intensities of PEs and CNs provided applicability over all centers apart from center 4 where no CNs were available. Therefore those samples were excluded from further calculation. Aiming to improve accuracy on the m/z values, internal calibration based on calculated masses from single and double charged transthyretin ([m + H]+:13,761 Da; [m + H]2+:6,881 Da) was introduced. Newly added samples with larger biological variability amended the pre-established analysis and sample classification reached a sensitivity of 87.8% and a specificity of 73.1%. Note that separate calculations for early-onset PEs only revealed a sensitivity of 90.6% and specificity of 87.2% which are quite comparable to the previously published data.

In contrast the second cluster encompasses genes showing elevated expression in peritoneum from patients without endometriosis but reduced levels in phenotypic normal peritoneal tissue from endometriosis patients as well as in endometriotic lesions. Conclusions: Microarray profiling reveals differences between normal peritoneal tissues from healthy donors and endometriosis patients which may a role in the establishment of this disease. Objective: Endometriosis is a highly prevalent gynecological disease severely affecting the patient's quality of life. To analyze the mechanisms involved in the disease and to identify new molecular targets for the development of effective therapies, small animal models are an important approach. Herein, we report for the first time the use of high-resolution ultrasound imaging for the in vivo analysis of intraperitoneal endometriotic lesions in mice. Materials and methods: Intraperitoneal endometriotic lesions (n = 32) were surgically induced in 8 C57BL/6 mice by transplanting 4 uterine tissue samples into each animal. The volume of developing lesions, their stroma and cysts were analyzed by means of a 40 MHz ultrasound probe (Vevo770, Visualsonics) directly after transplantation as well as at days 7, 14, 21 and 28.

Results: The noninvasive ultrasound technology allows for the repetitive and quantitative analysis of endometriotic lesion growth (d0: 0.90 \u00b1 0.04 mm 3 ; d28: 2.04 \u00b1 0.34 mm 3 ; p \\ 0.05), and adhesion formation with a low intra-and interobserver variability (r 2 = 0.977 and r 2 = 0.970). Moreover, it enables to easily differentiate between endometrial cysts and stroma. Accordingly, volume measurements of both endometrial cysts and stroma indicate that the initial establishment of endometriotic lesions is associated with enhanced cellular proliferation, followed by a phase of increased secretory activity of endometrial glands.

There is some evidence that defective glucose metabolism leads to infertility due to changes in late secretory endometrium and decidualization. Like in malignancies, GLUT-1 seems to be one of the major factors in hypoxia, which might play an essential functional role in endometriosis. There are only few data concerning GLUT-1 expression in eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Materials and methods: Using immunohistochemistry (EnVision FLEX-Kit (Darko Germany)), GLUT-1 expression was examined in endometrium, in peritoneal and in deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).

Conclusions: We support the hypothesis that GLUT-1 is important for a sufficient glucose metabolism in eutopic endometrium. GLUT-1 is known to be a part of the hypoxia induced survival pathway. Our data suggests that there is a difference in the metabolism of stroma and epithelia cells in ectopic endometrial tissue due to hypoxia. Higher levels of steroid hormones receptors known to be common in patients with endometriosis. The cycle-dependent up-regulation of GLUT-1 in late the secretory phase is an indication for an endocrine modulation. This supports the idea that hormonal imbalance leads to endometrial dysfunction due to an altered glucose metabolism. Objective: Endometriosis is a benign but chronic disease and is often associated with pelvic pain and infertility in affected females. Endometriotic cells show increased proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and epithelial endometriotic cells have an increased level of VEGF, an important factor in angiogenesis. We investigate the effects of Cordycepin on proliferation and survival and on the expression of VEGF in epithelial endometriotic cells. Cordycepin (3 0 -deoxyadenosine) is found in the parasitic fungus Cordyceps militaris and has biological activity including anticancer activity. Cordycepin is an inhibitor of poly(A) polymerase (PAP) and inhibits mRNA polyadenylation, leading to shortening of the poly(A)-tail of newly synthesized mRNAs, to de-stabilization of these mRNAs, and to disruption of proteins synthesis. Materials and methods: Immortalized 11z cell cultures were treated with various concentrations of Cordycepin. The effects on proliferation (MTT-assay); expression of p21, cyclins, and VEGF (immunoblotting); apoptosis activation (immunoblotting), and VEGF secretion (ELISA) were determined. Results: Cordycepin treatment inhibited the proliferation of 11z epithelial endometriotic cells, accompanied by upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and downregulation of the cell cycle promoter cyclin D1. Cordycepin inhibited the phosphorylation of the p38 MAP kinase, leading to downregulation of this cytoprotective signaling pathway and thus contributing to inhibition of proliferation and survival. Cordycepin downregulated VEGF expression and reduced the amount of VEGF secreted into the culture medium. Cordycepin activated caspase-dependent, intrinsic apoptosis, as documented by the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and the PARP-1 precursors into their fragments. Conclusions: Cordycepin inhibits proliferation, VEGF production and secretion, and survival of epithelial endometriotic cells and therefore negatively affects three processes crucial to endometriosis.

These dysfunctions could be caused by injury of the autonomous nerves of the presacral space. The aim of our study is to describe the course of the autonomous nerves of the presacral space and to find the best nerve preserving approach for sacropexy. Materials and methods: The autonomous nerves of the presacral space are dissected on six specially preserved female cadavers. Our analysis of the autonomic innervation focused on the following parameters: the exposition of the superior hypogastric plexus with the right and left hypogastric nerves; the dissection of the right sympathetic trunk, paying particular attention to the sacral splanchnic nerves; and the exposition of the ventral rami of the sacral spinal nerves S1-S4 with identification of the origin of the pelvic splanchnic nerves. Results: The superior hypogastric plexus is located in front of the abdominal aorta and its bifurcation and deviates to the left of the midsagittal plane. At the level of the promontory, or just below, the superior hypogastric plexus branches into two hypogastric nerves that run in front of the sacrum. In the presacral space the parasympathetic pelvic splanchnic nerves from the ventral rami of the sacral spinal nerves (S2-S3) join the hypogastric nerves, forming the inferior hypogastric plexus on both sides. From the inferior hypogastric plexus, nerve fibres spread out bilaterally to the pelvic organs. In 2 of 6 cadavers sacral splanchnic nerves could be identified leading from the sacral sympathetic ganglion S1 of the sympathetic trunk to the inferior hypogastric plexus. The anterior longitudinal ligament above the promontory is a safe area for sacopexy.

IVL imitates a malignant neoplasm concerning the pattern of growth and extension. Unusual growth patterns and recurrent forms may be seen as shown in this case report. Materials and methods: We report the case of a 42-year-old woman who was referred to our hospital for a big abdominopelvic tumor. Last history revealed abdominal pain and dyspnoea. An excretory urogram showed an urinary stasis on the right side. A magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis demonstrated the presence of a tumor of the uterus with bladder impression, measuring 12 cm. Physical examination revealed a mobile uterus with a non-fixed tender mass in the pelvis, transvaginal ultrasound the presence of a myomatous uterus. Cystography was negative despite the impression of the bladder. Laboratory findings were normal. In an explorative laparotomy the abdominal tumor was resected and a total hysterectomy without adnexectomy was performed. Histological examination indicated intravenous leiomyomatosis of the uterus. The patient was followed up in our hospital every four months. Three years later the woman presented with a new tumorous mass at the right ovary. Gynaecological ultrasound was suspicious for sactosalpinx. Diagnostic laparoscopy was first performed followed by laparotomy. On surgical exploration an intraligamental myoma was found on the right pelvic side and successfully resected. Histological examination confirmed the intraoperative diagnosis of an intraligamental leiomyoma. Conclusions: IVL is an uncommon neoplasm of the uterus that usually follows a benign course. Nevertheless, metastatic potential seems to play a role in intravenous leiomyomatosis and its recurrence.

Current therapeutical treatment, however, is still insufficient since it is associated with high recurrence rate and unwanted side effects. To develop novel therapeutical approaches, the cell biological mechanisms underlying this disease have to be evaluated. We here focussed on angiogenesis in endometriotic lesions as well as on lymphangiogenesis, the role of which in the pathogenesis of endometriosis is still not understood, in two different immunodeficient mouse strains after transplantation in different ectopic locations. Materials and methods: Human premenopausal endometrium was implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) as well as intraperitoneally (i.p.) into immunodeficient nude mice and Rag1-/-mice and cultured for up to 12 weeks. While nude mice lack functional T-lymphocytes, Rag1-/mice in addition lack functional B-lymphocytes.

Conclusions: Patients with breast cancer and a new onset swelling of the parotid gland, or an acute peripheral facial paralysis may have a differential diagnosis of metastasis of breast cancer. If there is a histologically classified adenocarcinoma of the parotid gland it should be thought of a potential metastasis of breast cancer.

The localization of SLNs with fhSPECT was compared to the position of SLNs detected using gamma probe and blue dye. Results: Preoperatively, 22 primary and 4 secondary SLNs were mapped with conventional scintigraphy. In the pre-excision scan (performed in 13 of 14 patients) fhSPECT managed to map all but 2 SLNs in the identical position as compared to node location at planar scintigrams (23/25). Gamma probe failed to detect any SLN in 2 patients and mapped in total 17 of 26 nodes. 18 SLNs were resected and confirmed to be radioactive. FhSPECT detected 8 remaining lymph nodes in 8 patients after removal of the SLN. In 3 cases additionally detected nodes were resected and confirmed to be radioactive, while in 5 cases no additional lymph nodes were removed as radioactive uptake was low. Pre-excision fhSPECT acquisitions took approx. 3.3 min (SD, 1.3 min) while post-excision scans took 3.2 min (SD, 1.0 min).

Conclusions: Suppressing endogenous PGE 2 by cyclooxygenase inhibition increases CXCL9 release from breast cancer cells and is therefore a pharmacologic candidate to enhance intratumoral immune infiltration. However, due to COX independent mechanisms the choice of the appropriate COX inhibitor seems to be crucial.

We present the case of a 45-year-old female with a body weight of 210 kg who was referred to our institution because of a suspected ovarian mass, progressive abdominal distension and massive ascites. CA125 was elevated at 967 kU/L. Preoperatively the patient was treated symptomatically with repeated paracentesis over 16 days draining 32 L of serous, exsudative fluid with Psammom bodies but no malignant cells. An explorative laparotomy was performed with hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoophorectomy, omentectomy, appendectomy and peritoneal biopsies. Intraoperatively additional 24 L of ascites were drained. Histology revealed adenofibroma of both ovaries with transition to borderline ovarian tumors (BOT). Implants of the omentum were confirmed to be non-invasive by reference pathology. Postoperatively the clinical course was unremarkable with a significant CA125 decrease, no more relevant ascites and a postoperative body weight of 146 kg. Based on the clinical and pathological findings this patient suffered from a Pseudo-Meigs' syndrome presenting with a FIGO stage IIIb BOT and non-invasive implants associated with the largest amount of ascites ever reported for BOT.

Almost 30 years ago the patient has had a unilateral oophorectomy by laparotomy. On CT-scan a bone-like structure was described as an additional finding. During abdominal hysterectomy a rigidification of the abdominal wall was found and a bone-like tumor removed from the abdominal wall. In the following x-ray of the tumor, typical trabecular structures of bone were described. Also histological preparation revealed a bone-like tissue and was described as a Schloffer tumor. Objective: Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva with angiosarcomatoid components are rare malignant tumors of the female genital tract. Materials and methods: A 64-years-old woman who initially presented a squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva (FIGO II, pT2, pN2, G2, R0) underwent a radical vulvectomy with bilateral inguinalfemoral lymphadenectomy followed by adjuvant chemo-radiation in December 2007. Nine months later she presented a lesion in the left inguinal region. Histopathology showed a recurrence of vulvar cancer. We did a radical excision of the lesion and reconstruction with a myocutaneous flap. Five weeks later two small tumours appeared in the scar of myocutaneous flap. The histopathology showed a squamous cell carcinoma with angiosarcomatoid components, a review of the primary tumour-tissue also presented angiosarcomatoid aspects. Because of sudden recurrence of a now high malignant (G3-4) tumour entity we decided a systemic therapy with Caelyx (pegylated liposomal Doxorubicin, 20 mg/m 2 ) and Bevacizumab (10 mg/m 2 ) repeated every 2 weeks. Results: After 10 cycles of systemic chemo-and antibody therapy clinical examination showed a partial of one and a complete response of the other lesion in the left inguinal region. Residua were local excised and the histological examination underlined the CR/PR. After systemic treatment and final operation we can report an 11-months recurrence-free follow up.

For this purpose, we studied the effect of GPR30 agonist G1 alone and in combination with trastuzumab on proliferation and gene expression of breast cancer cell lines SKBR-3, BT-474 (both HER2-overexpressors) and MDA-MB-231 cells as negative control. All cell lines employed were GPR30positive. Proliferation was examined by means of the resazurin-based Cell Titer Blue assay, gene expression was analyzed by means of real time RT-PCR. Treatment with G1 alone inhibited cell growth of all cell lines tested in a dose-dependent manner, and growth inhibition positively correlated with GPR30 expression level. Addition of G1 significantly increased the antiproliferative effect of trastuzumab on BT-474 and SKBR3 cells. On the molecular level, this additive effect of G1 and trastuzumab was accompanied by downregulation of c-fos and cyclin A2 expression. In conclusion, we demonstrated that GPR30 agonist G1 is able to increase the antiproliferative effect of trastuzumab in vitro.

In the course, she developed lung, osseous and liver metastases, whereas re-induction with taxane-containing chemotherapy always led to tumor remission with less side effects and good general state of health. Drug extravasation of docetaxel in the antecubital fossa occurred and was treated with hyaluronidase s.c. and application of cold packs. A few days after the following chemotherapy cycle, she developed a severe erythema with edema, hotness on touch, and pain in the area of previous extravasation necessitating treatment with local steroids, analgetics and antibiotics. The recall dermatitis continued to exacerbate after each course of systemic docetaxel chemotherapy, and finally led to termination of this therapy. In conclusion, recall soft tissue injury after the use of docetaxel in a site of previous extravasation is a new type of skin toxic effect of this chemotherapeutic drug. When skin damage seems to have been fully resolved, caution is needed after an episode of drug extravasation. Even after a therapy interruption of several weeks, resumption of chemotherapy with docetaxel might lead to recrudescence of the inflammatory skin reaction. Objective: Primary pulmonary choriocarcinoma is a rare disease with only 25 reported cases in literature so far. In this report we present the case of a 31-year-old female with primary pulmonary choriocarcinoma initially noticed because of a positive urine pregnancy test. Materials and methods: A 31-year-old woman presented to our outpatient department of gynaecology. A urine pregnancy test performed by the patient because of a delayed period had shown a positive result although her husband is sterilized and the patient was under oral contraceptives because of skin problems. A gynaecologic ultrasound showed normal anatomy and no signs of pregnancy. Quantitative b-HCG serum levels were 516 U/l. A laparoscopy failed to reveal an ectopic pregnancy. Biopsies of both ovaries showed no signs of malignancy or scarring which would have been consistent with old trophoblastic disease or ovarian choriocarcinoma. A D&C obtained no trophoblastic tissue and the endometrium was described as being in the secretory phase. Over several weeks, b-HCG-levels raised up 812 U/l. In order to rule out a mediastinal extragonadal germ cell tumor a CT-scan of the thorax was performed, revealing a peripheral nodule of 1.6 cm 9 1.7 cm in the right upper lobe of the lung. A diagnostic operative excision of the tumor was performed, revealing a choriocarcinoma. At 3 weeks postsurgery b-HCG dropped to less than 5 U/l. Further staging of the patient using PET-CT showed no hypermetabolic lesions, making a metastatic disease highly unlikely. The patient is at well being and refused adjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions: Besides the common differential diagnosis of elevated b-HCG levels one should also consider extragonadal choriocarcinomas. The diagnosis is of great importance for the patient, because notably primary pulmonary choriocarcinomas are mostly unresponsive to surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment.

Choriocarcinoma (CC) is a malignant form of GTD. CC is much more likely than other types of GTD to grow quickly and spread to organs away from the uterus. We present a rare case of exclusive lung manifestation of CC, initially treated as ectopic pregnancy (EP). State of the art algorithms of diagnostic and therapeutic regimen as well as current classifications are given. Materials and methods: Patient (30 year, G2,P2) presented 12 months after term spontaneous delivery with metrorrhagia. Subsequent hCGslevels persisted high. Ultrasound, hysteroscopy and laparoscopy were performed, revealing neither intra-nor EP. Curettage were performed but histology showed not trophoblast tissue. Methotrexate (MTX) was given but hCGs-levels persisted indicated MTX-resistant trophoblastic disease. A PET scan was performed showing a singular apical lesion of the right lung which corresponded with a subpleural nodule in CT-scan. Resection (VATS) was performed and histologic examination revealed CC. Results: The Lesion was classified GTD Stage II/III high risk (WHO Index score [7) and resection was followed by EMA-CO. The lesion was cleared after this regimen and hCGs decreased. Conclusions: High risk GTD spread to genital structures or lungs and without treatment prognosis is generally poor. In this presented case 12 months after delivery a high risk CC occurred. Patient had no evidence of GTD in genitary organs, but a single lesion of CC in the lung as found in a PET scan. Standard treatment is usually an intensive combination chemotherapy regimen such as EMA-CO in combination with surgical removal if possible.

Objective: Uterine leiomyomas (UL) result from the monoclonal proliferation of myometrial cells. Despite their high prevalence surprisingly little is known about their pathogenesis. Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a frequent phenomenon in premalignant lesions that leads to a growth arrest mainly by the activation of two potent growth-inhibitory pathways as represented by p16Ink4a and p19Arf. The relevance of OIS for the development of UL has not been addressed, but HMGA2, encoded by a major target gene of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities in UL, has been implicated in the repression of the Ink4a/Arf (CDKN2A) locus. This prompted us to examine if HMGA2 contributes to the growth of leiomyomas by repressing this locus.

Furthermore, the expression levels of HMGA2, p19Arf, and CDKN1A were found to be correlated with the size of the tumors, indicating that an enhanced growth potential is counterbalanced by the p19Arf pathway. Mechanistically, the UL may thus execute a program already present in their cell of origin, where it can be activated to protect the genome, for example, in the case of enhanced proliferation. This also explains the low frequency of malignant transformation towards leiomyosarcomas.

Objective: about 445.000 disabled women live in Bavaria, who face a lot of unique challenges in accessing medical care. They report an insensitivity to their specific health care needs. More than healthy individuals disabled women have a wide array of health-related issues, including multiple concurrent co-morbidities, psychosocial issues, an socioeconomic concerns. Overall, they experience a fragmented health care delivery-system that often is inadequate in important areas such as reproductive health, post-reproductive health and sexuality. In order to address these issues, the Klinikum Dachau institutionalized an outpatient service for disabled women in the rooms of the hospital. The mission of this clinic is to develop a model of comprehensive women-centered care with special focus to their disabilities. Materials and methods: From November 2007 to January 2010 we performed 263 examinations of disabled women, the majority of them had neurologic disorders such as cerebral pulsy, multiple sclerosis, and paraplegia after injuries of the spine.

Objective: One severe complication of lymphadenectomy in ovarian cancer patients is postsurgical lymphfistulas causing chyloric ascites. Treatment of this complication ends often in surgical closure of the fistula. Here we report a new conservative treatment of such patients with Somatostatin. This hormone is produced naturally in the pancreas, in particular cells of the gastrointestine and in the hypothalamus. A synthetic Somatostatin is Octreotid which inhibits the production of pancreas enzymes to treat severe bleedings of the gastrointestine and postoperative fistulas of the pancreas and upper gastrointestine.

All patients had a higher stage of disease. They all had positive lymph nodes and underwent typical radical surgery including pelvin and paraaortal lymphadenectomy. Due to high loss of chylous ascites (average amount of 1000 ml per day) after surgery the patients received a treatment with either Bendatreotid 100 lg 39 a day or Sandostatin 100 lg twice a day accompanied by parenteral nutrition due to fasting.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PO-Onko 01.102"}, {"text": "Results: At the end of the Somatostatin treatment average loss of fluid was 200 ml to a trace.

The developmental potential of ovarian tissue fragments may vary individually and depends on various factors. Here we used the common marmoset monkey as a non-human primate model to study the effects of host treatment and graft duration on the number and morphological integrity of unadvanced follicles in xenografted adult ovarian tissue. Materials and methods: Ovarian tissues were collected from healthy adult marmosets. Tissue fragments were cryopreserved, stored for at least 4 weeks and thawed prior to grafting to ovariectomized and intact nude mice. Grafts were retrieved after 2, 4 and 8 weeks. Following exgrafting, the tissue was routinely processed and evaluated for number and morphological appearance of follicles. Results: Following xenografting of cryopreserved ovarian tissue fragments, the mean number of primordial follicles decreases dramatically 2 weeks post grafting (39.1 \u00b1 4.7 vs 6.9 \u00b1 0.7, p \\ 0.05), and then remains unchanged after 4 weeks (6.9 \u00b1 2.2) and 8 weeks (4.8 \u00b1 0.5), respectively. This effect, however, is limited to the subclass of primordial follicles; the population of primary follicles remains stable after grafting when compared to tissues prior to grafting. No significant difference is shown between fresh and cryopreserved tissues regarding the relative number of primordial follicles; however, the proportion of morphologically normal unadvanced follicles is significantly lower in cryopreserved tissues post grafting. Host ovarectomy does not change the ratio between primordial and primary follicles, but allows for a higher mean unadvanced follicle number in grafted fresh tissues (24.8 \u00b1 3.2% vs 12.5 \u00b1 3.6%, p \\ 0.05).

However, sperm analysis showed an complete azoospermia. The reason was not as expected, an age related azoospermia, but an epidemic parotitis (mumps), which the male received at the age of 32, years after his two children were born. Mumps is known to cause sterility in men; a postpubertal mumps orchitis is associated in 20-40% of the males with azoospermia. In such cases regular infertility treatment is not successful.

The current study applies the ethics of moral sentimentalism, based on the reflections of David Hume (1711-1767), a Scottish philosopher of the age of enlightenment on the moral status of the embryo. The fact that in Germany abortion is common and socially accepted, while at the same time preimplantation diagnostics (PID) is forbidden, represents a paradox, which we try to explain resorting to the ethical concept of moral sentimentalism. David Hume observed that moral reflections and decisions in humans are rather driven by the passions than by reason. This speculative concept is supported by recently published neuroimaging studies. Scientific innovations are often seen with distrust, due to modern myths, such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Aldous Huxley's ''Brave New World''. Secondly, our Christian background causes a special sensitivity towards science concerning the beginnings of life. Last but not least, in Germany due to our particular history, genetic testing has a negative connotation. Thus, a scientific innovation, such as PID, frequently induces a vague feeling of anxiety in the spectator. Accordingly, such new methods are at first morally rejected by the majority. However, by sheer force of habit these innovations are frequently meet with indifference and finally morally approved in the course of time. This development could be observed in different areas of medicine, such as heart transplant and in vitro fertilization. According to David Hume's ethical concept the different moral value of the embryo in the uterus and in the petri dish are based on different stages of moral adaption. Thus, moral sentimentalism cannot establish the moral status of the embryo as a fixed constant. By clarifying, that our moral judgement does not base exclusively on reason and rationality, it can however raise the ongoing debate paradoxically to a more rational level.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden, Dresden, Germany"}, {"text": "Heparin has anti-inflammatory effects on the human endometrium by interacting with TNF-a-and IFN-csignaling *Herbert Fluhr 1 , Julia Spratte 1 , Marek Zygmunt 1 1", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PO-Repro 01.11"}, {"text": "Objective: The pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interferon (IFN)-c are secreted by immune cells and have an influence on the implantation of the embryo in the endometrium.

C60 fullerenes which consist of 60 carbon atoms in the shape of a football are considered for imaging probes, antioxidants, or drug carriers. However, since they are insoluble in aqueous media it is difficult to study their activities in biological systems. Therefore, organic solvents are used for solubilization of fullerenes in water. The aim was to determine if fullerenes may also be used in ovarian applications by examining the interleukin 6 (IL-6) and 1beta (IL-1beta) production in cultured granulosa cells. Materials and methods: Granulosa cells obtained during in vitro fertilisation treatment were cultured in microplates either with 0.025, 0.1, or 0.4 mg/ml C60 fullerenes, respectively, which were prepared by two methods: a) Wells were coated with a fullerene-methanolsuspension following solvent evaporation and cell seeding. b) Fullerenes dissolved in toluene were transferred into water by sonication and added to the cells. After four days IL-6 and IL-1beta were quantified in the culture supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared between fullerene-treated and untreated cells. Results: As shown by ELISA granulosa cells secreted much more IL-6 than IL-1beta.

Materials and methods: Culture and decidualization (induced by progesterone and cyclo-AMP incubation for 72 h) of immortalized human endometrial stroma cells (dES) (cell line St-T1) was followed by a pre-incubation with MAPKinase, STAT3-and JNK-inhibitor for 2 h and a subsequent treatment with 0.1 ng/ml recombinant human IL-1\u00df for 48 h. Cell culture supernatants were collected and frozen, RNA and protein isolated after the modified single-step method. Subsequent 2 lg RNA each were reverse transcribed and PCR performed for \u00df-actin and prolactin mRNA. Supernatant of \u00df-actin and prolactin positive samples were then measured for CXCL1 secretion via ELISA. Results: Incubation with 25 lM of MAPKinase inhibitor lead to a statistically significant decrease of about 60% of the CXCL1 secretion in dES cell culture supernatants compared to only IL-1\u00df treated controls. 250 lM of STAT3 and 100 lM of JNK inhibitor reduced the CXCL1 secretion in dES cell culture supernatant of about 35 and 30%, respectively. Conclusions: The early fetal-maternal dialogue between embryonically derived IL-1\u00df and decidual CXCL1 is primarily mediated via MAPK-signalling in vitro.

Objective: Gestational malaria infection and HELLP syndrome show a big overlap in clinical and laboratory findings. Malaria not only increases maternal morbidity and mortality but also contributes to significant perinatal morbidity and mortality. Incubation time between mosquito bite and clinical symptoms may in rare cases exceed two months complicating early diagnosis.

CTG-controls showed a slightly increased fetal heart rate with a baseline of 160 bpm. Within two days the laboratory controls revealed aggravating thrombocytopenia, signs of hemolysis and an increase in transaminases to the 1.5-2 fold upper normal limits.

Objective: The activities are aimed towards establishing an Institute of Quality Assurance in Obstetrics to improve the chances of survival for mothers and their children. Materials and methods: The project commenced in January 2008 with 10 hospitals from Kano State and Kaduna State of Nigeria. With an audit the structure of the hospitals were investigated: equipment status and hygienic conditions were established using a ''hospital score''. The hospitals participated in a continuous monthly collection of data pertaining to maternal and child mortality and morbidity. In half yearly quality circles, staff from the participating hospitals discuss under supervision the unrecognizably results of each hospital. Results: The structure and hygienic status of the hospitals exhibited deficits in many areas. There was a close relationship between the ''hospital score'' and maternal mortality. Following the continuously collection of data and discussion of the results, average MMR decreased from 1790/100,000 in first half year 2008 to 0.94/100,000 in second half year 2009. The average FMR remained roughly unchanged during the time of observation: 84.9/1000 in 2008 and 83.5/1000 in 2009. The MMR was related to the total number of deliveries in a hospital, increasing in hospitals with lower delivery rates. A similar relationship was found for FMR. There was no correlation with the CS-rate, which fell from 6.6% in 2008 to 5.3% in 2009. Conclusions: Quality assurance in obstetrics is a continuous process of analysing, discussing and reducing the MMR and FMR with the guidance of an Institute of Quality Assurance. This might be a model Objective: Due to extremely low rates of maternal mortality in the modern medical setting, new indicators for the monitoring of maternal health like need for transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) have to be identified. This study aims to assess the causes of obstetric admissions to ICUs at the General Hospital of Vienna, Austria, and to evaluate the predictive ability of the APACHE II Scoring System in obstetric patients. Furthermore the most seriously affected patients and the factors most likely associated with severe morbidity are identified. Materials and methods: A retrospective chart review of obstetric patients who were admitted between the second trimester of pregnancy and 6 weeks post partum to an ICU of the General Hospital of Vienna, a tertiary care university hospital, between 1996 and 2009 was carried out. Results: 252 patients were included which makes this data pool one of the largest ones of its kind. The observed mortality rate amounts to 2.8% while the mean one calculated by the APACHE II Scoring system is 13.3%. A majority of patients (77.6%) was admitted for complications associated with pregnancy, the most common indications being (pre-)eclampsia and HELLP (31.6%) and major hemorrhage (32.8%).

Materials and methods: A 32-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 2 (vaginal delivery, cesarean section), who had been diagnosed with a placenta previa, was referred at 24 weeks of gestation. The findings of our ultrasound examination with color Doppler and MRI were consistent with a diagnosis of placenta previa percreta. The cystoscopy showed no mucosal invasion. An elective cesarean with vertical fundal incision was performed at 33 weeks of gestation. A healthy, 2015-g female was delivered. Hysterectomy was postponed to avoid major bleeding as bladder was closely adhered to uterine wall and massive varicous veins were present. The placenta was not removed. A bilateral transarterial embolization of the uterine arteries was performed by radiologists on the 10th postoperative day. A total hysterectomy was planned.

Materials and methods: The heterogeneous group of congenital and acquired myasthenia syndromes is clinically characterized by an insufficient neuromuscular transmission leading to progressive paresis. In the case of maternal myasthenia gravis both the mother and the child may develop myasthenia symptoms with varying degrees of weakness and progressive fatigability of the skeletal muscles. We present the case of a patient with a life threatening complication due to myasthenia gravis shortly after an elective cesarean section. We emphasize the necessity of interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic strategies during the perinatal period. Results: We report the case of a 38 year old patient with immunemediated myasthenia gravis, who underwent a secondary cesarean section with spinal anesthesia at 35 + 3 weeks of pregnancy, after a premature rupture of membranes. The newborn was transferred to the pediatric hospital for surveillance and did not show any signs of muscular weakness throughout the first week of life. The mother developed a myasthenic crisis characterized by progressive dyspnoea leading to a respiratory insufficiency during the second postpartum day. A generalized seizure with cardiac-circulatory arrest followed. After successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The interdisciplinary therapeutic approach included ventilatory assistance via endotracheal intubation, parenteral pyridostigmine, azathioprine and steroids. A stable state was regained, so that after five days of intensive care treatment the patient was transferred to normal ward and in the course of time could be dismissed. Objective: The rupture of an unscarred uterus is a very rare and one of the most dangerous complications in obstetrics, associated with a high risk for maternal and fetal mortality. Materials and methods: A 33-year-old gravida 4, para 2 with 2 prior vaginal deliveries without any complications received 25 lg misoprostol to induce labour at 41 + 4 weeks of gestation. In patient history there was an abortion and the patient underwent curettage. 5 hours 30 min after application of misoprostol the patient presented a sudden pain and a minimal vaginal bleeding while she had mild contractions. Simultaneously a fetal bradycardia was registrated. An emergency Caesarean section was performed. A rupture of the uterus on the left posterior side from uterine fundus to the internal cervix was seen. The cervix itself was unaffected and 2 cm open. The child was lying in the abdominal cavity. After cutting the umbilical cord the baby was given to the attendant paediatrics (NapH 6.82, APGAR 1/5/7).

Every induction of labour has a higher risk of an uterus rupture even by an unscarred uterus. It is hypothesized that the pathophysiology of preeclampsia begins with shallow trophoblast invasion leading to placental hypoxia. Hypoxia is a potent stimulus for the release of adenosine. Women with preeclampsia show increased circulating concentrations of adenosine and placental expression of adenosine receptors is increased in preeclampsia. We describe a case of malformation of the umbilical vessels resulting in an IUGR. We explain diagnostic and clinical management. First visit of the 32-year-old first Gravida was in 27 + 5 week showing a dysproportional IUGR, especially of the fetal abdomen. Sonomorphology of the organs was normal, TORCH and amniotic fluid index as well. Doppler of the maternal system showed normal uterine perfusion. Umbilical Doppler was normal but Doppler of Arteria cerebri media (ACM, PI 0.94, RI 0.59) and ductus venosus (DV, PI 1.02) showed pathological results. The fetus did not show any abdominal growing over the next 3 weeks, while the BIP and the femur were growing normally. Doppler did not deteriorate any further but remained as described above. Repeated sonographical screening for fetal malformation resulted in the diagnosis of an anastomosis between the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein in the abdominal wall and a crossing of both umbilical vein in the same location. Pathophysiological patterns focussed on normal Doppler of the umbilical artery while ACM and DV are pathological are discussed as well as management of surveillance and timing of delivery. The baby was delivered by caesarean in 30 + 5 weeks with a weight of 980 g.

Further genetic analysis of the remaining family members showed that the two sisters and one brother were affected by Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Objective: Partial moles arise from the trophoblastic epithelium of the placenta. The availability of ultrasonography has led to early diagnosis. Materials and methods: We present two cases with a partial mole and different pregnancy outcome. Results: In both cases an abnormal placental structure was diagnosed at second trimester ultrasound examination. The first patient presented with transient vaginal bleeding. The fetus had normal anatomy and size for gestational age. An echogenic placenta was located on the right and a normal placenta on the left uterus wall. Amniocentesis revealed a normal karyotype. hCG was 449503 mlU/ml. After pregnancy with decrease of the mole part of the placenta, a healthy child was spontaneously born at 40 weeks of gestation. The histologic examination showed a regressive hydatidiform mole combined with a placental retardation in dichorionic twin pregnancy. Invasive growth did not appear. The second patient had an echogenic placenta with cystic structures and a normal fetus. At 27 + 0 the fetus showed a significant growth retardation and massive increase of the cystic part of the placenta. With normal uterine and umbilical doppler parameters. V max in the middle cerebral artery was elevated. A distinct anemia with hemoglobin 4.7 g/dl, thrombopenia and signs of consumptive coagulopathy was found. Fetal blood transfusions were performed twice. A maximum of hemoglobin 6.8 g/dl was achieved. The preterm delivery through cesarean section was performed because of persistent anaemia and thrombopenia. Blood transfusion after birth was necessary. The histologic examination showed a partial mole with a hypertrophic placenta with no signs of invasive growth. Conclusions: There were no significant differences in the rate of uterine ruptures or the emergency C-sections between the misoprotol and the other methods for induction of labor in women with a single prior uterine scar.

Two months after curettage of missed abortion she presented with severe vaginal bleeding. Clinical examination revealed a lesion of the epithelial outside surface of the cervix. Due to the bleeding immediate surgical intervention was necessary. Histological examination revealed a complete hydatidiform mole. Currently, only three cases of this exceedingly rare diagnosis have been published. Two cases are reporting on a partial hydatidiform mole and only one case on a complete hydatidiform mole. All cases presented with vaginal bleeding and needed surgical intervention, although in one case initially metothrexate was applied. In this case, we hypothesize that the pathogenesis took place in two steps. Initially, during fertilization, a hydatidiform molar pregnancy developed. Normally this abnormal trophoblast tissue would adhere to the endometrium, but in this case we assume that the endometrial linage was damaged and intrauterine implantation was not possible because of the prior curettage. This circumstance provided the possibility for the abnormal trophoblast tissue to pass the endocervix and to emerge into vaginal vault. Presumably, during the curettage an epithelial defect was set on the outside surface of the cervix. This defect was set by clamping the cervix while dilatation. We speculate that this weak spot of the epithelial surface was responsible for the adherence to the cervix and subsequent bleeding was caused by injury of maternal blood vessels. We present a case with cervical hydatidiform mole as a rare differential diagnosis in vaginal bleeding after dilatation and curettage. We speculate that the defect set by dilatation of the cervix has provided the possibility for the adherence of the abnormal trophoblast tissue and therefore propose that careful holding of the cervix with atraumatic clamps while curettage is important to avoid subsequent complications.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Universit\u00e4ts-Frauenklinik, Ulm, Germany"}, {"text": "PO-Geb/Repro 02.04 Obesity and pregnancy: maternal BMI over 15 years Objective: Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), a novel member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) superfamily has recently been described to be produced in high levels by placental tissue.

Nonetheless, there is wide-spread debate about the moral and legal status of the early stages of life. This German survey of 700 infertile patients analyzes the attitudes and decisions of patients about potential cryopreserved embryos and their cyropreserved pronucleus stages.

During the course of intensive care, the case was complicated by recurrent infections and fever, treated with a wide spectrum of antibiotics. The patient was admitted to our emergency room unconscious with severe head trauma after an automobile accident. Multiple skull fractures were accompanied by multiple brain hematomas and cerebral edema. After acknowledgment of the patient's state of pregnancy, radiological diagnostics were limited to head and upper spine. The patient was eventually transferred to intensive care unit ventilated and under analog sedation. In order to maintain an adequate brain perfusion, therapy with catecholamine and noradrenalin was started. In the following months the patient had to undergo intermittent antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxon, imipenem, vancomycin, tazobactam and amphotericin B. Due to repetitive seizures the patient received treatment with carbamazepin. The fetal prognosis under the severe condition and the aggressive therapy of the patient was discussed with family members and the continuation of the pregnancy as well as maximal therapy for the unborn child was decided on. During the following months fetal development was without pathological findings both in ultrasound and fetal heart tracking. In her 15th week of pregnancy, after seven weeks of intensive care treatment, the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic. At this point the patient was capable of breathing spontaneously with stable vital parameters and started to react to her surroundings. Despite fecal incontinence and therefore limited hygienic circumstances, ascending infection did not occur. The patient is now in her 30th week of pregnancy with normal fetal biometry, normal fetoplacental and uteroplacental perfusion, all fetal organs seem to be developed as expected by ultrasound diagnostics. Delivery of the baby is planned at 37 weeks of pregnancy by cesarean section. Objective: Vitamin D is a prohormone that plays an important role in various physiological processes, e.g. calcium metabolism, cellular growth and differentiation, immunity and cardiovascular regulation, and also for maintaining oral health through effects on bone and mineral metabolism and immunomodulatory action by interference with proinflammatory cytokines. The vit D receptor has dual functions as an endocrine receptor and metabolic sensor. The activity of vit D3 in preventing rickets and osteoporosis is well known, but the extent of inadequate supply in Germany is uncertain. Materials and methods: Screening was prospectively performed in the winter period (end of October-April) and included a total of 206 consecutive women, who attended the outpatient endocrine clinic for menopausal complaints or disorders of the menstrual cycle, and who were not on vit D3 substitution. The median age was 54 (range 14-86) years. 25-hydroxy(OH)D3 (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) as the major form of vit D in the circulation was determined by means of a standard serum assay. Vit D deficiency was defined as concentration \\20 ng/ml, severe deficiency as serum levels \\10 ng/ml. Objective: Prospective analysis of 16 patients undergoing gynaecological laparoscopy using freehand robotic camera-holding device. This study evaluates its introduction into clinical praxis. Materials and methods: A total of 16 patients underwent roboticassisted laparoscopic surgery such as hysterectomy, adnexectomy and cystectomy at the same institution, during the same period and with the same surgeon. Perioperative data (operation time, blood loss, time for assembly, comfort for the surgeon, roboter-handling, obstructions for the surgeon or the assistance caused by roboter) was collected prospectively. Demographic data, pre-existing diseases, previous abdominal or pelvic operations, postoperative development and length of stay were retrieved from patient's records. We used the freehand camera-holder, attached to the surgical table, controlled via surgeon's head movements by a head-mounted optical emitter. Movements are detected by a sensor mounted atop laparoscopic video monitor. The sensor indicates intended direction of motion through displaying a LED arrow. Surgeon initiates and terminates movements with a foot pedal. Results: Mean time from suture to docking the robotic-arm was 5.13 min (r = 2.6 min). 10 procedures were successfully completed without any intra-operative complication. No conversions to laparotomy were necessary. No major intra-or post-operative complications occurred. In only one case post-operative minor complication was detected (suspected urinome). In all cases camerapositioning was steady with barely no inadvertent movements. In 56% human assistance could be saved. Conclusions: Robotic devices permit tremor-free imaging and can eliminate need for assistance.

Surgical procedure: A few weeks prior to the surgical procedure the patient was asked to dilatate the vaginal stump with a vaginal dilatator. Thereby the length of the vaginal pit was about 3 cm. The patient was operated under general anaesthesia. For the endoscopic approach three additional suprapubic incisions are needed. The pouch of Douglas is opened up and a tunnel is prepared between the bladder and rectum. For a better orientation we place a thick Hegar's dilatator into the vaginal stump during this preparation. The tension thread is then passed with a straight needle from the vaginal stump through the prepared tunnel into abdominal cavity and connected to a vaginal dilatator.

Today, its diagnosis relies on symptoms evaluation (urgency, frequency, pain) in combination with cystoscopic and histological evidence. A molecular marker for an objective diagnosis is highly desired. Towards this goal, comparative gene expression profiles of bladder biopsies from patients with ulcerative IC/PBS and control patients have been performed. Materials and methods: Cold-cup biopsies from bladder tissue were collected from five ulcerative IC/PBS patients and from six healthy controls. After total-RNA extraction, gene expression profiles have been generated using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays. HE staining of paraffin sections has been performed. Selected gene expressions were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan Assays, Applied Biosystems). Results: GeneChip expression arrays cover all known human mRNAs. More than 31,000 of over 54,000 tested probe sets were present (detection p value \\0.05). The difference between the disease and the control group was significant for over 3,500 signals (t test p value \\0.01), and approximately 1,000 genes showed a disease-to-healthy expression ratio greater than two. The found gene expressions show similarities to patterns from immune system, lymphatic, and autoimmune diseases. The dominant biological processes were the immune and inflammatory reactions.

The other patient who primarily underwent LASH and sacral cervicopexy is now scheduled for anterolateral fasciocervicopexy (Waaldijk). Conclusions: Abdominal sacropexy is considered to be a gold standard in prolapse surgery. Combined with the advantages of minimal invasive surgery these short term results appeared as effective and safe. Using suture techniques at the presacral site we found no complications such as vertebral osteomyelitis or mesh expulsion as previously described by others. Objective: The Y-box binding protein YB-1 is involved in a variety of biological functions such as DNA transcription and repair and translational control of protein synthesis. The protein is highly expressed in a number of malignant diseases and is described as an oncogen regarding ovarian cancer in particular. The benign, chronic inflammatory disease endometriosis shares many characteristics with malignant diseases, like strong dissemination and invasion in affected tissues, increased angiogenesis and high numbers of recurrence. The objective of our study was to examine the expression of YB-1 in human endometrium and endometriosis. Materials and methods: Endometrium, endometriotic tissues and peritoneal fluid were obtained from patients undergoing laparoscopy at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of L\u00fcbeck. Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry were performed in tissues and primary cultures of epithelial and stromal cells respectively. Cell cultures were prepared from endometriotic tissues and control endometrium and peritoneal macrophages were isolated from peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis as well as from healthy controls. YB-1 gene and protein expression were analyzed by quantitative real time PCR and Western Blot. Results: YB-1 was statistically significant and more strongly expressed in endometrium, endometriotic lesions and peritoneal macrophages of patients with endometriosis in comparison to controls. Strongest YB-1 expression was observed in the epithelial compartment of endometriotic lesions. Objective: The complexity of endometriosis and its diverse physical, emotional and social medical impacts pose major problems not only for the patient but also for the physician. Women with endometriosis differ greatly in terms of coping-strategies. The present study aimed to identify different patient groups to improve care. Materials and methods: The population of a study on the development and implementation of an outpatient education programme for women with endometriosis served as the basis of the analysis. Two-step cluster analysis was performed to identify three clusters based on the variables ''age'', ''disease duration'', and ''delayed diagnosis''. A unifactorial variance analysis variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison of mean values. Results: In total, 115 cases were included in the three clusters. The first cluster was a group of 44 women characterized by the highest mean age (44 years) and the longest duration of disease (13 years). Deep exhaustion was the most important symptom in this group. The second cluster consisted of a subgroup with a mean age of 36 years and a disease duration of 3.4 years. These patients had the highest pain scores and the worse quality of life scores. The most striking feature in this group was the extremely long delay in diagnosis, amounting to 16 years on average. The third cluster consisted of young women (31 years) with a short duration of disease (3.4 years) and a short delay in diagnosis (2.1 years) who had a problem-oriented approach to dealing with the disease. Conclusions: We expect that the analysis of psychological comorbidities at the 12-months-follow-up will show starting points to produce strategies for more selective treatment of endometriosis.

So far there is not one single classification system which would allow to depict the disease in all its facets such as the desire to have children, pain and extent. The AFS classification system is currently the most widely used system of classification, but it does not take deep infiltrating endometriosis into account. This is why, complementary to AFS classification, the ENZIAN score was developed as a staging system which also includes deep infiltrating endometriosis. The aim of the following study is to demonstrate that the ENZIAN score is a proper tool for classifying deep infiltrating endometriosis when combined with the AFS classification system. However, it can be shown that certain localisations of endometriosis may be classified in both systems.

Based on a formerly described allele-specific pool-screening, the semi nested PCR is substituted by a one-step method in combination with solid-phase technique and chemiluminometric detection. Materials and methods: The allele-specific PCR was designed to discriminate between T and G changing the amino acid 300 from Cysteine to Glycine in the breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA-1). The PCR products were coupled via their Biotin label to Streptavidin-coated microtiter plates. For chemiluminometric measurement an A(lcaline)-P(hosphatase)-labeled monoclonal anti-Digoxigenin-antibody was added.

Further investigations on possible radiosensitizing effects of N-TSP2-Fc are currently being performed. We report on a 30 year old woman presenting with hyperemesis gravidarum and subsequent vomiting at the end of the first trimester. The patient initially presented with nausea and vomiting, without any abdominal pain. Clinical symptoms increased and the patient complained suddenly severe dyspnoe and intractable cough. Therefore immediately a chest x-ray was performed showing a severe left sided diaphragmatic hiatus hernia with an intra-thoracal stomach, making immediate surgical intervention necessary. Diaphragmatic hernias complicating pregnancy are a rare event, they normally occur in later periods of pregnancy due to the rising intra-abdominal pressure caused by the enlargement of the uterus. Also maternal diaphragmatic hernias during pregnancy are usually associated with minor complains. However, they can be life threatening, due to mediastinal shift and cardio-respiratory failure. The majority of maternal diaphragmatic hernias complicating pregnancies occur in antenatal period, most of them in the 3rd trimester. More than 90% of maternal diaphragmatic hernias complicating pregnancy are localized on the left side of the diaphragma. Usually maternal diaphragmatic hernias become clinically obvious in advanced stage of pregnancy, in contrast hyperemesis gravidarum is normally occurring in the first trimester and is usually self-limiting. Guiding symptoms for hyperemesis gravidarum are nausea and vomiting, but can also be unspecific symptoms of a maternal diaphragmatic hernia. Therefore especially mild variants of maternal diaphragmatic hernias in early pregnancy can be misdiagnosed as hyperemesis gravidarum.

There are a very large number of undetected cases of incontinence patients whose incontinence reduces their quality of life although this could largely be prevented by a preterm intervention. The continence function is one of the first social as well as control functions which is gained within a child's development and is generally considered to be an indicator for other social as well as control functions. Until today different definitions have been used for a complex of symptoms which is called overactive bladder. There is a big prevalence for this complex of symptoms which will increase due to the age development and, therefore, is of great interest. The hyperactive bladder (overactive bladder, OAB) includes the storage symptoms pollakisuria, imperative urge to urinate and nycturia with or without incontinence but these symptoms are always in the absence of local, metabolic, neurological or endocrine pathology. As a consequence the diagnosis ''OAB'' can initially only be suspected in the presence of those symptoms. It will become definite, however, once the symptoms have been properly diagnosed. Today a physician who works at a practise or hospital does not have enough time to review the large number of therapeutic recommendations of different sources and to verify whether the propagated treatment options are scientifically proven. Every year approx. 2 million articles are published in over 10,000 scientific journals.

Objective: Implantation of transobturatoric meshes is frequently used in the surgical treatment of cystocoeles. Wound healing problems with mesh extrusions are frequently observed. We determined bacterial colonisation of the vagina and analyzed the relation to mesh extrusions. Materials and methods: In our prospective multicenter study 200 patients with Cystoceles underwent surgical transobturatoric mesh implantation. The microbiological colonisation and the pH-Value of the vaginal fluid was analyzed before surgery, after 3 months and after 12 months. Results: 194 patients were evaluated either after three months and 186 after 1 year. The extrusion rate at 3 months was 7.2% (14/194) and 5.9% at 12 months. The preoperative ph-values were not statistically different in patients with or without extrusions at 3 or 12 months follow up examination (5.0/5.3 at 3 months resp. 5.0/5.4). A colonisation with physiologic vaginal bacteria was observed in 64% of patients preoperatively, in 68% at 3 months and in 60% at 12 months. Colonisation with physiologic bacteria was not correlated to extrusions at 3 months, but we observed a statistically significant correlation between preoperative physiological colonisation and extrusion rates at 12 months. Patients without an extrusion had a physiological bacterial colonisation in 67.7% in contrast to 34.4% Patients with an extrusion (p = 0.046). A coloisation with pathogenic bacteria like streptococci, staphylococci or pseudomonas species was observed in 17% of patients preoperatively, in 19% at 3 months and in 19% at 12 months. Colonisation with pathogenic bacteria was not correlated to extrusion rates. Conclusions: An unphysiologic bacterial colonisation of the vagina is frequently observed in patients with POP. A colonisation of the vagina with physiological bacteria may prevent mesh extrusions in patients with mesh augmented surgery for POP, but overall mesh extrusion rates were only slightly related to bacterial colonisation of the vagina.

Searching for the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells, a pan-cytokeratin antibody (mAb A45-B/B3) was used to identify cytokeratin 8, 18 and 19 positive cells. After immunohistochemical colour reaction, the samples were analyzed by Ariol SL-50 System automatically. Results: Although the sentinel lymph node was free of tumour cells, we found cytokeratin 8-, 18-and 19-positive epithelial cells within the bone marrow indicating micrometastases. So far spreading of the MCC tumour is routinely only analyzed by SLNB. The patient received radiotherapy of the breast and the axilla. Systemically we administer bisphosphonates for 3 years (Clodronat 1600 mg/die per os or Zoledronat 4 mg i.v. every 6 months), to eliminate the micrometastases as an analogy to encouraging results of treatment of breast cancer micrometastases. Conclusions: Few cases of primary MCC of the breast have been reported in literature only and-to our knowledge-so far no detection of disseminated tumour cells (DTC) as an early sign of spreading of disease.

However, TAM is one risk factor for developing endometrial carcinoma (EnCa). This study's aim is to contribute towards our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of TAM's tissue-specific contrary mode of action between mammary and endometrial tissues. Materials and methods: To determine total and phosphorylated protein expression Immunoblotting was performed on endometrial tissues, and with TAM-treated EnCa and Mamma-Ca cell lines time kinetics were analyzed. Using molecular cloning and transfections, the PTEN status of RL95-2 EnCa cells was rescued. Results: We observed deregulation of phosphorylation within the IGF-AKT axis in endometrial tissues from patients with TAM therapy. Protein deregulations occurred in benign pre-stages of EnCa and included increased total protein and phosphorylation levels of ER, AKT, PTEN and mTOR. Kinetic studies following TAM treatment of the PTEN mutated RL95-2 EnCa cell line demonstrated induction of pERa-S118 and pAKT-T308. These effects occurred within minutes, pointing towards an additional non-genomic TAM mode of action. TAM treatment of four EnCa and MaCa cell lines, differing in their ER and PTEN statuses, was performed to compare PI3 K-AKT-mTOR signaling with RL95-2 EnCa cells (ER+, PTEN-) showing highest levels of AKT activation following TAM treatment and the Mamma-Ca HTB-26 line (ER-, PTEN+) exhibiting lowest levels.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PO-Onko 02.80"}, {"text": "Conclusions: We propose that following TAM treatment, the ER and PTEN status of a tissue dictates the level of AKT activation.

Objective: Laparoscopic surgery is associated with a reduced morbidity. Compared to open access, postoperative pain is reduced. The aim of this study was to analyse the intensity and course of postoperative pain and the influence of co-factors (adipositas, duration of operation, drugs). Materials and methods: 287 patients suffering from genital prolapse higher than I\u00b0and laparoscopic sacropexy were included. Patients were asked postoperatively to evaluate their pain using a four point verbal rating scale (VRS). Additionally medical records were analysed concerning drug application and co-factors. Results: Patients could distinguish between abdominal pain and shoulder pain after laparoscopy. Shoulder pain was rarely influenced by drugs, but disappeared after two to three days. Abdominal pain showed a maximum at day one and a good response to non-steroidal antiphlogistics. Best results were found after Diclofenac (3 9 50 mg/ day) and Ibuprofen (2-3 9 400-600 mg/day). The few cases treated with specific Cox-2 inhibitors (Etoricoxib) showed a tendency to very good results (application of only one tablet at all).

In gynecology there is a broad spectrum of possible interventions. Materials and methods: So far 125 patients underwent a surgical procedure with the daVinci system. Recruitment occurred by the outpatient clinic. Selection criterias were complex gynecological pathologies (complex fibroids, cervical and endometrial cancer, etc.). Principal aim was to avoid laparotomy. Results: In 62% total hysterectomy and in 9% subtotal hysterectomy in benign disease has been done, in 3% radical hysterectomy; myomectomy in 20%, 3% LND (pelvic and paraaortic), 2% sacrocolpopexy.

We present the outcome of a patient's case with recurrent heavily pretreated ovarian cancer which is currently under ongoing therapy with bevacizumab and metronomic cyclophosphamide in combination for 22 months.

Thus we tried to identify combinations of biomarkers that permit a reliable classification of benign and malignant ovarian diseases. Materials and methods: We measured the concentrations of 11 biomarkers in the blood sera of 133 patients with pelvic masses by Sandwich ELISA systems. The histological analyses of the resectates revealed 47 malignant and 86 benign diseases. Due to the limited sample size we restricted statistical analyses to combinations of only two biomarkers leading to 55 combinations using complete cases. To quantify the predictive power of all combinations we used the AUCs of the biomarkers and the biomarker combinations and calculated 95% confidence intervals by using casewise resampling. Results: The biomarkers that performed best in univariate analyses were CA 125 (AUC 0.944), which has already provided to be a useful marker for monitoring ovarian cancer in the clinical routine and the marker HE4 (AUC 0.897). Predictiveness of CA125 improved by combinations with HE4 (AUC 0.961) and CA 19-9 and slightly improved with mouse-galectin-1, PP1490 and CA 15-3.

Objective: Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) relapses in the majority of cases due to the growth of residual microscopic tumors. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies to extend remission are required. Compelling evidence has underlined the importance of the immune system in controlling EOC. Based on the fact that the innate immune system is essential to the function of adaptive immunity and thus to the generation of effective immune responses we sought to enhance tumor immunogenicity by activating RIG-I, an intracellular innate immune sensor of viral infection. Materials and methods: We established ascites-derived primary EOC cell cultures. EOC cells were stimulated with RIG-I ligands and effects were assessed (apoptosis, HLA antigens, cytokines and chemokines). Coculture of RIG-I-treated EOC cells with monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) as well as natural killer (NK) cells was performed and activation determined (phagocytosis, HLA and costimulatory molecules, cytokines and chemokines). Results: The targeted delivery of RIG-I agonists induced primary EOC cells to upregulate HLA-class I, and to secrete pro-inflammatory CXCL10, CCL5, IL-6, TNF-a and IFN-b. Moreover, EOC cells stimulated via RIG-I became apoptotic, and were readily phagocytosed by monocytes and MoDCs, which in turn upregulated HLAclass I/II as well as costimulatory molecules, and released CXCL10 and IFN-a.

Materials and methods: DTC were analyzed in bilateral BM-aspirates (10 ml) using density-gradient-centrifugation and immunocytochemistry, applying the anti-CK-antibody A45-B/B3. Disease-free survival (DFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated using a two-sided log-rank test.

In contrast, no IC50 score was found for 14 cell culture lines. A distinct cluster was seen in primary tumor cells, fast proliferating cell lines and slow proliferating cell lines using the principle component analysis (PCA). These clusters were also seen in paired samples of primary cancer tissue and corresponding cell culture lines. Gene expression profiles of primary OC and cell culture lines did not only differ in proliferation associated genes but also in the expression of stromal, mesenchymal and epithelial markers as well as steroid-modifying enzymes and drug-resistance-genes. Interestingly, an up regulation of drug-resistance-genes was observed in fast proliferating cell culture lines in contrast to primary tumor tissue.

Objective: In ovarian cancer cells prognostic parameters like Her2newor estrogen receptor expression in breast cancer cells are missing, but clinical and pathological features like response to platinum-based chemotherapy, histological grading or FIGO stages display a certain correlation with prognosis in ovarian cancer. Recently it was shown, that especially in ovarian cancer host immunity versus tumor cells is of importance for the course of the disease. Tumor guided immune escape mechanisms have nicely been demonstrated. One of these mechanisms is the secretion of tumor derived Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) in serum of ovarian cancer patients. MIF suppresses antitumoral responses of CD8+ T-lymphocytes and NK-cells however the clinical relevance of this mechanism still remains unclear. Materials and methods: We evaluated, whether MIF-serum levels in ovarian cancer patients correlate with clinical and pathological predictors of poor prognosis. Points of interest were responsibility to platinumbased chemotherapy, histological grading, FIGO-stages at primary diagnosis and disease free and overall survival. In addition, immunohistochemistry for CD8+ T-cell and NK-cell infiltration in the tumor stroma in tissue samples from the examined patients was performed. Results: In all examined groups high MIF levels in serum correlated with poor prognosis. Tumor stroma infiltration by antitumoral immunologic effector cells correlates with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer. It was evident, that patients with high MIF serum levels displayed significantly less numbers of tumor infiltrating effector cells. Conclusions: We feel encouraged to postulate, that the secretion of MIF in serum of ovarian cancer patients is of clinical significance based on MIF interference with antitumoral immune responses. A correlation between tumor guided MIF secretion and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer should potentially be considered. Objective: The ubiquitin-proteasome system exerts regulatory functions on crucial cellular processes such as cell cycling, differentiation, proliferation, gene transcription, apoptosis and signal transduction. Circulating 20S-proteasomes (c-proteasomes) can be detected in human serum by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays technique. Increased levels of c-proteasomes have been reported in various malignancies including ovarian cancer. We evaluated whether c-proteasomes impact upon the clinical course of ovarian cancer patients. Materials and methods: Circulating 20S-proteasomes were assessed by ELISA in the sera of 120 patients presenting with the initial diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Concentrations were measured by ELISA in blood plasma of all patients before and after (n = 68) primary treatment and 55 healthy controls. The median follow up time was 19 months. Tumor specimens of patients were immunohistochemically stained for 20S-proteasomes to evaluate associations of histopathological PSM expression with c-proteasomes. Results: The median c-proteasome concentration was higher in untreated ovarian cancer patients (457.5 ng/ml, Range: 200-12,540 ng/ml) than in healthy controls (p \\ 0.0001; 290 ng/ml, Range: 140-425 ng/ml). Following completion of primary treatment, the median c-proteasome concentration increased significantly relative to baseline (p = 0.003; 595 ng/ml, Range: 200-20,000 ng/ml). The postherapeutic proteasome concentration positively correlated with residual disease in primary surgery (p = 0.031).

Estrogen exposure is known to increase breast cancer risk and to promote breast cancer progression. Estrogen actions are mediated by estrogen receptors (ER) a and b, but also require ER-binding of specific coregulatory proteins. ERAP140, also known as NCOA7, is a nuclear receptor coactivator protein which is involved both in ERa and ERb signal transduction. Therefore, polymorphisms in ERAP140 gene might affect breast cancer susceptibility. In this genotype-phenotype association study we analyzed the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1567 located in the coding region of ERAP140 gene, which results in an amino acid exchange. We compared its frequency in 352 breast cancer patients and 346 women without any malignancy by means of an allele-specific tetra-primer PCR. After tests for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using the Fisher's exact and the v 2 test, allele frequency, allele positivity and genotype frequencies were determined. Odds Ratio (OR) was calculated using the more frequent homozygous genotypes as reference group. We could not observe any significant difference of allele or genotype frequencies between the cancer and the control group, nor between cancer subgroups. Our data clearly suggest that the ERAP140 SNP tested is not associated with breast cancer susceptibility. The role of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) as master regulator of female sexual steroid hormone synthesis arises the question if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its receptor (GnRHR) might influence breast cancer susceptibility. In this genotype-phenotype association study we examined three SNPs in the GnRHR gene and genotyped a total of 565 women, 254 women with breast cancer and 311 women without any malignancy by means of allele-specific tetra-primer-PCR. No significant differences were observed between breast cancer patients and healthy women concerning genotype, allele frequency or allele positivity.

The C allele as well as the CC genotype of SNP rs13138607 were less frequent in patients with poorly differentiated (G3) tumors than in G1 or G2 tumors or than in the control group (CC: OR: 0.49, p = 0.0208; OR: 0.68, p = 0.0377). Furthermore, women with G1 or G2 tumors more frequently carried the T-allele of SNP rs12644822 than women with G3 tumors (OR: 0.65, p = 0.039 bzw.

The relevance of these data has to be examined in further studies on a larger patient cohort. Objective: Recent clinical studies revealed that adjuvant zoledronic acid (ZA) correlates with a favorable prognosis for the patients: Not only bone metastasis but also overall metastasis was found to be reduced significantly. A surprising observation that supports the hypothesis of early micrometastases in the bone marrow followed by distant metastasis as a further (and later) event. This second step might be inhibited by bisphosphonates. The topical hypothesis of cancer stem cells suggests that dormant tumor cells in the bone marrow consists, at least partly, of stem like cells.

Objective: It is very important to detect bone loss at an early stage in women with breast cancer during endocrine therapy. In the present study biochemical markers and osteodensity measurements were compared in view of their value to detect bone changes during endocrine therapy. Materials and methods: Postmenopausal women with breast cancer were included in this study. Blood samples were taken before surgery and after one year of endocrine therapy. The serum was analysed for BAP, an enzyme involved in bone formation and for TRACP-5b (BT), an enzyme involved in bone resorption. Bone density was measured by ultrasonic method. Results: So far 22 patients could be analysed. After 1 year, 14 patients (63%) had a lower T-Score as compared to the first measurement.

The intention was to clarify whether the administration of MP in twin pregnancies and premature deliveries had a different effect on the course of labour and foetal outcome compared with the conventional use of prostaglandin and the normal population. Materials and methods: PGE2 vaginal tablets were replaced with MP in our department beginning in 2006. Thirty parameters concerning course of labour and foetal outcome were compared. In the control group the indication for induced labour was over term pregnancy or rapture of membranes [37 weeks' gestations.

Objective: This work evaluated two major documents in German obstetric health legislation: the legal maternity guideline (Mutterschafts-Richtlinie) and the antenatal health care record (Mutterpass). Our aim was to develop a comprehensive picture of the historical formation of their current editions. Materials and methods: We investigated 15 editions of the German legal maternity guidelines and its 22 amendments, as well as nine versions of the antenatal health care record and its predecessor, the ''Sprechstundenblatt.'' We developed two parallel analysis instruments, one tailored to the antenatal record and a second to the legal maternity guideline. Their main categories comprise ''development '', ''layout'' and ''content'' . The development of the German legal maternity guideline and the antenatal health care record has been analyzed according to four periods, each defined by significant events in the documents ' evolution: 1965-1973, 1974-1986, 1987-2003, 2004-2010 (Table 1) . Results: On average, the legal maternity guideline was published increasingly infrequently from the first to the third period (2.7 years first period, 4 years second, 8 years third). In contrast, the mean time interval between revisions in the fourth period was 0.9 years. The number of separately published amendments to the guideline rose during the first three periods (respectively 1, 3, 18) and fell in the fourth (8). The fourth period compares to the first, in that amendments were closely followed by guideline publications. The antenatal health care records were revised every 4.5 years on average. During the third period, an insert was added instead of publishing a new edition. This resulted in only two published antenatal records within this 16-year period. Conclusions: The development of the German legal maternity guideline and the antenatal health care record has occurred unsystematically. Addressing the historical evolution contributes to a better understanding of contemporary aspects of maternity care. Objective: Acranius acardius is characterized by a normally developed fetus and an unformed twin with retrograde blood supply, lacking a heart pump. This severe complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies occurs less than in 1:35,000 births. The higher cardiac output of the healthy twin because of the supply of the acardius increases the risk of heart failure. We present 3 cases of monochorionic diamniotic twin gestations with twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) -sequence with different outcomes. Materials and methods: The first patient was a 35 years old gravida 3 para 2 woman with spontaneously conceived twin gestation with diagnosed TRAP-sequence after missed abortion of the one twin in the 7th week of gestation. Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation was performed in the 2nd trimester. The second patient was a 30 year old woman gravida 2 para 1 who did not fulfil the requirements for laser treatment. The third patient, a 39 years old woman with pronounced uterine leiomyomas, primigravida after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was not referred to a tertiary centre. Objective: The Goldenhar Syndrome (GS), also known as Oculoauricular Dysplasia, was first described by Maurice Goldenhar in 1952. It is a congenital birth defect with an asymmetrical face due to different deformations as partially formed/absent ear and eye, dislocation of the chin and mouth. In addition the skeletal, cardiac, central nervous and renal systems can also be involved. The incidence range from 1:3000-5000. A developmental disorder of the 1st + 2nd branchial arch or a vascular disruption during morphogenesis is assumed. Materials and methods: We present a 35-years old gravidaII, paraI, who was referred due to abnormal results in the first trimester screening for trisomie21 (1:138) at 14 + 2 weeks' gestational age. Her first child has been born without any abnormalities. At this stage of pregnancy we diagnosed a vitium cordis, which was later specified as a double-outlet right ventricle (DORV), multicystic renal dysplasia and retrognathia. A amnioncetesis was performed which showed a normal karyotype (46XY). A syndromic disease was assumed. At all her visits, fetal + maternoplacetal doppler ultrasound, the fetal's development and amniotic fluid was within normal ranges. On January the 14th, a intrauterine fetal death (IFT) was diagnosed, one day later with 35 + 5 weeks' gestational age she gave birth to a dead fetus, weight 2500 g, length 45 cm, head circumference 33 cm with signs of maceration. A autopsy was performed. The most obvious findings were as following: asymmetrical face morphology with an inclined lid, hypoplastia of the mandibular, hypoplasia and dysplasia of the right ear and pre-periauricular attachments, oesophagus atresia, DORV, multicystic renal dysplasia and abnormal structure of the thoracic vertebra. Objective: There is a little information on the incidence and prevalence of Rubella Infection in Lagos/Nigeria. The risk of congenital Rubella in sero-positive pregnant women has been found to produce congenital abnormalities even in developed countries. The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence of rubella virus antibody in prepregnancy class population of men and women. Study and Design: This is a cross sectional study of men and women attending the prepregnancy class facilities in the centre. PO-Geb 03.17 Preeclampsia is associated with elevated plasma ADMA levels and severely decreased placental activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) pathway plays an important role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, and elevated ADMA levels were found in women with preeclampsia as compared to healthy pregnancies. ADMA levels are regulated by the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). We set out to study whether differences in plasma ADMA levels are mere markers of preeclampsia, or reflect pathophysiological changes in preeclamptic versus normal placenta. Further, we studied the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DDAH gene in this pathophysiology. Materials and methods: We measured plasma levels of L-arginine and ADMA by a validated LC-MS/MS method in 18 pregnant women with preeclampsia and in 28 healthy pregnant women (controls). DDAH activity was determined by measuring the degradation of (2H6)-labeled ADMA in tissue homogenates from placental biopsies in 15 women with preeclampsia and 16 controls.

To prevent and counter this condition elective epidural anesthesia is recommended. Results: We report the case of a spontaneous, VE-assisted delivery of a healthy child by a paraplegic woman without epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia is currently recommended for the delivery of paraplegic women as autonomous hyperreflexia and hypertensive crisis may be a complication for delivery. A 28 year old paraplegic GII/P0 with a history of spinomedullary trauma at Th10 presented at 38 weeks of her pregnancy for induction as scheduled according to the recommendations for women with paraplegia. The history of her current pregnancy showed no significant pathological conditions, the induction period progressed well and epidural anesthesia was planned. However, in less than 15 min the cervix had dilated from 4 to 10 cm, followed by a sudden decrease in fetal heart-rate to 50 bpm. Elective epidural anesthesia could not be administered anymore, the call was made to perform a vacuum extraction: in the course a healthy child (APGAR 7/8/9) was born with the mother in continuously stable cardio-circulatory and neuro-muscular status. More specifically, no signs of autonomous hyperreflexibility were observed during the time of delivery and during the first days. This case report shows that autonomous hyperreflexia is not always a complication for spontaneous delivery in paraplegic women. Conclusions: We report the case of a spontaneous, VE-assisted delivery by a paraplegic woman without epidural anesthesia and without development of maternal autonomous hyperreflexibility. Further research is required to identify parameters that may help to predict hyperreflexibility in paraplegic patients in order to plan for elective epidural anesthesia at an early stage of delivery.

Especially for women who are pregnant for the first time pregnancy is often related to considerable changes. Although according to DSM-IV prevalence rates of mental axis-1disorders do not generally increase during pregnancy, there are studies that found high prevalence rates of anxiety disorders during the postpartum period. The present study examined the question whether anxieties women suffer from during pregnancy have an impact on the course of childbirth and on the risk of a secondary caesarean section. It is assumed that on a physiologic level, anxiety can disturb the natural process of birth due to altered hormone levels. Moreover, anxious women might have problems to relax. Materials and methods: A sample of N = 248 women was recruited at the University of Heidelberg Women's Hospital.

While the incidence of heterozygous congenital protein C deficiency is one in 200-300 births, the homozygous state is extremely rare.

In the literature there are only a few reports published, with only one out of nine reporting upon a successful pregnancy outcome.

Objective: Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia usually manifests after the 20th week of gestation and is unpredictable in onset and progression. Early identification of the risk of developing preeclampsia would provide means for a better surveillance, and thus improve maternal and fetal outcome.

As a severe subtype of preeclampsia, HELLP-syndrome exhibits abdominal pain and typical laboratory signs in platelet count, liver enzymes and haemolysis markers. Preeclampsia is accompanied by a rise of angiogenic factors like sFlt1, which is a soluble VEGF receptor fragment and a decline of PlGF (placental growth factor) both produced by the placenta. These factor concentrations are in balanced relation in normal pregnancy. There are numerous studies about dynamics of angiogenic factor in clinical course of severe preeclampsia. Furthermore, there are hints and observations that fetal loss or termination leads to improvement of maternal condition in the case of severe earlyonset preeclampsia. Materials and methods: We report a case of a 29 year old primigravida in the 22 + 1 week presenting with signs and symptoms of an early severe HELLP-syndrome. At admission she was complaining of upper abdominal pain. Severe hypertension required urapidil i.v. medication. In addition, we report elevated liver enzymes and proteinuria of 1.5 g/24 h. Sonography showed a highly echogenic and thickened placenta. Because of the immaturity of the fetus and the severity of the disease, termination of pregnancy with fetocid was indicated. The quotient of sFlt1/PlGF was followed up very closely. Together with platelets and liver enzyme level dynamics of the named parameters are given. After fetocid, the sFlt1/PlGF ratio fell off 41% and raised again later. After expulsion of the placenta, the ratio went down to 41. Conclusions: Termination of pregnancy due to the maternal condition can be necessary in very dramatic and early-onset forms of hypertensive complication in pregnancy. Little is known about effects of fetal death on angiogenic factor concentration. Breakdown of the fetoplacental circulation leads to a partly and temporary decline of the angiogenic ratio. Removal of the placenta is needed to stop finally the production of the anti-angiogenic surge. Objective: Some drugs are known for their fetal nephrotoxicity and are therefore contraindicated during pregnancy. However for many innovative drugs only scant data exist on the effect on the fetus and on their use during pregnancy. We report on three cases of drug-induced renal insufficiency with different intrauterine course and outcome. Materials and methods: Case 1: A pregnant woman suffering from breast cancer received a neoadjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin \u00d2 ) therapy from 16 weeks onward. Fetal renal insufficiency with anhydramnios and missing visualisation of the fetal bladder developed at 21 weeks of gestation. After discontinuation of Trastuzumab and repeated weekly instillation of amniotic fluid, spontaneous resolution of fetal renal function was noted at 24 weeks. The further course of pregnancy was complicated by massive intrauterine growth restriction. After caesarean section at 32 weeks the postnatal development and the renal function were normal. Case 2 and 3 both received valsartan during pregnancy (case 2 Diovan \u00d2 , case 3 Cordinate \u00d2 ). In Case 2 fetal renal insufficiency with anhydramnios was observed at 21 weeks. After discontinuation of Valsartan spontaneous resolution of fetal renal function was noted and a healthy male neonate with normal renal function was born at term. In case 3 the Valsartantherapy was unknown to the attending physicians. At 32 weeks of gestation she presented with anhydramnios and preterm labour. The kidneys were massively enlarged and a biochemical examination of fetal cord blood confirmed terminal renal insufficiency with elevated cystatin C and beta 2 microglobulin levels. Following preterm delivery the renal function remained insufficient and the infant is requires dialysis. Conclusions: During pregnancy the application of Valsartan and Trastuzumab should be avoided if possible. In pregnancies exposed to Trastuzumab or Valsartan the treatment should be discontinued and the fetus should be closely monitored with particular attention to the amniotic fluid volume as this reflects the fetal renal function.

Gravida/Nullipara (163 cm/54 kg) and status post inferior myocardial infarction at the age of 23 with cardiovascular arrest, ventricular fibrillation and reanimation. Coronary angiography showed an occlusion of the right coronary artery, which was re-canalized by stent in the same intervention. No history of smoking or thrombembolic events in her own or family history was stated. After exclusion of thrombophile risk factors a hyperlipoproteinaemia was discovered. Among therapy with statins and Omega-3-Acidethylester normal blood fat results were achieved. Secondary prevention for coronary artery disease takes with acetylsalicylacid (ASS) 100 mg/ day and metoprolol 47.5 mg/day. After diagnosis of pregnancy medical care in our high risk pregnancy outpatient clinic took place every 4 weeks. The cardiologist performed cardiac control. Left ventricular ejection fraction was normal. Statins were dropped, Omega-3-Acidethylester, ASS 50 mg and metoprolol were continued. Cesarean in intubation narcosis was planned for 38 weeks of gestation (WOG) and anti thrombotic therapy after cesarean medication was changed to ASS 100 mg/day and low fragmented heparin after pre-deliver interdisciplinary counseling. But emergency cesarean was performed under ASS 50 mg/day at 34 weeks of gestation due to a vaginal bleeding (healthy newborn). Post caesarean course was normal, no clinical complains, ECG-variations or troponin T increasement were observed. Statin treatment was recontinued due to post partum increased maternal blood fat results, heparin discontinued. Conclusions: Pregnancy after myocardial infarction represents a risk factor. An early interdisciplinary surveillance is mandatory during the whole pregnancy. The best way of delivery is cesarean about the 38th WOG. Objective: Fibroadenomas represent the vast majority of breast pathologies in young women. 2-4% of the fibroadenomas exceeds 5 cm in size or 500 g in weight and are called giant fibroadenomas. Due to their excessive growth they are usually enucleated to clarify a malignant origin and to prevent persisting deformities of the breast. The benign giant fibroadenoma has to be differentiated from phylloides tumors which hold a malignant potential. Materials and methods: We present a 17 year old female who was pregnant in the 24th week and suffered from a giant fibroadenoma in the right breast. Besides massive and painful swelling of the breast since 8 weeks no other abnormalities were found. On clinical examination we found a mobile tumor of more than 10 cm in size with dilated veins and an erythema on the skin surface. A prior performed biopsy and ultrasound could not definitely differentiate the mass from a phylloides tumor. Because of the rapid growth and progressive deformation of the breast an enucleation was performed without complications under perioperative control of the fetal well-being by CTG and ultrasound. After pathologic examination the tumor-size was determined 13 9 12.5 9 4.5 cm with a final weight of 456 g. Histologically a fibroadenoma with signs of chronic inflammation was confirmed. The patient did well in the long-term follow up with an adequate cosmetical result. A reconstruction because of the pronounced ptosis was delayed until the end of puerperal. No affection of the newborn was noticed after delivery. Conclusions: We present a rare case of a giant fibroadenoma in a pregnant young woman. Because of the progressive structural damage of the breast immediate surgical enucleation was indicated. Safety of the fetus was provided by perioperative monitoring.

The aim of this study was to explore the differences between planned and achieved position of TVT-O. Materials and methods: TVT-O surgery was performed in 63 incontinent women. The first 29 operations were performed according to the 1/3 rule-incision starting at 1/3 of the ultrasonographically measured urethral length (standard technique for TVT placement at our department). Due to unsatisfying results, we then switched to start the incision at 1/2 of the urethral length. Ultrasonographically assessed TVT-O biomechanics showed reduced mobility of the TVT-O compared with the TVT. We changed our approach assuming that results can be improved by TVT-O placement closer to the high pressure zone.

Materials and methods: The daVinci robotic system (dVS) with a port set-up for 3 operating arms was used in all cases. Before we performed the first operations in Dresden, 2 experienced surgeons, 2 younger physicians, and 2 nurses participated in a training course at the IRCAD in Strassbourg/France for 3 days, followed by 2 days of robotic surgery under supervision at our department. Objective: Endoscopic intracorporal knotting and suture techniques demand sophisticated surgical skill. Young surgeons can be trained to perform endoscopic intracorporal techniques using dummies. This study examines whether talent or practice is more likely to predict how well an endoscopic surgeon performs endoscopic intracorporal techniques. Coexisting factors including sinistrality and myopia were sub-analysed. Materials and methods: 25 medical students participated in an endoscopic suture teaching program (ESTP). The program included two three-hour sessions of intensive training at the pelvic trainer. In the first session, each student executed three complete knots followed by one continuous suture that starts and ends with a knot. During the second session (one week later) the students completed a single knot followed by two continuous sutures (two knots). Each complete knot consists of a double knot in one direction and a single knot in the reverse direction. Each student's skill level was determined by measuring their knotting times.

There are several strategies. At first the use of autologous material like tram flap, latissimus dorsi flap or deep inferior epigastric perforator flap (diep), associated with the disadvantage of long operation durations, the risk of flap necrosis as well as scars in areas outside the breast or thorax. At second the expander/implant approach, that sometimes leads to a cranial position of implants, less natural form of the breast, dislocation of the implant and the need for a two stage procedure. A single stage reconstruction with good cosmetical outcome and no risk of flap necrosis would certainly mean progress. Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) has been popularized in other countries as an adjunct to tissue expander or implant breast reconstruction given its utility in providing additional coverage and support for the inferior pole. In Germany there is no government approval for alloderm \u00d2 (acellular cadaveric dermis) therefore other materials like acellular dermal matrix based on pig skin (Strattice \u00d2 ) have to be used. Materials and methods: We have used ADM for reconstructive surgery after radical, skin sparing or subcutaneous mastectomy. The subpectoral pocket is opened laterally at the insertion of the pectoralis muscle. The submuscular and ADM pocket is subsequently formed. The acellular dermal matrix is used to create a nice submammarian fold which helps to give the permanent prosthesis a more caudal and therefore more natural position. The tissue expander (when necessary) or permanent prosthesis is then placed in the pocket and the pectoralis muscle is connected through interrupted stitches to the ADM. Without the use of ADM lower pole expansion is rather restricted. Conclusions: Encouraged by the good cosmetic results we will further use this technique, although longer follow up is needed. Vulvar cancer is a rare disease with an incidence of 2.5/100,000 and a mortality of 1.3/100,000 patients per year, whereas squamous cell carcinomas are the vast majority. One of the most important prognostic factors in vulvar carcinoma patients is the presence of lymph node metastases. The surgical therapy of vulvar carcinoma patients includes radical local excision or a partial/complete vulvectomy accompanied by uni-or bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy depending on the tumour infiltration depth. Although complete inguinofemoral lymph node dissection is accompanied by a high morbidity, the evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of the sentinel lymph node biopsy as an alternative method with less side effects is not yet complete. In a multicenter survey, we asked gynecological surgeons of 41 hospitals about their experience with the sentinel lymph node biopsy. The majority of these surgeons are fully adapted to perform this technique in patients with vulvar carcinoma (73%, n = 30). Among our survey hospitals, 27% (n = 11) perform inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy as a standard procedure, 10% (n = 3) of them apply the sentinel lymph node technique alone, and in 63% (n = 26) of the hospitals both procedures are used in combination. Only 20% (n = 6) of the surveyed institutions apply the sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with vulvar carcinoma according to the consensus criteria/S2 guideline. Moreover, in our survey we further asked, whether the surgeons always complete the sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with vulvar cancer by complete inguinofemoral lyphadenectomy in addition: This was standard in 24% (n = 10) of the hospitals. We are planning a prospective randomised multicenter study in patients with vulvar cancer to compare the effectiveness of Objective: Screening of more than 7000 German breast and ovarian cancer families by PCR based techniques revealed mutation frequencies in the two known BRCA genes between 35-50%. In contrast, mutations in other predisposing genes like CHEK2 and ATM were detected with very low prevalence. As a still significant proportion of our families are lacking mutations in these known genes, we decided to screen them for mutations in another predisposing gene for breast cancer, called PALB2. In addition, we included sporadic cases. Materials and methods: We performed a comprehensive mutation screening of PALB2 in 818 familial and 820 sporadic cases of breast cancer from Germany. All affected index patients had been screened for small nucleotide alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 by dHPLC and/or by direct DNA-sequencing and tested negative for pathogenic mutations. Eight out of 13 PALB2 exons were analysed, covering 100% of the mutations previously reported in PALB2 positive breast cancer families. Results: We found eight truncating mutations (seven of them novel), five in 818 BRCA1/2-mutation-negative families with familial breast cancer and three in 820 sporadic cases. Moreover, three novels potentially disease causing missense mutations were found. In contrast, none of the previously published deleterious mutations found in other populations, except one, were identified. Conclusions: Our observations indicate firstly, low prevalence of deleterious PALB2 mutations and secondly, a distinct mutation profile within the German population.

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) embody over 8% of the human genome and are derived from ancestral germ line retroviral infection. Some HERV envelope (env) proteins are essential for mediating cell-cell-fusion of cytotrophoblasts to the syncytiotrophoblast in human placentogenesis, but are also implicated in tumorigenesis. Hypomethylated 5 0 Long-Terminal-Repeats (5 0 LTR) of HERVs correlating with increased expression have been shown for HERV-W and HERV-K in different human carcinomas. Previously, we demonstrated a significant step-wise increase of the Syncytin-1 HERV-W env gene at both mRNA and protein levels for EnCa and prestages compared to controls. The purpose of this study was to determine expression of five HERV envelope genes in Endometrial Carcinomas (EnCa) and correlation with CpG-methylation of the 5 0 LTR of HERV-W in EnCa and prestages compared to matched control tissues. We established methods for absolute quantification (qPCR) for five different HERV-env genes and methylation-specific-PCR (MSP) using bisulfite treated genomic DNA.

Studies using the demethylation agent 5 0 Aza-2 0 Cytidine with EnCa cell lines resulted in a 2.5-fold increase of Syncytin-1 gene expression.

Therefore identification of the LNS is important for the determination of the overall therapeutical concept. However, an appraisal of the axillary lymph node status that is solely based on clinical and/or image-based judgement would lead to an overtreatment of 40% of the patients. In order to reduce the rate of unnecessary axillary dissection (AD), a pretherapeutical interventional clarification is necessary, which provides closer information about the histological condition of the lymph node. Materials and methods: In a pilot study 27 primary breast cancer patients have been evaluated by sonographic assessment of the axillary lymph nodes' dignity, following preoperative interventional clarification by fine needle aspiration (FNA). Results: Results of the FNA and the postoperative histological staging were compared to pretherapeutical clinical/sonographical evaluation of lymph node dignity. An adequate sonographic assessment on the basis of standardized sonomorphological criteria is crucial for further interventional clarification. In 37% of cases with pN0 we could identify normal lymph nodes by FNA, although clinical nodal status presented to be suspect. Therefore an overtreatment with unnecessary rate of ADs could be avoided by preoperative clarification with FNA.

Objective: ShearWave TM Elastography (SWE) offers a new and independent method of investigating tissue characteristics. The BE1 study tested its ability to refine breast mass diagnosis with conventional BI-RADS ultrasound by adding SWE features. To evaluate specificity without reducing sensitivity. Materials and methods: Patients scheduled for a breast ultrasound were recruited to the BE1 study which was approved by the IRB of each center. B-mode-US were performed on the institution's own system and on the new system, followed by a SWE scan. 1000 lesions from 17 sites were entered. 910 had proven pathology, 90 are being followed-up. The reproducibility of SWE images and measurements was assessed on 3 consecutive acquisitions. The best three-variable model, including the BI-RADS score and 2 SWE features, was determined using multivariate regression analysis and used for reclassification. Objective: The aim of this study was the evaluation of the efficacy and clinical outcome of patients who underwent conization during pregnancy. We compared the preoperative cytological and histological results with the postoperative results. Prenatal and peripartal complications were evaluated. Materials and methods: We performed a file review and found 27 patients who underwent conization during pregnancy between 2003 and 2009. Suspect cytological or histological findings (colposcopic assisted biopsy) lead to LLETZ conization. Furthermore, the data collection contains HPV-testing, intraoperative and postoperative complications and affection of the margins. Additionally, a questionnaire was created to get further information about the mode of delivery, postpartum cytological results and procedures. Results: Three patients showed an invasive cancer, in 22 patients a CIN3 and one CIN2 lesion were found histologically. In one case the histological result could not be evaluated. 24 of 25 were tested positive for high-risk HPV DNA (13 HPV16, 1 HPV18, 1 HPV31, 1 HPV39 + 51, 1 HPV52). In 8 patients HPV could not be subtyped. No intraoperative complications were observed. One patient showed a postoperative missed abortion. In 15 patients we found positive microscopic resection margins. In 10 cases colposcopy and biopsy and in 11 cases colposcopy and conization revealed identical results, respectively. Histological results of the biopsy and the conization matched in 9 cases. All cases of cervical cancer were classified as no more than Pap IV or CIN3 before conization. Conclusions: The performance of a conization during pregnancy is important in patients where invasive cancer cannot be excluded.

Conclusions: Apart from well known proliferation markers like Ki67, CDC2 and CCK2, tumorproliferation is also represented by the upregulation of the aurora kinase pathway. The increased expression of these proteins which regulate chromosome segregation is also associated with the tumor grade and reduced progression free survival. We conclude that there is a causal correlation between incorrect chromosome segregation and carcinogenesis, whereas the question arises, whether the incorrect chromosome segregation leads to carcinogenesis or average tumor cell proliferation always gives rise to deficient chromosome segregation. Objective: Lymphedema is a major cause of morbidity following surgical treatment that involves lymph node dissection in cancer patients. However, the impact of lymph node removal on the prevalence of lower extremity lymphedema in patients with gynecological malignancies is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of such lymphedema, its relationship to the extension of lymphadenectomy, and risk factors for its occurrence. Patients with lower limb lymphedema were identified through any medical records available. Cases of lymphedema diagnosed prior to surgery or related to other causes were excluded. Results: 313 patients receiving treatment for gynecological malignancies which involved initial lymphadenectomy were evaluated. 37% of patients were diagnosed with lymphedema within 1 year after surgery. Incidence of lymphedema correlated positively with the number of lymph nodes dissected. Patients suffering from wound infections and lymphocysts had a significant increased risk to develop lymphedema.

Most commonly, the pelvic organs are involved. The manifestation of extragenital endometriosis is still rarely presented. In addition, there are just a few cases that report on the manifestations of thoracic endometriosis, defined by the presence of endometrial tissue in the lungs or pleura. Furthermore, histological findings of thoracic endometriosis with a solitary stromal component have barely been described so far. Histologically, endometriosis resembles endometrium consisting of both stroma and glands with cuboidal to cylindrical epithelium in different proportions. Materials and methods: We report an unusual case of a 38 year old female who was referred to our hospital with a medical history of recurrent pneumothoraces from 2001 to 2008 primarily caused by unknown origin. In the later histological findings thoracic endometriosis was suspected. The patient was seen by consultants from the pulmonary, thoracic surgery and obstetrics/gynecology departments. The CT scan showed a cystic transformation of the lung in both sides. Physical examinations and laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Thoracoscopic procedures with biopsy, pleurodesis and partial wedge resection of the lung were performed on both sides. The histological findings according to the morphology and the immunohistochemical expression patterns showed endometrial stroma cells. Further investigations like a hysteroscopy with fractional curettage and diagnostic pelviscopy with peritoneal and ovarian biopsies were demonstrated without detection of intraperitoneal endometriosis. Finally, in synopsis of all results a thoracic endometriosis with an isolated stromal component in the absence of epithelial cells was suspected. Differential diagnosis of this entity included benign metastasing leiomyoma and metastatic low-grade-endometrial stromal sarcoma.

Objective: Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the vagina is extremely rare. It occurs mostly in elder patients. Because of its rareness there is no evidenced based therapy. Materials and methods: We report on a 71 year old woman who had breast cancer in 1995. Five years later she was suspected to have a metastasis of the breast cancer in the vagina and so a partial colpectomy was performed. Because of a very early relapse-diagnosed by punch biopsy-after 6 months a radiation was done and the patient was treated by an antihormonal therapy. In 2007 and 2008 the patient had repeated conspicuous smears without any macroscopic lesion. A MRI scan of the pelvis showed no signs of a relapse. In June 2008 a punch biopsy was done again and the histological investigation showed a neuroendocrine carcinoma in situ of the vagina with merkel cell phenotype. Retrospectively it can be assumed that the vaginal neoplasia detected in 2000 was also a neuroendocrine tumor rather than a metastasis of the breast cancer.

Considering these pleiotropic effects on breast cancer cells, a combined treatment with genistein and trastuzumab could be a promising therapeutic approach. In this in vitro study, we tested to what extent genistein would be able to enhance the antitumoral action of trastuzumab. Materials and methods: First we characterized the HER2-, ERb1-, ERb2-, ERb5-and ERa-expression in the three breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3, BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 by real time RT-PCR. With a proliferation assay, we measured the influence of combinations of ERa-agonist (PPT), ERb-agonist (DPN) or genistein with trastuzumab on the growth of these cell lines over a time span of six days. Relevant gene changes were measured by PCR. Results: Treatment with genistein (10 lM) significantly increased the growth-inhibitory effect of trastuzumab on HER2-overexpressing, ERa/b-positive BT-474 breast cancer cells, but not on ERa-negative SK-BR-3 cells. ERb agonist DPN exerted similar effects on trastuzumab-treated BT-474 cells. In contrast, neither addition of 17-b estradiol, ERa agonist PPT nor tamoxifen did affect the antiproliferative action of trastuzumab. On the molecular level, treatment with genistein reduced HER2 transcript levels and inhibited trastuzumabtriggered upregulation of ERa-and c-fos expression. Though both drugs inhibited expression of proliferation genes Ki-67 and MYBL2, no additive effect was observed. Both drugs notably increased ERb2 transcript levels, and their combination further elevated mRNA levels of this receptor variant.

In this context, 27 intratumoral cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were quantified by multiplex analysis. Results were compared with multiple pathologic and clinical parameters and correlated to the general patients' prognosis by Adjuvant! Online calculation. Results: In 45% of patients we detected tumor-specific memory TCs in the BM. The presence of type-I memory TCs correlated significantly to primary tumors with high differentiation, estrogen receptor expression, low proliferative activity and reduced cancer mortality risk. High tumor cell differentiation correlated with increased concentrations of IFN-a and reduced levels of transforming growth factor TGFb1 in the primary tumor tissue. In 50% of patients we found tumor-specific B cell responses in the peripheral blood mainly in form of IgM isotype. Dichotomically, B cell responses correlated with increased TGFb1 and reduced IFN-a in the primary tumor tissue as well as with advanced tumor stage and the absence of TC responses in BM.

Immediate breast reconstruction allows the patient to adjust to the loss of a breast by restoring her body image. However, simultaneous reconstruction has not been widely accepted due to concerns about interference with locoregional recurrence control and possible delay in adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. A video presentation of a Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery Perforator (DIEP) Flap will serve as introduction of an approach, where all cases with local advanced breast cancer are considered for skin or nipple sparing mastectomy and simultaneous breast reconstruction. Every case has been discussed in a multidisciplinary breast team including pathologists, radiologists, gynecologists, reconstructive plastic surgeons, and medical and radiation oncologists. Special attention has been given to the main factors involved in the decision making process, such as type, stage, and location of the tumour, the necessity for adjuvant therapy, the techniques used for breast reconstruction and follow up data. All patients with local advanced invasive or in situ breast cancer, where mastectomy is indicated to obtain optimal tumour control should be considered for immediate breast reconstruction after individual multidisciplinary discussion and counselling. With an multidisciplinary approach, immediate breast reconstruction is the method of choice without loss of locoregional recurrence control or delay in adjuvant therapy in the majority of cases. Conclusions: In 25-40% with patients under age of 35 years breast cancer originates hereditary. 50% of family cases are due to hereditary breast cancer genes, BRCA1 or BRCA2, that normally go along with a worse prognosis.

So far, there exist many reports on studies about the influence of calpains in different tumors (skin, breast, renal cell or prostate cancers), but there are no studies on calpains being involved in the pathogenesis of ovarial cancer. This was the goal of this work. Materials and methods: The tissue samples consisted of 21 ovarian cancers and 15 non-cancerous tissue samples. The tissue was embedded in paraffin blocks. For representation of Calpain 1 and Calpastatin monoclonal antibodies were used, which were obtained from ascites fluid of mice. Calpain 2 has been shown with polyclonal antibodies, which were obtained from antiserum of rabbits. Results: We evaluated the correlation between enzyme expression in malign and benign ovarian tissues. In malignant ovarian tissue, we found a decreased expression, staining intensity and immunoreactive score of cilastatin. With higher grading of the ovarial carcinoma, staining intensity and immunoreactive score of Calpain 1 decreased.

Objective: Intratumoral regulatory T cells (Treg) correlate with reduced overall-survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma. Intratumoral expression of the chemokine CCL22 serves as a mechanism for the attraction of Treg to the tumor site. In the present study we investigated which cells in the tumor are responsible for the production of CCL22 and thus for the attraction of Treg.

Furthermore CCL22 levels were determined in the supernatants of different ovarian cancer cell lines. Results: We detected high levels of CCL22 in the supernatants of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In contrast, no secretion of CCL22 was observed by any of the analyzed tumor cell lines (OVCAR-3, COV18, CaoV-3, OV-1).

To inhibit caspase activity, cells were pre-treated for 45 min with a specific inhibitor of caspase 1/3 or caspase 7 (25 lM, Calbiochem). Gene and protein expression of Wnt-1 was assessed by real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence. Results: Analysis of the hormone receptor status showed the presence of estrogen-receptor-a and progesterone-receptor (PR) in MCF-7 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. In line with this observation, RU-486 significantly inhibited Wnt-1 expression only in MCF-7 cells by 98% but not in PR-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Western Blot analysis and immunofluorescence images confirmed the gene expression data. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with RU-486 diminished cell proliferation by 33% and concomitantly induced apoptosis almost 3-fold. This effect was partially blocked by the pre-treatment with the caspase 1/3 but not with the caspase 7 inhibitor. Conclusions: RU-486 profoundly inhibits the expression of the protooncogene Wnt-1 in MCF-7 cells and induces apoptosis.

As a result of the CONFIRM study, fulvestrant was approved in Europe in the 500 mg dose (2 9 250 mg injections days 0, 14, 28, then monthly) in March 2010. CONFIRM included ABC patients on 1st to 2nd line treatment. Another trial, FIRST, explored fulvestrant 500 mg against anastrozole in patients newly diagnosed with ABC. Outcomes research to evaluate the performance of therapeutic interventions in daily practice is becoming increasingly important. ACT-FASTER aims to generate data on fulvestrant 500 mg and exemestane under real-life conditions with a focus on the use of fulvestrant in different treatment lines. Materials and methods: ACT-FASTER is a prospective non-interventional cohort study sponsored by AstraZeneca that will collect clinical, epidemiological and pharmacoeconomic data on PMP patients with HR + ABC on treatment with fulvestrant 500 mg or exemestane under real-life conditions in Germany. Enrolment starts in July 2010. It is planned to include 660 patients at approx. 40 specialised clinics and 100 office-based gynaecologists or oncologists. The study has two co-primary objectives: For patients receiving fulvestrant, to compare the effectiveness in terms of time to progression as a function of line of treatment (1st-vs. 2nd-vs. 3rd-line), and for all patients, to collect and explore real-life data on epidemiology and management of all patients treated with fulvestrant or exemestane, including tumour characteristics, data on co-morbidities and treatments received. Additional effectiveness data, pharmacoeconomic data (resource use, etc) and information on health-related quality of life will also be explored for both fulvestrant and exemestane. Conclusions: ACT-FASTER aims to collect real-life data on the endocrine treatment of PMP patients with HR + ABC with a focus on the effectiveness of the newly approved dose of fulvestrant 500 mg. Additionally, data on patient management, quality of life and pharmacoeconomics will be generated.

The most common symptoms like burning, pruritus or dyspareunia are leading to a decreased quality of life. The median age of patients with breast cancer is 64 years. Most of them are postmenopausal. The majority of tumor cells express estrogen and progesterone receptors. The current treatment strategy in hormone receptor positive breast cancer is the use of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) which potentially induce or enhance the symptoms of an atrophic vaginitis. To reduce atrophic vaginitis intravaginal estradiol is a safe alternative to systemic estrogen therapy in a healthy population. However in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer on AI therapy a possible benefit of local estriol therapy is poorly understood. We therefore evaluate the local and systemic effect of vaginal application of 0.03 mg estriol (Gynoflor \u00d2 ) on atrophic vaginitis and serum estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with an nonsteroidal AI.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF33": {"text": "Conclusions: Laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy during pregnancy is feasible and safe without complications neither to mothers nor to infants.

Materials and methods: On the basis of own experiences(R\u00f6Fo 2002;  174: 1015-1017 we realised galactoscopies in clinical routine. Between 6-9/2009 we examined in the context of the assessment at 10 patients with a galactoscopy of the 2nd generation (PolyDiagnost LaduSkop \u00d2 ): for the first time exists the possibility, after implantation of an obturator (380 lm), to place an endoscopical system, which reduces the decontamination problems and simultaneously histological proof of an intraductal lesion. There exist endoscopy/fiber optical systems with outer diameter of 0.45-1.3 mm and a resolution until 30,000 pixel. Results: We examined 10 patients with a pathological (bloody) nipple discharge by cytology, sonography, galactography and the galactoscopy.

Progesterone receptor membrane component1 (PGRMC1)   is expressed in breast cancer and may be important in tumorigenesis and thus may increase breast cancer risk. The aim of this project was to investigate the influence of different progestins on MCF7 breast cancer cells overexpressing PGRMC1. Materials and methods: MCF7 cells transfected with PGRMC1 wildtype or mutants were established and incubated in RPMI/charcoal treated FCS supplemented with progesterone (P4), medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or norethisterone (NET) at concentrations from 1 nM to 10 lM and cell proliferation was measured after 4 days by MTT-assay. The same cell lines were also incubated with P4, MPA and NET at 1 lM for 6 days. The proliferation was measured daily.Results: NET increased proliferation of MCF7-PGRMC1 (WT) and MCF7-PGRMC1 (S56A/S180A) cells reaching its maximal effect of X fold proliferation compared to untreated control at a concentration of 0.1 lM. MPA increased proliferation of this cells at concentrations higher than 1 lM with a maximum at 10 lM. No effects were observed in MCF-7 cells within the investigated concentration ranges. P4 did not increase proliferation of any cell line tested within the investigated concentration ranges. Incubation of cells with MPA and NET at 1 lM for 6 days increased proliferation in all cell lines with a maximal effect in MCF7-PGRMC1(WT) cells: around 3.5 times on the 6th day compared to the untreated control. A minimal increase of proliferation was observed in MCF7 cells: around 1-1.5 times on the 6th day. Only P4 had no obvious effect on cell proliferation on any cell line.Conclusions:The effect of progestins on breast cancer tumorigenesis may depend on the specific progestin used for hormone therapy and the expression of PGRMC1. The data presented are very important in terms of the positive results of progestins and breast cancer risk in clinical studies so far. methods: It is estimated that about 18% of pain in the breast and/or the nipple within the lactation period is caused by an infection with Candida albicans. Unless women describe severe, unbearable pain during breastfeeding often lasting much longer than the sucking itself, they often do not receive adequate help.

Diagnosis of BV is based on the presence of clinical signs as well as microbiological findings. Among the many laboratory methods used for the diagnosis of BV the Gram-stain criteria as defined by Nugent et al. are currently regarded as the standard procedure. Although this method has been repeatedly refined, morphological assessment alone may not reflect the microbiologic variations among BV individuals and should be extended by molecular methods. Quite recently we have shown that the PCRbased terminal-restriction-fragment-analysis (T-RFLP) provides a reliable technique to allow differentiation of the fluid of BV and healthy women. However, for prevention early detection of clinically relevant disturbance of the vaginal flora is necessary. Materials and methods: Vaginal swabs from 163 pregnant women were analyzed by Nugent score, conventional culture and identification and T-RFLP as described previously by Thies et al.Results: According to Nugent score 18 patients had BV which was verified by T-RFLP pattern.

Therefore, reassessment of the predictive markers at the time of disease progression might help to optimize treatment decisions. Metastatic tissue may be difficult to obtain for repeated analysis. In this context, characterization of CTC could be of relevance. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was:(1)  to reevaluate the ER/PR expression by CTC and (2)to compare the hormone receptor status expression profile of CTC with the primary tumor. Most of the CTC were ER/PR-negative despite the presence of an ER/PR-positive primary tumor.

In various tumors an autocrine growth promoting loop has been described for GnRH. Our study evaluates the anti-tumor activity and mechanisms of action of AEZS 115 in models of triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). GnRH antagonist AEZS-115 showed substantial antitumor activity in TNBC cell lines by induction of apoptosis, while GnRH-agonist Triptorelin and peptidic antagonist Cetrorelix showed minor growth inhibition. This finding could be explained by atypical GnRH-receptors on tumor tissue to which the different GnRHantagonists might bind with different affinity. Both GnRH antagonists inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, which may be one, but not the only mechanism of action of GnRH antagonists. The prognostic relevance of isolated tumor cells in bone marrow has recently been proven(Braun et al.; Janni et al.)  and early data indicates a prognostic relevance of circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood(Cristofanilli et al.; Rack et al.; ASCO 2008).

Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine, Heidelberg, Germany, 2 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Ginecologia e Obstetricia, Porto Alegre, BrazilObjective: PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) is a clinically heterogeneous, endocrine disorder, which affects up to 4-10% of women in their reproductive age. A standardized definition is still difficult because of a huge variety of different phenotypes. The aim of this study was to evaluate possible correlations between the degree of cycle irregularity and the grade of endocrine and metabolic abnormalities. Materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was carried out. Hyperandrogenic and/or hirsute women with regular menstrual cycles and polycystic ovaries in ultrasound (PCOS eumenorr, n = 45), PCOS patients with oligomenorrhea (PCOS oligo, n = 42) and PCOS patients with amenorrhea (PCOS amenorr, n = 31) were recruited from the Department of Gynecological Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine Heidelberg. Results: Normocyclic patients demonstrated metabolic parameters (BMI, Fasting Insulin, HOMA-IR) significantly better than patients with oligo/amenorrhea. Hormonal parameters (LH, FSH, FAI and testosterone) were significantly different between patients with different menstrual patterns and patient with regular cycles. Conclusions: determining the degree of cycle irregularity as a simple clinical parameter might be a valuable instrument to estimate the degree of metabolic and endocrine disorders. Emphasis should be given to those parameters as a first step to characterize PCOS patients with a risk of endocrine and metabolic disorders leading to consequent detailed examination.Objective: Antiresorptive therapy (ART) with bisphosphonates (BP) is effective in reducing the risk of fractures by maintaining bone mineral density (BMD), however discontinuation and non-adherence are common in patients treated with ART. Reasons for this are discussed controversially, and little is known about the impact of noncompliance on therapy outcome. Materials and methods: In this prospective, observational study, women with an indication for BP therapy (group I) were questioned every six months about compliance/adherence, side effects, and quality of life. The patients are subdivided into two subgroups according to their underlying disease: 25 women with breast-cancer induced bone disease (BCIBD) are compared with 16 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis in whom ART was also indicated (n = 16). Bone density was measured at the beginning of the study and after 24 months using DXA scans and compared with a control group (II). Results: 103 patients were recruited. Mean baseline-age of patients in treatment was 63 years, compared to 60 years in the control group. 84 (81.6%) women had a history of BC. Patients in group I had significant lower BMD at baseline compared to group II. In group I, 12 patients had been treated with tamoxifen prior to baseline (29.3%), in group II this proportion was 22 (35.5%).14 (34,1%) women had AI therapy in group I, and 33 (53.7%) in group II. 15 women took oral BP, 13 women were on i.v. BP in group 1. So far, 3 patients stopped BP therapy, while another 3 patients discontinued BP-therapy for [6 month between the visits due to potential/ expected side effects (i.e. tooth extraction). Conclusions: Careful consideration of patients' medical history and priorities when choosing a bisphosphonate and attention to side effects plus appropriate co-medication can help to meet therapeutic goals towards preventing osteoporotic fractures.Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Frauenklinik und Poliklinik, M\u00fcnchen, Germany, 2 Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Institut f\u00fcr Radiologie, M\u00fcnchen, Germany, 3 Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Institut f\u00fcr Medizinische Statistik -IMSE, M\u00fcnchen, Germany, 4 Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Institut f\u00fcr klinische Chemie, M\u00fcnchen, Germany", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF90": {"text": "*Amadeus Hornemann 1 , Doerte W.

Materials and methods: Retrospective cohort-analysis about obstetrical data of gemini deliveries between January 2000 and December 2008 in the department of obstetrics and gynecology of the university hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus L\u00fcbeck. Results: Patients delivering gemini after assisted reproduction are staying 1.1 days longer at the hospital, are average 2.5 years older and gravidity and parity is lower compared with women after spontaneous conception of gemini. Fetal outcome (weeks of gestation, birthweight, APGAR, umbilical arterial pH, intensive care unit etc.) and other maternal data (maternal height, maternal weight, length of operation etc.) were not significant different. The 1.1 day longer hospital stay lead to about 250 Euro more costs per patient. Conclusions: Additional costs in gemini deliveries after assisted reproduction are due to longer stay at the hospital.

Materials and methods: A 32 year old primigravida was referred to our obstetrical department at 33 weeks of gestation with left-sided facial paralysis and ptosis. Laboratory findings included a thrombocyte count of 69/nl, GOT at 219 IU/l, and GPT at 183 IU/l. Besides the neurological manifestation the patient showed no other clinical signs of HELLP syndrome. Results: Caesarean section was immediately performed. A healthy boy of 1860 g was delivered and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. The patient herself clinically and chemically recovered with intravenous corticoid application, and was released from care on the 8th day after delivery. Neurological and otolaryngological examinations, as well as MRI of the neurocranium, showed no other pathologies.Conclusions: Facial nerve paralysis is a rare complication of HELLP syndrome, and can lead to full recovery when treated accordingly.College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Lagos, Nigeria, 2 College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Prenatal Diagnosis and Therapy Centreb and Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Lagos, NigeriaObjective: Neural Tube Defects is among the most common major congenital malformation World Wide.

Materials and methods: Women who gave birth and received at least one red blood cell, platelet or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion where selected from the department's database. Complete information was found for 241 cases from January 1996 to February 2007. Information was collected from the department's computer programs and completed and compared with archive data. Data was collected in regards to: demographics, type of delivery, blood loss, number and type of transfusions received, hematological lab values, patient complications, complications during and after labor, and type of anemia treatment. Results: Although we expected to see a decreasing trend in red blood cell transfusions, our results show an increasing percentage of patients receiving blood transfusions after the year 2004. Furthermore our data shows a number of FFP, platelet and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions being administered inappropriately with discrepancies in data administration. Conclusions: Educational outreach and quality assurance checks are options, which could help improve the acknowledgment, understanding and administration of the practice of blood product transfusion at the University of Zurich Hospital.Frauen\u00e4rztliche Gemeinschaftspraxis, Offenburg, GermanyObjective: We present the rare case of a patient with a fetal intraabdominal umbilical vein varix and a possible explanation for the development of the varix. Materials and methods: The patient, a 41 year-old IVg/Ip was diagnosed at 32 weeks of gestation with an intraabdominal varix of the umbilical vein as a sign of a presumptive stenosis of the umbilical part of the vein. Further ultrasonic evaluation showed no other irregularities. Amniocentesis had been performed in the first trimester because of a history of trisomy 13 with normal results. In color Doppler ultrasound there was normal blood flow in both the middle cerebral and the umbilical artery. Blood flow was normal in the periumbilical portion of the umbilical vein and in the ductus venosus. The intraabdominal part of the umbilical vein showed varicose dilation up to 12 mm over a distance of 22 mm. Blood flow velocity in this part of the vein was elevated to 85 cm/s. Due to the risk of intrauterine fetal death primary cesarean section was performed at 36 weeks of pregnancy. Results: The neonate was a healthy female, weight 2640 g, APGAR score 9/10/10. There were no further malformations. Conclusions: A fetal intra-abdominal umbilical vein varix is a rare condition in pregnancy. A possible explanation for the dilation of the poststenotic vessel is the high velocity of blood flow in the low pressure area, caused by a jet phenomenon. The degree of poststenotic widening of the vein may be due to the decrease of pressure from the jet. Conducting a survey of literature the risks for the fetuses are found to vary strongly. When a FIUV varix is diagnosed in pregnancy, frequent controls of the baby's well-being are essential in order to prevent intrauterine fetal death. The varix can be detected on routine sonography.*Nicola Hart 1 , Christine Morfeld 1 , Christina Krautter 1 , Sandy Liem 1 , Jens Siegel 2 , Ralf L. Schild 1 Henriettenstiftung, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hannover, Germany, 2 Henriettenstiftung Hannover, Department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Hannover, GermanyObjective: Midgut volvulus is a condition in which the small bowel or proximal colon twist around the superior mesenteric artery. This condition most commonly presents during the first year of life and is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Midgut volvulus without malrotation is an extremely rare surgical condition which may also occur during intrauterine life. Most cases of volvulus are associated with intestinal malrotation or other congenital anomalies. Dilated bowel loops on prenatal ultrasound may be an indicator of this anomaly. In these cases close monitoring of the fetal condition is mandatory to tailor the appropriate treatment.Materials and methods:A 25 year-old pregnant woman was referred to our hospital at 33 weeks of gestation with reduced fetal movements and onset of preterm labour. Ultrasound examination revealed a dilated intestine but no other fetal abnormalities. Intrauterine volvulus was suspected. Fetal biometry and Doppler measurements were appropriate for gestational age. Within two days of admission, however, fetal Doppler indices and gross fetal movements deteriorated, cardiotocography became abnormal and fetal ascites developed. A 1940-g male was delivered by Cesarean section. Neonatal examination showed a tense, distended abdomen. Laparotomy was performed at 6 h of age, during which the suspected volvulus was confirmed. A de-torsion and segmental bowel resection were performed. Conclusions: Prenatal diagnosis of a volvulus requires close monitoring in a prenatal care center and immediate post partum intervention to ensure optimal Objective: To evaluate the impact of maternal obesity on labour, intrapartual assessment, delivery and fetal outcome. Materials and methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of n = 11.681 deliveries supervised between1.01.2000 and 31.12.2009. Results were analyzed dividing the patients in 2 main groups according their BMI: group 1, control: BMI 18-24.9 and group 2 BMI, test [25. III) BMI [ 40. Exclusion criteria were defined: delivery \\37 + 0 weeks p.m., multiple pregnancy, comorbidity other than GDM, abnormal presentation, BMI \\ 18.5, incomplete data. Main outcome parameter was defined: mode of delivery, maternal injury and fetal outcome (arterial cord ph, APGAR score, birth weight). Results: n = 8.379 patients met the inclusion criteria and were divided in two groups: (1) N = 4.464 patients and (2) n = 3.915. Basic maternal characteristics including fetal vital parameters were equal in all groups. GDM occurred more frequently in obese patients (P \\ 0.001). Concerning the main outcome parameters a significant decrease in the rate of spontaneous delivery between control (71.97-65.95%, \\0.001) and test groups (71.97% vs. 50.27%, \\0.001) could be observed. The rate of secondary c-section increased significantly according to higher BMI ([40: OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.841-3.611, 92 P \\ 0.001). The groups showed no difference in the rate of injuries during delivery though fetal birth weight increased significantly with higher BMI (3412-3681 g, P \\ 0.001). Conclusions: Obesity decreases the chance to deliver spontaneously. Moreover, the obese patient suffers from a significant longer trial of labour (7.89 vs 9.52 h) and elevated risk of surgical delivery.PO-Geb 02.33 Does gender of the supportive companion during labor influence delivery outcome: a retrospective cohort study *Eva-Katrin Tempfer-Bentz 1 , Elke Hinterkirchner 1 , Yao Gong 1University of Vienna, OBGYN, Vienna, AustriaObjective: Previous retrospective and prospective controlled studies demonstrated positive effects of a continuous presence of a supportive companion with respect to length of labor, type of delivery, and need of epidural analgesia.

Despite of promising results, complications remains high. We describe laparoscopic approaches for ''active'' women to prevent mesh caused complaints (i.e. erosions, dyspareunia). The indications for laparoscopic paravaginal repair and colposuspension is the same as in open surgery (paravaginal defect, stress incontinence). Materials and methods: We perform the approaches as routine laparoscopy. For paravaginal repair and colposuspension peritoneal incision is made on the pelvic sidewall, retroperitoneum is opened and obliterated umbilical ligament is visualized, isolated and pushed medially. The paravesical space is opened. Pubic ramus, Cooper's ligament and arcus tendinous fascia pelvis are visualized. The anterior vagina is identified and cleared from fatty tissue. If paravaginal wall defects are present, lateral margins of the detached pubocervical fascia and the broken edge of arcus tendinous can be visualized.

Differences in biomechanics (except for the less acute angle of the TVT-O) between both tapes are well known. This study evaluated TVT-O biomechanics by ultrasound to identify possible reasons for failure.Materials and methods: TVT-O surgery was performed in 63 incontinent women. The first 29 operations were performed according to the 1/3 rule-incision starting at 1/3 of the ultrasonographically measured urethral length (standard TVT placement technique at our departments). Due to unsatisfying results, we then switched to start the incision at 1/2 of the urethral length, hypothesizing that better results should be achieved with the tape placed closer to the high pressure zone. Ultrasonographically assessed TVT-O biomechanics showed reduced tape mobility during straining compared with TVT. Pelvic floor ultrasound was performed using a 5-9 MHz vaginal probe. The parameters explored included urethral length, linear urethral dorsocaudal movement (LUDM), longitudinal urethral tape localization (LUTL), and distance between hypoechoic urethra and tape (DHUT). Success was assessed 6 months after surgery. For this analysis patients were divided into 2 groups: cured versus not cured. Results: TVT-O placement according to the 1/3 rule showed 34.5% failures versus 11.8% according to the 1/2 rule. Low urethral mobility and high fixation of the urethra negatively affected the cure result. DHUT [5 mm also had negative impact on continence. We found no correlation between maximal urethral closure pressure (MUCP) B20 cm H 2 O and cure rate. Conclusions: To obtain similar results as with TVT, the incision for TVT-O placement should be started according to the 1/2 rule. Women with a less mobile urethra and high urethral fixation have a higher risk of TVT-O failure.PO-Gyn 03.12 The use of the single port system for benign adnexial surgery: a pilot study *Felix Neis 1 , Bernd Holthaus 1Krankenhaus St. Elisabeth, Gynecology and Obstetrics, Damme, GermanyObjective: The Laparo-Endoscopic Single-Site (LESS) surgery is a technique, which only needs a single incision in the umbilicus to perform an operative laparoscopy. There is no need for further incisions for working trocars. The aim was to evaluate the indications, the options and the limitations of the LESS surgery. Materials and methods: 25 patients with benign adnexial tumors were treated with this operative technique and the data was analyzed. Results: All surgeries were performed in an analog way as in the conventional minimal invasive surgery (MIS). Neither additional incisions nor a conversion to a laparotomy was necessary. The use of the instruments, which were built especially for this technique, is easy to learn. Because of this the duration of the surgery is not extended. Conclusions: The LESS surgery is a technically feasible and save procedure with a very good cosmetic outcome. It is, in the adnexial surgery, an alternative solution to the conventional MIS. To make a final statement, the other indications for the LESS surgery, have to be verified.intermediate-term outcome after laparoscopic sacropexy with regard to complication rate, reprolapse rate and patient's contentedness.

There are few reports in combination with gynecologic surgery. Materials and methods: A 38 year old underwent extended surgery for a malignant yolk sac tumor of the ovary. The operating time was 6 h, anesthesia time and time in lithotomy position almost 7 h. On the first postoperative day the patient reported pain and swelling in the lower left leg and ACS was diagnosed. An immediate fasciotomy with necrectomy of the soleus muscle was performed. The patient subsequently required repeated debridements on the 4th and 6th postoperative days. Five months postoperatively, after physical therapy, the patient was well and mobile but foot drop persisted. Conclusions: ACS is a clinical diagnosis confirmed by laboratory findings. It is well known to trauma and plastic surgeons, but the wellleg variant is rare and may not be familiar to gynaecologic surgeons.

The aims of subcutaneous mastectomy are removal of the breast tissue and excess skin as well as the adequate positioning and sizing of the nipple-areola complex. For a good cosmetic outcome scars are to be minimized. Materials and methods: From January 2005 to March 2010, a total of 50 subcutaneous mastectomies were performed in 25 female-to-male transsexuals. The technique used depended on the breast size, the skin elasticity, and the position of the nipple-areola complex. The concentric circular technique (19 of 25, 76%) was used for small to medium-sized breasts, the free nipple graft technique (6 of 25, 24%) for large-volume breasts. A retrospective review of patient charts was undertaken, and a questionnaire was used to rate the overall aesthetic result of the subcutaneous mastectomy. Results: The overall postoperative complication rate was 12.0% (6 of 50 subcutaneous mastectomies), and in 4 of these patients (16.0%), an additional operative intervention was required because of hematoma, wound dehiscence, and/or partial necrosis of the nipple-areola complex. Additional procedures for improving aesthetic results (e.g. wrinkling) were performed on 2 patients (8.0%). The highest patient satisfaction rating was found among the concentric circular group. Conclusions: We introduced two operative procedures for subcutaneous mastectomy in FTMTS. Skin excess and skin elasticity are the key factors in choosing the appropriate technique. For breasts with small to moderate breast size the concentric circular technique is suitable, whereas large-volume breasts will likely require the free nipple graft technique. There is a high rate of overall satisfaction as well as a low rate of postoperative complications.PO-Geb 03.21Comparison of a reusable with a disposable vessel sealing device in a sheep model: efficacy and cost analysis PO-Onko 03.02 Germline mutations in the PALB2 gene are population specific and occur with low frequencies in familial and sporadic breast cancer *Eva Gross 1 , Heide Hellebrand 1 , Christian Sutter 2 , Barbara Wappenschmidt 3 , Helmut Dei\u00dfler 4 , Marion Kiechle 1 , Rita Schmutzler 3 , Dieter Niederacher 5 , Norbert Arnold 6 , Alfons Meindl 1 Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Munich, Germany, 2 University of Heidelberg, Institute of Human Genetics, Heidelberg, Germany, 3 University of K\u00f6ln,Obstetrics  and Gynaecology, K\u00f6ln, Germany, 4  University of Ulm, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Ulm, Germany, 5 Heinrich Heine University, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, 6 University of Kiel, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Kiel, Germany", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF237": {"text": "*Almut Artmann 1 , Nina Bo\u00a8hm 1 , Irina La\u00a8mmer-Skarke 1 , Janna Krol 2 , Volker R.

Target-aimed hospital controlling means being aware of clinic-individual costs of every last medical procedure in addition to optimized coding. Issuing cost-coverage for bilateral, subcutaneous and nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate breast-reconstruction in case of BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene mutation carriers, a comparison of costs and proceeds has been made.Materials and methods: Restriction of the main diagnosis Z80.3 and Z40.00 and according OPS-codes (ICPM) 870.0, 872.1, 876.2 and 876.3 in 2009.

Furthermore comparison of generated revenues for DRGs J24B and Z01Z.Results: The costs for a prophylactic mastectomy add up to 4,093.93 \u20ac in total for each in-patient treated. Deficient cost-coverage of 1,707.84\u20ac/case (=41.72%) in the event of assignment to DRG Z01Z. At analogical expended effort and cost-structure, the cost-coverage of DRG J24B averages 95.76%, which equals a difference of 1,534.22 \u20ac in reimbursement for same effort and expenses on the part of the clinic. Conclusions: The variation in refunds do not seem reasonable. According to the German coding-guideline, a subcutaneous mastectomy requires coding in Z80. A skin-sparing mastectomy does not equal a subcutaneous mastectomy though and needs to be sharply divided also in regard of the OP-documentation by the medical staff.In case of skin-sparing mastectomy (OPS 5-872.-) due to high risk of familial breast cancer, an assignment to ICD-Code Z40 is strictly recommended in order to gain appropriate reimbursement for actual costs.PO-Onko 03.05 Influence of breast cancer on sexuality *Christine Julia Dittmer 1 , Kathrin Roeder 1 , Marc Thill 1 , Dorothea Fischer 1 University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus L\u00fcbeck, Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, L\u00fcbeck, GermanyObjective: We examine the sexuality of women who have received treatment for breast cancer.

Tumor characteristics are relevant in prognosis and treatment of breast cancer and potentially strongly associated with the body mass index. Materials and methods: The ADEBAR study is a german multicenter phase III trial (n = 1502) with the goal to evaluate whether breast cancer (BC) pts with [ 3 axillary lymph node metastases benefit from a sequential anthracycline-docetaxel regimen (EC-Doc) compared to dose-intensive anthracycline-containing polychemotherapy (FEC). For our evaluation Adebar-Patients were grouped according the WHO global database on body mass index (BMI). Results: There is a strong correlation between BMI, age and menopausal status at clinical diagnosis of breast cancer. This analysis shows no connection of tumor localisation (unilateral left or right and bilateral breast cancer) and BMI. The tumor size at clinical diagnosis was strongly associated to the patient's weight (\\0.0001). In underweight, normal, overweight as well obese patients there was no sign for a significant difference in the number of positive lymph nodes (p = 0.2890), tumor histology (p = 0.9750) and grading (p = 0.9520). Breast Cancer Positivity for ER and PR hormone receptors (ER p = 0.9708, PR p = 0.7785) and the expression of HER-2 at the tumor surface (p = 0.1710) were not significant associated to overweight and obesity in study patients. Conclusions: Our analysis shows a highly significant coherence between BMI and tumor size in patients with early stage node positive breast cancer. This finding is in line with current publications which show that overweight and obese woman's have often been diagnosed at a more advanced stage of disease and the treatment in this patients being less effective as a consequence. Weight reduction might be an additional approach on breast cancer therapy and prevention.PO-Onko 03.07 Assessing the efficacy of targeted therapy using Circulating Epithelial Tumor Cells (CETC): the example of SERM therapy monitoring as a unique tool to individualize therapy*Katharina Pachmann 1 , Oumar Camara 2 , Annika Kohlhase 1 , Carola Rabenstein 3 , Torsten Kroll 1 , Ingo B.

Furthermore, the grade of satisfaction with IORT of patients and physicians has been investigated. Materials and methods: Patients for IORT were carefully selected. Only patients with unifocal, ductal-invasive breast cancer, without a DCIS-component in the preoperative core biopsy were considered for IORT treatment. This retrospective study included all consecutive patients who underwent IORT in our hospital from 5/2009 till 4/2010 and is based on a voluntary questionnaire. The same questionnaire was also given to the treating physicians of the patients. Main outcome parameters were reasons for decision to undergo IORT and satisfaction with this new method. Data analysis was conducted with SPSS. Results: The main reasons for patients and physician to decide on IORT are different. Saving time is a very important reason for patients, whereas for physicians, local tumour control plays a decisive role. Further it is demonstrated that IORT is well accepted both by patients and physicians.Conclusions: Both patients and physicians are satisfied with IORT (intrabeam \u00d2 ), the estimation of benefits differs.

The present online study aims at assessing working conditions and subjective satisfaction of assistant doctors in gynecologic training.Materials and methods: Residents from 62 German hospitals were invited via email to participate in an online survey. The anonymous questionnaire included demographic data and information on the curriculum of training as well as different aspects of subjective satisfaction with the training. Results: Of the 424 doctors contacted, 186 responded from 48 hospitals in the online questionnaire. Respondents were mainly dissatisfied with the instruction for the first operations and with the limited availability of time to practice. The satisfaction of training related to the satisfaction preparation before the first surgery and an opposite relation to the average training necessary for specialisation. The feedback from medical colleagues and superiors or rather the availability of mentors had also an effect on the training satisfaction.Conclusions:The results indicate that physicians in gynecologic education want in particular more technical expertise and more time in practical training. The results of the study can contribute to the evaluation of the quality of gynecologic training.Marienhospital Bottrop, Klinik f\u00fcr Gyn\u00e4kologie und Geburtshilfe, Bottrop, Germany, 2 Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Essen, Institut f\u00fcr Pathologie und Neuropathologie, Essen, Germany", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF243": {"text": "The histology of necrosis with giant cell granulomatous infection with a negative Ziehl-Neelsen-reaction and the exclusion of a malignant disease raised the suspicion of culture negative breast tuberculosis.

Female and male students from 5 universities in Switzerland were included in this cross-sectional survey conducted 2008 prior to the introduction of the HPV vaccine program. Results: Out of total 3728 female and 1380 male participants responding to the survey, 48.3 and 39.9%, respectively, had previously heard about HPV. 33.8% of the female and 28.7% of male participants indicated to have a good knowledge, 17.9 and 31.4%, respectively, indicated to have never heard of HPV. Participants achieving high HPV-knowledge scores reported the gynaecologist (MS: 14.53, SD 2.90), the general practitioner (MS: 14.43, SD 2.78) and press/media (MS: 14.20, SD 3.12) as main source of knowledge, whereas family (MS: 12.93, SD 2.8) and friends as sources achieved significantly lower scores (MS: 13.25 SD 2.59, p \\ 0.0001). Women with past history of abnormal smear or HPV infection achieved higher HPV knowledge scores (MS: 14.87; SD: 3.01). The knowledge on cervical cancer (MS 6.51, SD: 3.78), HPV-testing (MS: 1.79, SD: 0.40) and HPV-vaccination (MS: 4.21, SD 1.94) was better among women compared to men (all p \\ 0.05). 52.9% of the participants would accept vaccination for themselves, whereas 30.6% were not sure and 12.9% refused vaccination. At the time of survey 3.7% were already vaccinated. Conclusions: Although almost half of Swiss students had already heard about HPV, accurate knowledge was not high. Information obtained through gynaecological visits and general practitioners leaded to significantly better HPV education, which underlines the importance for careful medical education and counselling of patients in daily clinical practice.PO-Onko 03.14 64 year old women with ovarian cancer and a cutaneous involvement of the vulva *Beate Seemann 1 , Katharina Hancke 1 , Rolf Kreienberg 1Gynecology, University Hospital, Ulm, GermanyObjective: Ovarian cancer is one of the cancer diseases with the highest mortality rate. The 5 year over all survival is approximately 30% and the diagnosis is often determined in an advanced stage. Although aggressive cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy have contributed to improved local tumor control and prolonged survival, these therapeutic measures have limited success in preventing the development in distant metastases. Cutaneous involvement of ovarian carcinoma is unusual. Although the intraperitoneal route is considered the most common way of dissemination, ovarian cancer may also metastasize through the lymphatic channels and the hematogenous route. Distant metastases may occur at the time of ovarian cancer diagnosis or can arise during the evolution of the disease. Ovarian cancer rarely metastasizes to the vagina or vulva. Materials and methods: We present a 64 year-old women who had applied adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and taxol following cytoreductive surgery because of a stage 3C ovarian cancer in the year 2004. Several relapses like a progress of the lymphatic deposits occur in the period from 2006 until 2009. Therefore a long period of treatment with several chemotherapies followed. A supraclavicular lymph node metastasis and a metastatic deposit in the vulva were detected in the year 2009. A punch biopsy verified the histology of an ovarian cancer. Finally she died in the same year in a very poor condition after radiotherapy of the vulva which could not repress the proliferation. Conclusions: Our case shows that after a long period of effective surgery and different types of chemotherapeutic treatment a skin metastasis of the vulva is very difficult to treat and repress.PO-Onko 03.15 Dissiminated, genito-peritoneal tuberculosis mimicking advanced ovarian cancer.

To establish more sensitivity for genital tuberculosis as a differential diagnosis to advanced stage ovarian cancer. Showing diagnostic procedures to identify the characteristic features and the treatment of choice. Materials and methods: Case report about a 41 year old, postmenopausal Philippine woman presenting massive ascites and elevated CA125 levels who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy for ovarian cancer and found to have genito-peritoneal tuberculosis. Results: Despite similarities in clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings, a genito-peritoneal tuberculosis may not be confused with advanced ovarian cancer. Bleeding disorders and the patients country of origin can substantiate suspicion. Tissue samples confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of choice is multiple antibiotic therapy. Conclusions: Peritoneal tuberculosis with abdomino-pelvic mass is difficult to differentiate from ovarian cancer. Abdomino-pelvic tuberculosis should be considered in all cases with pelvic mass, ascites and high levels of CA125, although clinical features and laboratory results specifically indicate neither ovarian malignancy nor abdomino-pelvic tuberculosis. Bleeding disorders such as early menopause, infertility and specific countries of origin can substantiate suspicion. Diagnostic laparoscopy as well as laparotomy is a direct and safe method for taking tissue samples. Antitubercular drugs are the treatment of choice and complete surgery being difficult and hazardous should be avoided.PO-Onko 03.16 Granular-cell tumour of female breast: a rarity *Beate Richter 1 , Regine Rathmann 2 , Maren Krohn 3 , Peter Landwehr 4 , Klaus Richter 1 Pathologie Hannover Zentrum, Hannover, Germany,", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF244": {"text": "The triad: patient age, touch detectable, compact nodes with localization in the upper (inner) quadrant, no microcalcification, can be a vague indication of a benign granular-cell tumour. *Sarah Kristin Weber 1 , Axel Sauerwald 1 , Martin Po\u00a8lcher 1 , Michael Braun 1 , Manuel Debald 1 , Nuran Serge 1 , Walter Kuhn 1 , Christian Rudlowski 1 University Hospital Bonn, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Bonn, GermanyObjective: Lymph node involvement plays a major role in the spread of endometrial cancer and predicts prognosis. In tumors convined to the uterus lymph node metastasis is observed in up to 30%. For clinical application evaluation of lymph vessel invasion (LVI) as marker for lymph node metastasis is of important value. D2-40, a monoclonal immunohistochemical marker might be able to increase the detection rate of LVI compared to conventional Haematoxylin-Eosin (H.E.) staining. The aim of the study was to evaluate the eligibility of D2-40 for the prediction of lymph node metastases. Materials and methods: Immunohistochemical staining with D2-40 was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 182 patients with endometrioid adenocarinoma. Slides were screened for the presence of lymphatic vessel invasion. Correlation with clinicopathological features including LVI as retrieved by routine haematoxylin and eosin (H.E.) stained sections was assessed. Treatment modalities and patients follow-up were available. Results: Immunostaining with D2-40 significantly (p = 0.001) increased the frequency of detection of lymphatic invasion compared to conventional H.E. staining. LVI was identified by D2-40 (D2-40-LVI+) in 53/182 (29.1%) of tumor specimen as compared to 34/182 (18.3%) by routine HE staining (H.E. + LVI). D2-40-LVI+ in tumor tissue was detectable in 90% of the nodal positive tumors and (p = 0.001) predicted significantly lymph node metastases. Furthermore, D2-40 was the only independent prognostic factor for patients overall survival (p \\ 0.01) considering tumor stage, lymph node involvement, H.E.-LVI and tumor differentiation. Conclusions: Immunostaining with D2-40 significantly increased the frequency of detection of lymphatic invasion compared to conventional H.E. staining in endometrial cancer. D2-40 + LVI was a strong predictor for lymph node metastases and a prognostic relevant parameter. Further studies on large patients group a required to evaluate the clinical role of D2-40 + LVI in endometrial cancer. These studies have to be focused on patients in which lymph node dissection could be omitted without worsening patients outcome.

Materials and methods: The Brief Profile of Female Sexual Function (B-PFSF) score was used to evaluate postoperative prevalence of HSDD in women after different hysterectomy procedures. The questionnaire was sent to 590 women who had undergone a hysterectomy between 2002 and 2007 for benign conditions at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University Hospital of Erlangen. The following procedures were performed during the study time: abdominal hysterectomy (AH), vaginal hysterectomy (VH), laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH), laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LASH) and total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). Results: 304 questionnaires were returned and 258 were adequate answered to be used for statistical analysis. The mean follow-up interval was 2 years for women after LASH and TLH and 3 years for women after AH, VH, and LAVH. The women of the AH group were significant older than women of the LASH group and women of the VH group were significant older than women of the LASH or TLH group. The mean B-PFSF score was 24.4 in women after LASH, 23.3 in women after TLH, 22.5 in women after LAVH, 22.2 in women after VH and 21.1 in women after AH. The differences were statistically not different between the five groups. Conclusions: Women after LASH showed the highest B-PFSF score in comparison with women after other hysterectomy procedures. However this difference was statistically not significant. Using the B-PFSF there were no differences in prevalence of HSDD after hysterectomy, irrespective of the used surgical technique.PO-Onko 03.28 Is there a time for a structured residency training in obstetrics and gynecology in Germany?*Michaela Stumpf 1 , Maximilian Klar 1 , Gerald Gitsch 1 , Michael Runge 1 , Martha Foeldi 1Universit\u00e4ts-Frauenklinik, Freiburg, GermanyObjective: The learning aims of German residents in Obstetrics and Gynaecology are well defined by the German medical association and specified in a mandatory logbook. However, structured training programs have not been established, leading to a heterogeneous variety in quality and quantity of residency training. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of a structured perennial postgraduate training program in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Materials and methods: A structured 3-year residency training program with theoretical and practical courses in Obstetrics and Gynaecology was inaugurated in 2006. Courses were held on a weekly basis. Acquired knowledge was assessed by written tests.Evaluations of the quality of the course were obtained on a weekly basis. At the end of the 3-year program a questionnaire was administered to the residents to obtain the overall impression.Questions were asked about the impact of the program on their working satisfaction, motivation, gain of knowledge and skills. Moreover the feasibility of the program in a university hospital setting was assessed. Results: Residents participating in a structured residency training program in Obstetrics and Gynaecology felt better prepared for daily clinical work. The improvement of knowledge enhanced the working motivation and was incentive to participate at the courses. Lack of time was the most common reason for non-attendance. Conclusions: Structured residency training is feasible in a German university setting to improve work satisfaction and knowledge among residents. Yet, a shortage of staff due to the workload makes regular attendance difficult. So, is there a time for a structured residency training program?PO-Onko 03.29 QuaSiMa: optimization of quality management at certified and not-yet-certified breast centres and an introduction to the Senopedia.org knowledge base: preliminary results from a health services research study Heidelberg University Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Heidelberg, Germany, 2 T\u00fcbingen University Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, T\u00fcbingen, Germany", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF250": {"text": "*Kristina Heidner 1 , Stefan B.

TNBC are associated with a poor prognosis and limited therapy options. In this study we evaluated in vivo the effect of GHRH-Antagonist JMR-132 in combination with Avastin on tumour growth inhibition in the triple negative doxorubicin resistant human breast cancer cell line MX1. Materials and methods: The mRNA expression of pGHRH-R and the splice variant SV1 was detected by RT-PCR. For proliferation Assays cells were treated with different concentrations of JMR-132 and cell viability was assessed after 72 h using an MTS proliferation assay. For in vivo experiments MX1 tumours were xenotransplanted subcutaneously into nude mice. The animals were randomized into 4 groups receiving solvent only (Control), JMR-132 (10 mg/day s.c.), Avastin (10 mg/kg i.p. twice weekly) or the combination of both substances, respectively. Results: The cell line MX1 expressed the pGHRH-R and the splice variant SV1. In the proliferation assays JMR-132 showed a significant inhibition of cell viability compared to control. In the in vivo experiment JMR-132 and Avastin showed a significant inhibition of tumour growth compared to control. The combination of JMR-132 and Avastin showed a significant tumour growth inhibition compared to all other groups. Conclusions: The GHRH-Antagonist JMR-132 demonstrated an effective tumour growth inhibition in TNBC. This effect was increased in the combination with Avastin and represents a potential chemotherapy free treatment option for triple negative breast cancers.PO-Onko 03.33 Aesthetic and functional outcome after breast conserving therapy: development and interaction with quality of life over time*Jo\u00a8rg Heil 1 , Elena Czink 1 , Michael Golatta 1 , Annette Maleika 1 , Geraldine Rauch 2 , Gerhard Gebauer 3 , Christof Sohn 1 Heidelberg University Women's Hospital, Breast Center, Heidelberg, Germany, 2 Institute for Medical Biometry and Informatics, Department of Medical Biometry, Heidelberg, Germany, 3 Marienkrankenhaus, Department of Gynecooncology, Hamburg, GermanyObjective: Functional and aesthetic outcome after breast cancer surgery are important correlates of the patient's quality of life. Therefore the interaction and development of functional and aesthetic outcome and overall quality of life over time is of special interest. Material and methods: This prospective cohort study examines the correlation between the functional and aesthetic outcome with the quality of life and addresses the influence of the time of assessment. 138 patients treated with breast conserving surgery at the Heidelberg Breast Unit were included. The patients answered the BCTOS (Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale) and the EORTC C30-BR23 questionnaires postoperatively and one year after surgery to measure function, aesthetics and breast sensitivity as well as overall and specific dimensions of quality of life.Results:The results indicate that functional and aesthetic outcome keep an equally strong impact on overall quality of life over the course of time. Spaerman's Rho was 0.28 shortly and 0.45 one year after surgery for the interaction of functional and global health status and 0.36 and 0.32 for aesthetic and global health status, respectively. We observed the functional and aesthetic status to stay relatively stable on temporal progress with score means 1.38 shortly and 1.38 one year after surgery for the functional status and 1.82 versus 1.90 for the aesthetic status respectively. However, the breast sensitivity status improved with time (2.10 shortly versus 1.84 one year after surgery; p \\ 0.0001) and tend to be stronger correlated to the global health status postoperatively than on the one year follow-up control (Spaerman's Rho = 0.4 shortly and 0.28 one year after surgery, p = 0.29). Conclusions: Breast sensitivity is an increasingly important prognostic factor for quality of life with respect to temporal progress. Functional and aesthetic results do not change significantly within one year but remain important covariates.Objective: Therapeutic antibodies gain more and more importance in cancer treatment. Tumor specific Mucin 1 is expressed in squamous cell carcinomas, but not in normal adult tissue. Beside its carrier function for onco-fetal carbohydrates Mucin 1 acts as a membrane receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell adhesion and signal transduction. The anti-Mucin 1 antibody PankoMab only ligates tumor specific and active Mucin 1.Materials and methods: The breast carcinoma cell lines MCF7, T47D, CAMA, MDA-MB-435, ZR75-1 and MDA-MB-231 were incubated in 96-well plates and in chamber slides with increasing concentrations of the PankoMab for 48 h. Proliferation was determined by a BrdUuptake. Rates of apoptosis were defined by immunohistochemistry with the M30-antibody in the early phase and by nick-translation in the late phase. Every cell line without antibody incubation served as reference. Each approach was done five times. Results: The cell lines MCF7, T47D, CAMA, MDA-MB-435 showed decreasing proliferation rates by increasing antibody concentrations. The lines ZR75-1 and MDA-MB-231 remained unimpressed. Apoptosis was induced in antibody treated cells of the cell lines MCF7, CAMA-1 and T74D.Conclusions: In vitro the anti Mucin 1-antibody PankoMab is able to inhibit proliferation and to induce apoptosis of different breast carcinoma cell lines according to antibody concentration. Because Mucin-1 is a qualified tumor specific target and because PankoMab only binds tumor specific and membrane bound Mucin 1, we suppose an entry in a new antibody based therapy for patients with breast carcinoma.The acceptance of p.o. compared to i.v. chemotherapy is not clearly evaluated. The aim of this survey was to study the reasons why patients would decide for a p.o. treatment and to objectify their individual attitudes to oral therapy. Materials and methods: A specific questionnaire with 14 items was designed. Patients under a newly launched p.o. or i.v. chemotherapy treatment were prospectively evaluated within an observation period of 4 months. A total of 224 questionnaires using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, Spearman correlation were evaluated. Results: The median age of patients was 54 years, 164 patients received i.v. therapy, 60 patients were on oral therapy. 89% of patients with p.o. chemotherapy (50/56) and 67% with i.v. regimens (106/158) would choose p.o. over i.v. therapy, if equal efficacy is guaranteed. Significant differences between the two treatment groups were found in terms of personal benefit (28% versus 58% by i.v./p.o.), reduced malaise under p.o. treatment (26% i.v., 64% p.o.), better disease coping by oral chemotherapy (36% i.v., 68% p.o.). A reduction of side effects due to p.o. regimens is seen by 18% of i.v. versus 52% of p.o. patients. Conclusions: The p.o. chemotherapy has a major role in the palliative treatment of metastatic breast cancer and shows a high acceptance in patients under therapy. Prerequisite for successful treatment remains compliance, which can be achieved in particular through a differentiated indication, patient education and competent support along a p.o. treatment.

However, AI are more frequently associated with arthralgia than tamoxifen. Prospective data are lacking on the effects of AI-associated arthralgia on patient compliance and patient outcomes as well as treatment costs of arthralgia in routine clinical practice. Materials and methods: COMPACT is an open, prospective, noninterventional study assessing the incidence of arthralgia, therapy costs, and compliance within the first year of adjuvant anastrozole therapy in postmenopausal patients with HR + EBC. The study is sponsored by AstraZeneca and supported by German health insurance funds [GWQ ServicePlus AG, DAK].

Breast cancer patients expressing TF showed higher survival rates compared to TF negative breast cancer patients. Galectin-1 (Gal-1) is known to bind TF in choriocarcinoma patients and induces signal transduction in these cells. The aim of this study was to investigate role of Gal-1 in TF positive/negative breast cancer cells in vitro. Materials and methods: Breast cancer cell lines CAMA1 with high expression and MDA-MB-231 with no expression of TF were used for the study. The cell lines were incubated with 60 lg/ml recombinant Gal-1 in DMEM for 48 h. Apoptosis rates were determined by nick translation, immuncytochemistry with a M30 Cytodeath antibody and a cell death detection ELISA. Proliferation was measured by a BrdU cell proliferation ELISA. Receptor tyrosine kinase-expression patterns were analyzed by a Phosphor-RTK Array and quantified with the ''Quantikine''software. Results: Gal-1 inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of the CAMA1 cell line. MDA-MB-231 cell lines showed a higher proliferation rate and an unaffected apoptosis rate after Gal-1 stimulation. The Phosphor-RTK-Array resulted in a down regulation of ErbB2 and an up regulation of ErbB4 after stimulation of CAMA1. Stimulated MDA-MB-231 had a lower expression for EGFR and a highly elevated Axl. Conclusions: TF high expressing breast cancer cells showed low proliferation rate and higher amount of apoptotic cells, compared to breast cancer cells with no expression of this antigen. In addition, signal transduction processes were completely different in both cell lines. Therefore we speculate that Gal-1 induced signal transduction via TF is one factor responsible for high survival rates of TF positive patients.

Materials and methods: This is a prospective, cross-sectional study, including women from various geographical regions ofGreece.  Between October 2005 and June 2009, 4,373  Greek women completed the study questionnaire, which included questions about the demographic characteristics of participants, their personal history, knowledge about the natural history of HPV infection and cervical cancer, and methods currently used for primary and secondary prevention of cervical cancer. The following inclusion criteria were used: female participants only; age 18-65 years; Greek as native language and residency in Greece. Results: The largest age group among the 4,373 participants was that of women aged 30-39 years (26.5%). Whereas 66.5% of women were well-informed about cervical cytology (Pap-test), 32% were not. Only 40.8% of women answered that they have had a Pap-test at least three times; 33% had only one Pap-test, while 26% answered that they have never had a Pap-test. Forty four per cent of women were aware that cervical cancer can be prevented, 46% have heard about HPV, but 76% were not aware of the etiological association between HPVinfection and cervical cancer. Only 29% of women knew how HPV can be transmitted. Regarding HPV-testing, 42% of participants were aware of, while 40% have never heard of HPV-testing. The majority of women (59%) would be vaccinated against HPV, while 9.5% would not accept to be vaccinated.Conclusions: Greek women are poorly informed about cervical cancer prevention, HPV infection and HPV-testing. Acceptability of preventive vaccination against HPV, and participation in cervical cancer screening are currently far from ideal.

Materials and methods: The original histologic slides from patients primarily treated by radical hysterectomy and systematic pelvic lymphonodectomy were re-examined regarding the occurrence of PNI. PNI was correlated to recurrence free (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: 35.1% of all patients (68/194) represented perineural invasion (=PNI 1). Patients with PNI showed significant reduced RFS-rate at 5-years, when compared to patients without PNI (5-year RFS of 69.5% [95% CI: 57.2-81.8%] for PNI 1 and of 78.3% [95% CI: 70.9-85.7%] for PNI 0 but without statistical significance (p = 0.3). The 5-year-overall-survival-rate was significantly decreased in patients with PNI 1 (PNI 1: 51.1% [95% CI: 38.0-64.2] versus PNI 0: 75.6% [95% CI: 67.8-83.4]; p = 0.001).In a separate analysis the prognostic impact persisted in the node negative, but disappeared in the node positive cases. In multivariate analysis, pelvic lymph node involvement and PNI were independent prognostic factors for overall survival.Conclusions: A reliable number of patients with CX show perineural invasion (PNI). PNI might represent a prognostic factor but, its clinical implication is unclear at time. Further studies are required to get a deeper insight about the clinical impact and the pathogenetic mechanisms of PNI in CX.

We report our results before and after introduction of a quality management program (QM) in AOC in 2001. The QM included: OP by dedicated surgical teams only, routine interdisciplinary pre-OP consultation, 2nd opinion intra-OP before closure in all patients with any macroscopic residuals deemed inoperable, and annual quality conferences. Materials and methods: Analysis of 396 patients with primary surgery for AOC FIGO IIB-IV in our institution (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) . Results: Between 1997-2000 19/51 patients (37%) had complete debulking. This rate increased to 51% in 2001-2003 (n = 86) and 64% in 2004-2008 (n = 259) . The corresponding rates of debulking to B1 cm residual tumor were 72, 87, and 90%, respectively. The utilisation of extended surgical procedures increased over time, e.g. bowel resection (33-67%), splenectomy (4-18%), diaphragmal stripping (2-44%), and paraaortic lymphadenectomy (29-81%). Patients with complete resection had 5-YSR of 57% (median OS = 68 months) compared to 15.7% (median OS = 30.7 months) in patients with residuals 1-10 mm, and 15.1% (median OS = 17 months) in patients with residuals [1 cm (p \\ 0.001).

Conventional retropubic or transobturator tapes actually are preferred by most surgeons, but shows side effects and complications because of the blind passage of the tape. The sling AjustTM has eliminated the need for blind trocar passing, utilizing a single vaginal incision and a push-in technique and allows a post-insertion bi-directional adjustability (loosen and tighten) after strong anchoring in obturator membrane. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of this new procedure with 1 year clinical outcome. Materials and methods: In our prospective, single-arm, observational study 52 patients with a mean age of 62.8 years (range 39-88 years.) were treated from November 2008 to March 2009 with AjustTM in 4 centres. Each patient had a fully urogynecological assessment. Quality of Life was to be assessed using Kings Health Questionnaire, Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale, Visual Analog Score for pain and global satisfaction and short form of UDI 6 and IIQ7. Results: These are first results after 1 year of 52 patients. All but 1 (98.1%, 51/52) of the Ajust Sling placement procedures was initially successful, changing in 1 case intraoperatively to TOT system. No complication of bleeding [200 ml, bladder lesions, erosions, perforations, hematomas or bladder outlet obstructions occurred during the period covered by this analysis. Overall, out of the 50 subjects who successfully received the Ajust Sling, 48 subjects demonstrated total restoration (86.5%) of their continence, 1 subject demonstrated improvement (2.0%). Conclusions: First results showed a high efficacy with excellent continence rates because of the strong anchoring in the obturator membrane and no severe side effects in fact of using a small mini-sling and possibility of bi-directional adjustability after insertion. Further prospective studies with a longer follow-up have to prove the high efficacy.PO-Gyn 03.03 Reoperation for pelvic organ prolapse within 10 years of primary surgery for prolapse Objective: During the past few years, a variety of high frequency sealing devices for vessel ligation has been introduced.

Results: The mean diameter of all arteries sealed did not differ significantly between both groups (MS 5.40 mm vs. LS 5.35 mm, p = 0.79). The mean sealing time was significantly shorter using the reusable device (MS 5.2 s vs. LS 9.1 s, p \\ 0.0001). With respect to sealing failure rate, we did not find a significant difference between both groups (MS 7.0% vs. LS 9.1%, p = 0.28). In addition, analysis of mean burst pressure did not reveal a significant difference between the different devices (MS 429 mmHg vs. LS 484 mmHg, p = 0.16). Conclusions: In our in-vivo animal study, the new reusable MS device appears to be equivalent effective for vessel sealing when compared to the conventional disposable LS device. Objective: A sufficient margin assessment when excising a DCIS of the breast is difficult. Frozen section is unreliable and intraoperative radiography of the specimen gives only information about the size of the noticed lesion or the microcalcifications. This trial was conducted to study the benefit of a novel device (MarginProbe \u00d2 , Dune Medical Devices.

Materials and methods: A multi center, single arm study was conducted to determine the added benefit of the device use. The device was used as an adjunctive tool to the current practice. The surgeon received real time device output and reacted surgically intraoperatively. Based on the permanent histology report outcome, the added benefit of device use is demonstrated.

Materials and methods: We investigated whether the GPR30 plays a role in mediating proliferating effect of tamoxifen in endometrial carcinoma cell lines. These results were compared to the GPR30 expression pattern in endometrial tissue from a cohort of 95 breast cancer patients, who received tamoxifen or another adjuvant therapy. Results: In vitro tamoxifen significantly stimulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and cell proliferation of endometrial cell lines. This effect was blocked by knocking down GPR30 by specific anti-sense oligonucleotides. In vivo, there was a significant correlation between GPR30 expression and the tamoxifeninduced endometrial pathology (p = 0.006). Tamoxifen-associated endometrial pathology was observed in 40 of 58 (69%) specimens positive for GPR30 and in only 13 of 38 (24.5%) tissues immunostained negatively for GPR30. Moreover, GPR30 positivity was predictive of an earlier development of symptoms, such as bleeding or suspect endometrial thickness, induced by tamoxifen therapy (p = 0.019). Conclusions: GPR30 is more possibly an important player of tamoxifen-induced endometrial abnormalities.PO-Onko 03.59 Ovarian teratoma associated with Anti-N-Methyl D-Aspartate (NMDA) antibodies and severe encephalitis Objective: Epithelioid sarcoma of the vulva is an extremely rare and aggressive tumor, accounting for approx. 1% of all vulvar malignancies. Symptoms and growth are usually asymptomatic, therefore lesions are often mistaken for benign processes, leading to diagnosis at later stages. A case report with therapy including recurrence and follow up is presented. Materials and methods: Case report of a recurrent epithelioid vulva sarcoma from a university gynecological cancer center with follow up of 16 months. Results: A 19-year-old patient was admitted with a slowly growing, slightly painful tumor at the left labium that developed over previous 2 years before resected in 11/2008. Proximal type of an epithelioid sarcoma was diagnosed by immunohistology. Staging by CT of thorax and abdomen showed no metastases. Since R0 status was unconfirmed in first procedure e.m., second surgery was done in 02/ 2009 and a residual tumor of 1.5 cm was removed. The diagnosis of vulva-sarcoma pT1b, pN0, M0, G3, R0 with close margins was confirmed. Subsequently, adjuvant radiation with 54 + 9 Gy in the tumor region was administered from 5-7/2009. Re-staging in 7/ and 10/2009 showed no evidence of disease. In 11/2009 a suspect left inguinal lymph node was detected by ultrasound. Biopsy proved relapse of sarcoma and patient underwent inguinal and pelvic lymph node dissection with only n = 1/53 positive lymph node. Radiation of left groin was recommended but refused by patient. In 1/2010 CT revealed inguinal lymph nodes suspicious for second relapse but another biopsy performed was benign. Recent follow up in 3/2010 was uneventful. Conclusions: Complete operative resection according to guidelines is crucial for therapy of vulva-sarcomas. Surgery combined with radiotherapy offer better local control and should be considered for G3-tumors or too close surgical margins.

Nowadays, in the clinic, hyperthermia can be used concomitant to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and may improve the effect of those classical treatments. In previous projects, we investigated the expression of different splicing factors, such as YB-1, in malignancies. Overexpression of YB-1 in malignant cells has been described in various studies and YB-1 seemed to play an important role in the development of tumors as well as in the occurrence of resistances to chemotherapies. In the present study we focussed on the effect of hyperthermia at a molecular level, specifically its impact on the expression YB-1 in cancers. Materials and methods: Various gynaecological cancer cell lines were cultured under hyperthermia (2 h, 42\u00b0C) followed by maintenance under normal conditions (4 h, 37\u00b0C). RNA and protein were isolated using TRIzol \u00d2 method and expression levels were subsequently analysed by RT-PCR and Western Blot. Results: The analyses revealed a markedly decreased level of YB-1 RNA and protein in the breast, cervical, endometrial as well as ovarian cancer cell lines treated with hyperthermia compared to the cell lines treated under normal condition. Conclusions: Our results suggest that hyperthermia could have an impact on the expression of splicing factors such as YB-1. Thus, hyperthermia might be a way to influence the progression of malignancies and could improve the response to chemotherapeutical treatments.

Loss of apico-basal orientation and cell-cell contacts which are dependent on non-centrosomal microtubule (MT) nucleation are important step in malignant progression. Moreover, BRCA associated breast cancers show an undifferentiated ''basal-like'' phenotype suggesting that MT nucleation which requires an orchestrated interplay of MT-associated proteins is disturbed in BRCA1 tumors. We aimed to investigate the expression pattern of the MT-associated proteins phosphorylated hyaloronan receptor (pT703RHAMM) and its activating kinase aurora (AURKA) in undifferentiated breast cancers with of without inactivating BRCA1 mutations. Materials and methods: Paraffin embedded specimen from sporadic differentiated and undifferentiated breast cancers and control tissue from reduction mammoplasties were subjected to immunohistochemistry with primary antibodies targeted against pT703RHAMM and AURKA. Stained slides were scored by two blinded investigators. Results: Tumor specimen showed a homogenous cytoplasmic staining pattern of AURKA. RHAMM-phosphorylation occurred at the nuclear envelope of some nuclei, but mitotic chromosomes in pro-and meta-but not in ana-or telophase showed a strong pT703RHAMM staining. Conclusions: Whereas AURKA distribution appears to be more or less homogenous RHAMM phosphorylation occurs at the nuclear envelope in interphase nuclei, and at mitotic chromosomes in pro-and anaphase in breast cancer tissues.

We decided to continue Bevacizumab mono up to 1 year and discontinued therapy in August 2009. The patient still shows no signs of disease in March 2010 (FU 15 months). Conclusions: Therapy of triple negative inflammatory breast cancer with Bevacizumab and Carboplatin is far from being a standard. But in the desperate case of recurrent disease not responding to standard chemotherapy it may be an option and should be more thoroughly evaluated. Objective: Aim of the study was to identify novel biomarkers, which may be useful for the stratification of patients with ovarian cancer in responder and non-responder subgroups with respect to platinumbased chemotherapies in combination with gemcitabine, pemetrexed and enzastaurin.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PO-Onko 03.79"}, {"text": "We investigated the RNA expression of a panel of 73 candidate genes and further panel of 54,000 human transcripts using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis in the ovarian cancer cell line HEY and its drug-resistant subclones against cisplatin, etoposide, docetaxel, paclitaxel, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, TRAIL and enzastaurin that had been stimulated with 10 lM enzastaurin for 1 and 24 h, respectively. First, unstimulated na\u00efve HEY cells were compared to each of the other chemoresistant HEY cell types in order to get possible insight into resistance mechanisms. Second, gene expression were analyzed before and after the treatment time with enzastaurin at 1 and 24 h for each chemoresistant HEY cell type, in order to identify genes that are differentially expressed under enzastaurin stimulation. Results: Interestingly, treatment with enzastaurin for 24 h led to remarkable change of differential gene expression in the most enzastaurin-sensitive cisplatin-resistant HEY subclone, but also in the enzastaurin-resistant HEYs compared to the parental and other drugresistant HEY cell lines (24 genes (39 probe-sets) and more than 30 genes (64 probe-sets)). Conclusions: These findings indicate that (i) enzastaurin may be synergistic to cisplatin and (ii) enzastaurin could be used as a second line treatment to overcome enzastaurin resistance and (iii) the newly identified genes may be used as a biomarker kit for clinical trials in ovarian cancer using enzastaurin and cisplatin.

Materials and methods: A questionnaire was developed and validated in a phase-I study and was then administered to OC patients via internet (online) or as a print-version. Results: A total of 676 patients were interviewed (201 online, 475 print version). In the online group 97% had an own internet access 49% in the print group. The median age of the online group was 49 years (range 19-73), for the print group 62 years (26-92). 39% of the patients had recurrent OC. The most effective and ''patient-relevant'' source of information and explanation of treatment options was the consultation with their physician (88%). All patients judged the therapeutic consultation by their physician on a likert scala (1: very bad, 10: very well): Completeness: 8; understanding: 8; response to questions: 9; competence of physician: 10; shared decision: 9 and involvement of relatives into therapy decision: 8. When asked to suggest areas for improvement, most frequent answers were: doctors should have more time for explanations (46%); no alopecia under treatment (35%); therapy should be made to be more effective (31%). The most stated answers to ''How do you measure the success of a therapy?'' were: based on my current well-being (55%); response of the tumour marker CA 125 (45%); based on the feedback that I receive from my doctor (38%). An independent second opinion centre was desired by 70% of the patients, but only 20% know such an institution. Borderline tumours of the ovary (BOT) are rare tumour entities thateven though they can display characteristics of malignant tumoursdo not show any destructive or invasive growth in the majority of cases. BOT represent about 8-10% of all ovarian tumours, but the differential diagnosis remains difficult. The mucinous subtype can also originate from the appendix, and ovarian metastases can mimic primary ovarian BOT, often accompanied by peritoneal manifestation in terms of pseudomyxoma peritonei. In cases where a concomitant appendiceal tumour is present, it may prove difficult to determine the primary tumour. Therefore in most guidelines involving a mucinous borderline tumour an additional appendectomy is recommended as a routine surgical procedure. We present a special case with a concrete example for the complexity of the differential diagnosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei, especially if a case is simultaneously linked to appendiceal and ovarian cancer. Moreover, this case is exceptional for its unusual manifestation of BOT in the cervix. According to our information, only one other case of endocervical manifestation of a BOT has been reported so far. The fact that borderline cells were found in the endocervix indicates the ability of this tumour to form metastases outside of the abdominal cavity. Until now the widely accepted opinion is that this tumour can only spread by direct seeding. Irrespective of the place of origin, whether it is the ovary or the appendix, this mode and site of metastatic dispersal is uncommon and might indeed be capable of indicating a sign of increased metastatic activity and thus malignancy. Objective: Despite radical surgery and chemotherapy at primary diagnosis, most patients with ovarian cancer develop recurrence and die due to progressive disease. To stratify patients for optimal therapy, prognostic and predictive factors are needed. We therefore examined the role of CA-125 in this context. Materials and methods: A total of 233 patients with primary ovarian cancer who presented for surgery at our institution between 1996 and 2004 were included in this study (25% stage I/II and 75% stage III/ IV). The prognostic and predictive significance of CA-125 serum concentrations before and after surgery and correlation with clinicopathological variables were analyzed. Results: Median preoperative CA-125 in stage I/II was 61.6 kU/l (9-1867 kU/l) and 533.15 kU/l in stage III/IV (10-22617 kU/l). 67% of FIGO I/II patients had elevated CA-125 levels ([35 kU/l) before surgery and 96% of FIGO III/IV patients. There was a significant decrease of CA-125 after surgery (61.6 vs. 43.4kU/l, p = 0.001 and 533.15 vs. 92.3 kU/l, p \\ 0.001, respectively). Neither preoperative and postoperative CA-125 concentration nor its decrease had prognostic relevance for recurrence and survival in any stage. Conclusions: Although CA-125 serum levels differ significantly before and after surgery in early and advanced stage ovarian cancer patients we could not find a prognostic or predictive value for this marker.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PO-Onko 03.87 Clinical outcome of tertiary surgical cytoreduction in epithelial ovarian cancer relapse"}, {"text": "The clinical relevance of certain cytokines, steroid hormones and oxalate in mamma carcinoma patients Objective: Possible parameters for the biochemical monitoring of breast tumors are reactive C1-and C2-molecules, that are generated Objective: For the identification of genital malformations in patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser-Syndrome (MRKH-syndrome) there are the following means of diagnosis: clinical examination, ultrasound imaging, magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) and laparoscopy. This study compared the different diagnostic means in order to classify the genital malformations in the best way. Materials and methods: The assessment of the genital malformations was based on the VCUAM-classification. For the individual organs the following reference methods were settled: vagina-clinical examination, cervix, uterus and adnexa-laparoscopy, kidney-MRI. The study analysed the concordance of the different diagnostic methods with the reference methods in 138 patients with MRKH-syndrome. Results: The MRI did not turn out to be an ideal method for assessing the vagina when compared with the reference method of diagnosing the vagina (kappa = 0.74). It was not possible to make any substantial findings regarding the vagina using Ultrasound and laparoscopy. Because the examination results rarely mentioned the cervix separately, it was also not possible to assess the best classification of the cervix. MRI was a very good means in terms of classifying the uterus (kappa = 0.93) but also ultrasound imaging showed a high rate of agreement (kappa = 0.83). None of the imaging methods was able to achieve a sufficient classification of the adnexa. Ultrasound imaging was held to be a good method to find renal malformations in comparison with the reference method (kappa = 0.87). Conclusions: Mainly clinical examination, MRI and ultrasound are sufficient for the assessment of genital malformations in MRKHpatients. However malformations of the adnexa were not sufficiently diagnosed using both imaging techniques. In order to correctly assess the adnexa it is compulsory to perform laparoscopy which all patients receive when creating a neovagina.

Autoimmune thyroid disorders, which may result in an abnormal/damaged thyroid follicular structure, are characterized by the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies (Ab). A potential relationship with impaired fertility and increased pregnancy loss has been suggested, but results of most trials are inconclusive. Materials and methods: A total of 222 women who presented for the first time in our outpatient endocrine clinic with (pre/post-)menopausal complaints (median age 49 years) were screened for thyroid function (TSH, T3, T4), and for thyreoglobulin(TG), thyroid peroxidase(TPO)-and TSH receptor(TR)-Ab using standard serum assays. The same day all patients were interviewed for previous obstet./gyn. events as part of a complete medical history. Results: Thyroid autoimmunity was detected in 22.5% (50/222) women: TG-Ab in 20.7% (46/222), TPO-Ab in 12.6% (28/222), with a significant relationship between both parameters (p \\ 0.0001), TR-Ab in 1.4%.

Significantly more women with pathological TG-Ab levels reported on previous abortions: in 21.7% compared to 9.7% in the group without TG Ab (p \\ 0.03), and in 25.0% in case of elevated TPO-Ab compared to 10.4%. The prevalence of these Ab was without difference in patients \\/[49 years, but TPO-Ab were more frequent in women [56 years (75% age perc.) (p \\ 0.05), no relationship was found with the BMI. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that thyroid autoimmunity is very frequent in peri/post-menopausal women (TG-and/or TPO-Ab in 22.5%), and that this autoimmunologic reaction is significantly associated with a higher risk of abortion and a lower life-birth rate on retrospective analysis. Objective: Uterine contractility is important not only for labor, but also for the transport of semen and gametes, and successful embryo implantation. Uterine activity is regulated by complex and mutual interactions among sex-steroids, neurohypophysial-hormones, and neurotransmitters. It also involves the integration of many signaltransducing events, resulting in precise coordination of myometrial contractile activity. There are many uterotonic agents and also many intracellular effectors that are known to be crucial for efficient uterine smooth-muscle contraction-such as oxytocin, various prostaglandins, and muscarinic receptor-agonists. Some of these compounds are also present in seminal plasma. It has been known since the 1930s that seminal plasma can induce contractions and even cramps in humans. The aim of this study was to test an experimental uterus perfusion model as to whether it can be used to analyze uterine contraction patterns after the administration of human seminal plasma. Materials and methods: Each swine uterus was perfused in a perfusion system with Krebs-Ringer solution. After 45 min with rhythmical spontaneous contractions present, human seminal plasma was administered via a catheter intrauterine and the intrauterine pressure was recorded. Results: An increase in intrauterine pressure (IUP) in the isthmus uteri and corpus uteri was observed after the administration of seminal plasma or buffer solution. The direct comparison of the intrauterine pressure over time after administration of seminal plasma or buffer solution shows a significant pressure rise with seminal plasma. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that seminal plasma has an effect in these preliminary experiments in that it stimulates uterine contractions and may enhance sperm transport. The clinical implication of the results of our pilot study would be that the application of seminal plasma in artificial insemination could increase the chance of conception also in humans, due to the increase of uterine contractility.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Department of Gynecological Endrocrinology, Womens' Hospital University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"}, {"text": "The 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase 66A[G/I22 M mutation is associated with decreased anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone concentrations and lower number of retrieved oocytes after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation Objective: The one-carbon metabolism is an essential process in the biological network that regulates the biosynthesis of nucleosides and the methylation of proteins, lipids, and DNA. Epidemiological evidence suggests that genetic variants of enzymes in the one-carbon metabolism pathway as well as folate intake influence ovarian function. We have shown that A.R.T patients carrying the T allele of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C[T mutation require more FSH for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and produce fewer oocytes. To study this association more closely, we investigated the 66A[G/I22 M mutation of the MTRR enzyme which is also involved in one-carbon metabolism. Materials and methods: This study included 235 patients undergoing IVF/ICSI for male factor (n = 171) or tubal factor infertility (n = 64).

However, not all chemotherapies result in a complete eradication of the follicular-reserve, thus the biopsy itself may impair fertility after chemotherapy. Therefore, we aimed to establish a model assessing the relative change in Anti-M\u00fcllerian-Hormone following ovarian biopsies of varying sizes. Materials and methods: Participants of this longitudinal, prospective, interventional study underwent caesarean-section. AMH was measured by ELISA, 2-15 h before section (d0), as well as 70-75 h (d3) and 3 month (m3) after. At section, cortical pieces from one ovary were removed. Controls had blood sampling at the same time-points but no biopsy. The follicular-density was determined in HE-stained slides. Assessed were absolute and relative short-term (d0-d3), longterm AMH-changes (d0-m3) and correlation between cortex weight, follicular-density and relative AMH-change.Results: Interim-analysis of 12 women with biopsy und 2 controls: In the study-group an absolute and relative median short-term AMHchange of -0.16 ng/ml (-0.61 to 0.01) and -18.45%, were observed, 0.27 ng/ml (0.03-0.50) and 171.21%, respectively in the controls (p = 0.028). The long-term AMH-changes in the study-group were 0.84 ng/ml (0.06-3.03) and 131.9%, 0.67 ng/ml (0.44-0.90) and 283.03%, respectively in the controls (p = 0.27). A correlation between the weight of the biopsy and the relative short-term AMHchange could not be established with statistical significance as well as a correlation between follicular density and AMH d0 or absolute and relative changes. Conclusions: This study shows that even small ovarian biopsies (36-230 lg) result in a short-term AMH-change of -18%. An unexpected finding was the long-term increase in AMH in contrast to a previous study. Thus, AMH behaviour during pregnancy and puerperium needs a re-assessment. The interim-analysis was underpowered to show significant correlations. This is the first study in healthy women estimating the follicular-reserve reduction caused by cortex biopsies.PO-Repro 03.07 Case report: ovarian pregnancy after IVF Objective: Ovarian pregnancy is a rare condition of ectopic pregnancy. The risk of ectopic pregnancy after in vitro fertilization is increased. Due to the increasing number of assisted reproduction the incidence of ectopic pregnancies has risen. The precise etiology of ovarian pregnancy after IVF is still unknown. Materials and methods: We report on a 33-year old primipara, who underwent IVF because of a male factor. During the second IVF-cycle the patient was stimulated with recombinant FSH and GnRH-antagonist. After transvaginal oocyte pickup the patient was admitted to our unit because of OHSS where she has been treated symptomatically. Two embryos were replaced in utero under ultrasound guidance. At gestational age of 8 weeks +1 the patient was admitted again as a result of no ultrasonic sign of intra-or extrauterine viable pregnancy. At this time the patient was asymptomatic. Serum \u00df-hCG level was 2018 mU/ml, 48 h later \u00df-hCG was 1892 mU/ml. The asymptomatic patient insisted in expecting management. At 8 weeks +3 days she developed lower abdominal pain and got hemodynamically instable. Ultrasound revealed an ectopic pregnancy with positive heart action and free echogenic fluid. On laparoscopy there was blood in the upper and lower abdomen. The right ovary showed a ruptured ovarian pregnancy. Placental tissue and a gestational sac could be removed. Bleeding was stanched and the ovary could be preserved. Both tubes were normal and separated from the ovaries. The postoperative period was uneventful. Pathology report confirmed an ovarian pregnancy. Conclusions: Ovarian pregnancy is unfrequent and difficult to diagnose. Increasing number of assisted reproduction and therefore increasing risk of ectopic pregnancies demands intensive monitoring (\u00df-hCG levels, ultrasound). Laparoscopy is the traditional treating method whereas methotrexat therapy can be considered at early diagnosis. Our case fulfills Spielberg criteria for ovarian pregnancy.PO-Repro 03.08 Slow-freezing vs. vitrification in ovarian tissue preservation Objective: Cancer patients benefit from advanced treatments by chemo-and radiotherapy. Gonadotoxic treatments, however, often result in infertility and premature ovarian failure. Slow-cooling is currently the standard for cryopreservation of ovarian tissue prior to chemotherapy. Vitrification could be an effective alternative, however the data on the efficacy of the procedure are still conflicting. We therefore performed a systematic comparison of cryodamage after vitrification versus slow-freezing of human ovarian tissue. Materials and methods: This study was performed at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of L\u00fcbeck. Ovarian tissue biopsies were collected from 17 patients undergoing Caesarean sections. The tissue was cut to pieces, which were randomly frozen using either slow-freezing or vitrification. Vitrification was performed according to the protocol described by Hasegawa (2004) and Wang (2008) . An acupuncture-needle was used as a carrier. Slow-freezing was performed according to the protocol described by Gosden (1994) and Donnez (2008) . After incubation in the cryoprotectant the samples were cooled to minus 150\u00b0C following a multiple step freezingprotocol. Vitrification and slow-freezing samples were stored for at least 2 weeks in liquid-N2. After thawing, the number of viable and damaged follicles was counted, and the proportion of primordial and primary follicles of high-morphological-quality was assessed according to Maltaris (2007) . Results: 277 primordial and primary follicles (137 slow-freezing; 140 vitrification) were counted and analyzed. 23.5% of the samples in the slow-cooling-group showed no high-morphology follicles as compared to 5.8% in the vitrification-group (Fisher's Exact test, p = 0.17). Vitrification resulted in a mean 25.6% increase of primordial and primary follicles with high-morphological-quality (t test for paired samples, p = 0.08).Conclusions: Vitrification shows a trend towards better morphological integrity as compared to slow freezing. Inferiority of vitrification for this outcome is thus unlikely. Taking the ease of vitrification into account, this procedure might become a first choice option for freezing ovarian tissue.PO-Repro 03.09 Oocyte retrieval as an option for fertility preservation of female-to-male transexual patients: a case report *Ioannis Zervomanolakis 1 , Dimitrios Papadopoulos 1 , Mitrodora Botzaki 1 , Afroditi Sialakouma 1 , Dimitrios Garinis 1 , Giles Palmer 1 1 Mitera Clinic, Assisted Reproduction Unit, Marousi, Athens, GreeceObjective: Transexual people have to undergo hormonal and surgical treatments before transition to their desired gender, leading to loss of their reproductive potential. We report a case of a female-to-maletranssexual patient, who underwent oocyte retrieval. Materials and methods: A 30-year-old female-to-male transsexual patient underwent hormonal treatment for over 2 years. The patient received 11.25 mg of Leuprorelin acetate (Trenantone \u00d2 , Takeda Pharma, Germany) for pituitary suppression subcutaneously (s.c.) every 3 months under simultaneous transdermal daily application of 50 mg testosterone (Testogel \u00d2 , Bayer Vital, Germany). A bilateral mastectomy has already been performed, the patient wished to undergo fertility preservation measures before hysterectomy and oophorectomy. After pausing testosterone treatment, the patient received 225 IU highly purified urinary FSH (Altermon \u00d2 , IBSA, Greece) s.c. daily for ten days, followed by 300 IU s.c. daily for three days according to the step-up protocol without pausing leuprorelin treatment. On stimulation day 14 the patient received 250 lg recombinant Choriongonadotropin alfa s.c. (Ovitrelle \u00d2 , Merck Serono, Greece) for ovulation induction, 36 h before oocyte retrieval. Estradiol level on this day reached 4210 pg/ml. Donor sperm (Cryos International, Denmark) was used for in vitro fertilization. Results: 11 of 14 metaphase-II retrieved oocytes were fertilized after ICSI procedure, achieving a fertilization rate of 78.6%. On day 2 after follicle retrieval six 4-cell embryos were vitrified (Medicult Vitrification Cooling \u00d2 , Medicult Denmark). Conclusions: This is the first transexual patient undergoing oocyte retrieval in our clinic. Long-term testosterone application could have a positive impact on oocyte production and oocyte quality, as shown by high number of retrieved oocytes and high fertilization rate. Despite ethical aspects concerning the attitude of medical world, legislation and society towards this group of patients, fertility preservation measures, such as in vitro fertilization, sperm, oocyte or ovarian tissue banking, should be discussed and offered to transexual people undergoing gender reassignment therapy.PO-Repro 03.10 Ongoing pregnancy after hMG stimulation/timedintercourse in a 40 year old woman with undetectable AMH levels Objective: In adult women, Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is synthesized by granulosa cells in primary to early antral follicles. Serum levels of AMH correlate closely with the antral follicular count and predict ooctye yield in ovarian stimulation cycles. Furthermore, AMH serves as a marker of ovarian reserve, and the gradual decline in the primordial follicle pool is best represented by decreasing levels of AMH. Women with an extremely low AMH level have a severely diminished ovarian reserve and have a severely reduced prospect for clinical pregnancy using IVF. Materials and methods: This is a case report of a 40 year old female patient with AMH levels below the detection limit (\\0.05 ng/ml) measured by active MIS/AMH ELISA (Beckman Coulter). The patient had a history of secondary infertility for 2 years. Two pregnancies were achieved in a previous relationship resulting in live births in 1997 and 2005. In 2004 the diagnosis of premature ovarian failure had already been established by her gynecologist. Despite this diagnosis, the patient underwent a treatment trial with clomifene 50 mg at a different gynecologic department and she conceived by timed intercourse in 2004. In a new relationship in 2007 she tried to conceive again spontaneously, without success. In 2009 she came to our department with childwish and oligomenorrhea. The evaluation of early follicular phase hormone levels revealed a FSH of 26mIU/ml and AMH \\0.05 ng/ml. Results: Before treatment was started the antral follicular count was 2. Early follicular phase hormone levels were measured: Progesterone 0.7 ng/ml, E2 42 pg/ml, LH 8.2 mIU/ml, FSH 26 mIU/ml, prolactin 7.6 ng/ml, testosterone 2.49 nmol/l, DHEA-sulfate 1.9 lg/ml. The semen analysis showed teratozoospermia. The first cycle was stimulated with clomifene 50 mg as performed previously (resulting in live birth in 2005), but E2 remained low (peak level 18 pg/ml) and no follicular development was observed. A second treatment cycle was performed with daily 75 IU of menopausal gonadotrophin stimulation. Two follicles developed with a pre-ovulatory E2 level of 174 pg/ ml, and ovulation induction was performed with 5,000 IU of hCG subcutaneously on cycle day 10. The couple had timed intercourse resulting in a pregnancy which is at 23 ? 6 weeks at the time writing. Conclusions: Two pregnancies were achieved by a patient despite of undetectable AMH levels, a low antral follicle count, elevated FSH and oligomenorrhoea. This leads to the conclusion that low AMH levels should be interpreted with caution when predicting the chance of pregnancy for individual cases. Further investigations of low or undetectable AMH levels and spontaneous pregnancies are needed to evaluate the incidence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 5691, "end": 5706, "text": "Hasegawa (2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5711, "end": 5722, "text": "Wang (2008)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5837, "end": 5850, "text": "Gosden (1994)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5855, "end": 5868, "text": "Donnez (2008)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6262, "end": 6277, "text": "Maltaris (2007)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}]}
