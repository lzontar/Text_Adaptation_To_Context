The composition of the interfaces of three common classes of pathological microbes, bacteria, viruses, and fungi, is discussed so that surfactant and cleaning product development scientists better understand their interfacial characteristics. Studies of antimicrobial efficacy from the four major classes of surfactants (cationic, anionic, amphoteric, and nonionic) are shown. The need for preservatives in surfactants is elucidated. The regulatory aspects of antimicrobials in cleaning products to make antimicrobial claims are stressed.",

Natural disasters in recent years have had a more severe impact, particularly when large metropolitan areas are affected. These events may disrupt water, sanitation, healthcare access, and hygiene practices; in addition, those who require sheltering during and after such events are at higher risk for illness due to crowded conditions (Watson et al., 2007) .",

Its ability to lyze many types of cell membranes makes it a potential candidate for cancer treatment; however, to avoid lysis of noncancer cells, targeting cancer cell receptors is needed (Wu, 2017) . Kabara (1972) found that fatty acids demonstrated efficacy against bacteria and yeast. Lauric acid was found to be the most effective of the saturated fatty acids, indicating that optimal hydrophobicity plays a role in microefficacy. Monoenoic and dienoic (cis-configuration) acids showed improved efficacy over saturated acids; transconfigurations had no microefficacy. Among derivatives of fatty acids, esterification reduces microefficacy, but derivatization to aldehyde, alcohol, or amine forms improves it. Desbois and Smith (2010) indicates that free fatty acids target cell membranes and disrupt electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, and may play a role in cell membrane lysis and interference in other cellular metabolic pathways.",

Through case studies, it was demonstrated that surfactants aid in the killing of microbes that cause illness. Examples of microefficacy have been demonstrated in all major surfactant classes, but not all surfactants will demonstrate microefficacy, not all microbes will be equally susceptible to surfactants, and structural differences in a particular surfactant type can have an impact on antimicrobial efficacy. Microefficacy may also vary with formulation variables such as pH and ionic strength. Formulators who seek antimicrobial claims on disinfecting products should consult local regulations for the appropriate testing methodologies and requirements for making claims. This article, as it was derived from a conference presentation, is not intended to be a full review of this topic, but an overview to guide those formulating antimicrobial cleaning products for inanimate surfaces.",
