These viral infections mainly affect young chickens, causing apathy, depression, ruffled feathers, cloacal pasting, and diarrhea. Chicken Parvovirus (ChPV) is such an infection and has been detected in chickens showing signs of enteric diseases worldwide. Therefore, the present study aims to develop a sensitive real-time fast-qPCR assay based on SYBR \u00ae Green for detection and quantification of ChPV. A 561-bp non-structural (NS) gene was amplified and cloned, and a pair of primers was designed based on conserved nucleotide sequences on the NS gene of ChPV, the intercalating DNA reagent SYBR \u00ae Green was employed, and the Fast mode of a thermocycler was used. The assay detects 10 9 to 10 1 copies of the genome (CG). The limit of detection (LoD) was estimated to five CG, and the limit of quantification (LoQ) was estimated at ten CG. The standard curve efficiency was 101.94%, and the melting curve showed a unique clean peak and a melting temperature of 79.3 \u2022 C. The assay was specific to amplify the ChPV NS gene, and no amplification was shown from other viral genomes or in the negative controls. A total of 141 samples were tested using the assay, of which 139 samples were found positive. The highest CG value of ChPV was 5.7 \u00d7 10 6 CG/uL of DNA without apparent clinical signs of enteric disturbance, and 4.6 \u00d7 10 6 CG/uL DNA were detected in chickens with RSS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) is a pathogen that afflicts young, one-week-old chicks, causing poor feed conversion, stunting, dwarfism, culling and mortality [1] [2] [3] . Generally, the chicks present with depression, apathy, ruffled feathers, cloacal pasting, and the most characteristic signs, diarrhea and unsteadiness [3, 4] . The etiological agents related to RSS remain unknown; however, many viruses have been detected and implicated as causative agents of the disease, including astroviruses, coronaviruses, rotaviruses, reovirus, parvovirus, and others [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Parvovirus is a viral agent that affects many animals, including mammals such as cows, dogs, cats, rats, and bats [11] . Many experimental infections have been carried out using isolated enteric viruses, such as astrovirus, avian nephritis virus (ANV), rotavirus, and Chicken Parvovirus (ChVP), to elucidate the pathogenesis of RSS [6, 12, 13] . These studies have determined the ChPV might be an etiological agent associated with RSS and could be considered a principal causal agent of this enteric disease [3, 14] . Additionally, in Muscovy ducks, ChPV causes Derzsy's disease [15] . In chickens, it was associated with curvature of the duodenal loop, pancreatic atrophy, and mesenteritis [16] , and it has been detected in chickens and turkeys showing signs of enteric diseases and in apparently healthy animals [17] [18] [19] . ChPV is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, double-stranded DNA virus that was first reported to cause enteric disturbances in 10-day-old chicks [4] . Many other studies have been done, thereafter, to elucidate the role of ChPV in enteric disorders, diarrhea, and other enteric manifestations [3, 13] . The fully assembled ChPV genome is 5275 bp in length and is organized in the non-structural (NS) gene that encodes a non-structural protein and contains ORF1 and ORF2, which are proteins involved in viral replication; the VP1 and VP2 genes that encode the structural proteins that make up the viral capsid, and the NP1 gene that contains ORF3, which is located between ORF1 and ORF2 [20] . Based on the sequences of these genes, a PCR end-point and real-time PCR (qPCR) assays were developed for ChPV identification [21] . The majority of these assays focused on the NS gene [8, 22, 23] because it is the most conserved gene in ChPV. The first PCR assay developed was described by Zsak et al. [8] where the primers flanked a conserved region of the NS gene, and currently, two qPCR assays were developed based on the same NS region [22] . Another qPCR assay was developed to amplify part of the VP2 gene region [21] . All of these assays showed a high sensitivity for ChPV detection and quantification. In the Brazilian chicken flocks in the recent years, many outbreaks of RSS have been reported where ChPV has been detected, and the NS gene was sequenced, confirming that the sequences belonged to ChPV, identifying the virus in young and old chickens as early as the first day of infection [9, 16, [24] [25] [26] . Enteric diseases cause economic losses in poultry, the depreciation of poultry flocks, and increased susceptibility to other diseases, so a rapid, efficacious, affordable, reliable assay should be standardized for the diagnosis of the etiological agent [27] [28] [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 163, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 164, "end": 167, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 168, "end": 171, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 325, "end": 328, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 329, "end": 331, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 565, "end": 568, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 569, "end": 572, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 573, "end": 576, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 577, "end": 580, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 581, "end": 584, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 585, "end": 589, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 706, "end": 710, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 924, "end": 927, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 928, "end": 931, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 932, "end": 935, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1103, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1107, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1175, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1287, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1411, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1416, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1421, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1569, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1717, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1721, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2107, "end": 2111, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2240, "end": 2244, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2299, "end": 2302, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2306, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2307, "end": 2310, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2417, "end": 2420, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2556, "end": 2560, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2635, "end": 2639, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3017, "end": 3020, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3021, "end": 3024, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3025, "end": 3029, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3030, "end": 3034, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3035, "end": 3039, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3295, "end": 3299, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3300, "end": 3304, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3305, "end": 3309, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In the present study, we report the development of a highly sensitive real-time fast-qPCR assay based on SYBR \u00ae Green for detection and quantification of ChPV, which is faster than other current assays due its combination of cycle steps, faster changes in temperature, faster enzymes, and is so sensitive that very low concentrations of the virus present in the enteric contents of animals with or without clinical signs of enteric disease can be detected.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The sampling comprised 141 samples of enteric content of randomly selected chickens (broilers, laying hens, and breeders) from several states of Brazil and was received between the years 2000 to 2016.

The diagnosis of etiological agents in poultry has been important for controlling and improving sanitation in chicken flocks [31] . Commonly, viruses, such as ChPV, have been detected using negative stain electron microscopy in which viral particles were visualized and classified according to their morphology [14, 32] . Later, serological assays were used as a diagnostic tool [19] , such as ELISA. Currently, several molecular diagnostic methods have been developed for the detection of ChPV, and PCR is the most employed for amplification and detection of portions of the ChPV genome [8, 20] . The first PCR assay for ChPV detection focused on the NS gene and has been used in several studies; however, this assay might detect but does not quantify the virus [8] . Therefore, a qPCR for detection and quantification of ChPV has been developed for the NS gene [22] and the VP2 gene [21] . Our study showed that this real-time fast-qPCR is very sensitive, based on the SYBR \u00ae Green assay, besides reducing the reaction time during amplification when compared with standard qPCR. The assay efficiency curve was 101.94% showing that the results are highly reliable, and the standard curve can be used for an absolute quantification of the viral genome. In addition, the melting curve showed a unique peak at 79.03 \u2022 C that could be used to confirm ChPV in a sample, and therefore avoid false-negative results in tissue samples with interfering DNA, such as thymus, spleen, bursa, and blood [33, 34] . Hence, in the present study, ChPV was detected and quantified in the enteric contents of broilers, laying hens, and breeders using the fast-qPCR based on the SYBR \u00ae Green assay that had been reported in previous studies [22] . The concentration of ChPV particles in the samples of the broiler enteric contents previously published showed a high viral concentration in healthy birds and in birds affected with an enteric virus. Similar results were found in the present study in which apparently healthy chickens also showed high viral concentrations [22] . ChPV has been detected in chickens independently of zootechnical interest and in many regions around the world with high chicken production, such as Europe [10, 17, 18] , China [35] , South Korea [36] , North America [8, 37, 38] , Brazil [9, 16, 24, 25] , and Ecuador [26, 38] ; however, its presence remains unknown in the rest of South America. The present study also showed that the virus was detected at earlier and later ages in chickens, demonstrating that virus dissemination can occur at any time [21] . Thus, the present study showed an average of 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 CG in chickens with clinical signs of enteric disease, in an age range from 36 to 42 days old, and in apparently healthy animals in which a high virus concentration (CG) was detected. Presently, only three different genotypes of ChPV have been described around the world, one from the ABU 1 strain from Hungary [4, 20, 39] that is used as a reference genome, one in Korea [36] , and one in China [35] . Therefore, the primers proposed in the present study were designed based on the alignment of the NS gene between the reference sequence of ABU 1 and the ChPV sequences from Korea and China, with a region conserved for all sequences chosen. The sequences of the NS gene obtained in the present study showed a high similarity with other ChPV sequences from other parts of the world, clustering with ChPV, and one sequence clustered with the Turkey Parvovirus (TuPV), but this result does not indicate that this sequence belongs to TuPV [28] . This result is in accordance with other studies in which some partial sequences of the ChPV NS gene cluster with the TuPV genome [28] , which is useful for diagnosis but not for genetic classification for which the VP2 gene is much more suitable [28, 35, 36] . However, other studies should be done to determine which genotypes are currently circulating in poultry flocks in Brazil. This assay showed high sensitivity, detecting a minimum of five copies (LoD) of the viral genome and a maximum (LoQ) of 1 10 CG of ChPV, but a different assay was not as highly sensitive [22] . Finally, the present study documented the development of a sensitive real-time fast-qPCR based on SYBR \u00ae Green for detection and quantification of viral particles that could be used to determine whether a chicken flock is infected with ChPV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 299, "end": 303, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 485, "end": 489, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 490, "end": 493, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 553, "end": 557, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 762, "end": 765, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 766, "end": 769, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 937, "end": 940, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1041, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1063, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1664, "end": 1668, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1672, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1895, "end": 1899, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2225, "end": 2229, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2392, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2393, "end": 2396, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2397, "end": 2400, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2409, "end": 2413, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2428, "end": 2432, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2449, "end": 2452, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2453, "end": 2456, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2457, "end": 2460, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2473, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2474, "end": 2477, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2478, "end": 2481, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2482, "end": 2485, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2500, "end": 2504, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2505, "end": 2508, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2737, "end": 2741, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3111, "end": 3114, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3115, "end": 3118, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3119, "end": 3122, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3172, "end": 3176, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3196, "end": 3200, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3737, "end": 3741, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3873, "end": 3877, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3990, "end": 3994, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3995, "end": 3998, "text": "35,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3999, "end": 4002, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4314, "end": 4318, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The present study showed that the high sensitivity of the real-time fast-qPCR assay based on SYBR \u00ae Green for detection and quantification of ChPV would be useful, saving execution time on screening and quantification of ChPV by almost 50% when compared with standard-qPCR.
