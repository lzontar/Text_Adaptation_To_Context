Initially, the lateral plate forms two layers, the splanchnopleura and the soma topleura, which subsequently develop into the visceral and parietal pleura, respectively. Eventually, it is the visceral pleura that surrounds the lung and the parietal pleura that lines the remainder of the chest cavity. The different embryological origins of the visceral and parietal pleura are responsible for the separate vascular, lymphatic, and neural supplies of these two structures as seen in the adult. By the end of the seventh week of gestation, the diaphragm has separated the thoracic cavity from the peritoneal cavity, and by the third month of gestation the two pleural cavities have expanded sufficiently to encase the pericardium. 4 In the adult, both pleural surfaces are approximately 30 to 40l1m thick and are composed of a single layer of mesothelial cells with an underlying layer of connective tissue. Depending on their location, the mesothelial cells may be flat, cuboidal, or columnar. Mesothelial cells characteristically have numerous microvilli that playa role in phagocytosis as well as contributing to the lubricious nature of the pleural surfaces. Surfactant molecules, produced by the mesothelium, line the pleural surfaces and, secondary to similar electrical charge, repulse each other and facilitate sliding, analogous to the lubrication achieved with graphite. It is these apposing layers of mesothelial cells that form the potential space of the pleural cavity and that glide over each other during respiration.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 834, "end": 835, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The connective tissue layer contains the neurovascular and lymphatic supply of the pleura.

For the visceral pleura, the connective tissue layer is functionally continuous with the fibroelastic network of the lung itself. Functionally, it is this relationship that prevents the visceral pleura from being surgically separated from the surface of a normal lung. Pathological disruption of this connection, however, may result in subpleural air collections known as blebs. s The connective tissue layer for the parietal pleura may also be tightly adherent to the underlying structures, as is characteristic of the diaphragmatic pleura. Around the skeletal portion of the thorax, however, the pleura is bound to the underlying tissue by another connective tissue layer called the endothoracic fascia, which forms a natural cleavage plane. It is this plane that the surgeon develops when performing an \"extrapleural\" dissection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The blood supply to the visceral pleura in humans is thought to reflect that of the lung itself, with a dual arterial supply from both the pulmonary and bronchial arteries and singular venous drainage into the pulmonary veins.

The visceral pleura drains through a lymphatic network into the pulmonary lymphatics, which eventually flow toward the pulmonary hilum. This lymphatic system is richer in the lower lobes than the upper lobes. The parietal pleural lymphatics drain to different locations. The mediastinal pleura drains to the mediastinal and tracheobronchial nodes. The chest wall drains anteriorly to the internal thoracic chain and posteriorly toward the intercostal nodes near the heads of the ribs. The diaphragmatic pleura drains to the parasternal, middle phrenic, and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes.

Kampmeier foci are collections of activated mesothelial and lymphoreticular cells, centered about a lymphatic core, that augment the pleura defensive capabilities. They are concentrated in the lower mediastinal region of the parietal pleura. 6 ,7 Stomata are 2-to 6-~m pores that communicate directly with the parietal pleural lymphatics. During inspiration, these pores have the capacity to stretch, and their architecture is such that they form functional one-way valves. Thus, they provide for a very effective system for draining both fluid and particles, including both red blood cells and macrophages. It is the presence of these pores on the parietal pleural surface that makes it predominantly, if not exclusively, responsible for clearance of cells and particulate matter from the pleural space. It should be noted that although stomata are well studied and characterized in sheep and other mammals, the definitive presence of stomata in humans is less well established.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 357, "end": 361, "text": "6 ,7", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In each hemithorax, the visceral pleura is a continuous surface that completely envelops the entire lung, including the fissures. At the pulmonary hilum, it continues on as the parietal pleura to line the mediastinum, chest wall, diaphragm, and cupola of the chest cavity. In humans, the pleural cavities are completely separate, coming into contact with each other for a short distance behind the upper half of the body of the sternum (Fig. 74.1 ). It is this pleural separation of the right and left chest cavities that prevents bilateral pneumothoraces from occurring as the result of a unilateral chest injury. At the costophrenic and costomediastinal sinuses, the parietal pleural folds back on itself, providing a potential space into which the lungs can expand during inspiration. 8 Superiorly, the pleura extends above the bony thorax into the base of the neck (Fig. 74.2 ). This fact explains why pneumothorax may complicate internal jugular central line placement as well as subclavian central line placement. Anteriorly, the pleura extends to the sixth rib, to the ninth rib laterally, and to the twelfth rib posteriorly ( Fig. 74.2 ). In the living patient, the lung can fill the entire posterior recess. In a review of 100 chest radiographs, 80% of patients were found to have lung present at or below the level of the 12th rib, and in 18% it was seen at the level of the first lumbar vertebra. 9 These external landmarks of the pleural space are of practical clinical significance, particularly when evaluating a patient with penetrating trauma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 788, "end": 789, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1409, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 436, "end": 446, "text": "(Fig. 74.1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 869, "end": 879, "text": "(Fig. 74.2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1143, "text": "Fig. 74.2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Gross Anatomy"}, {"text": "The pulmonary ligament is a double fold of the mediastinal pleura that tapers down from the root of the lung, where it is in continuity with the visceral pleura, to the caudal mediastinum.

It is also routinely divided to its superior border, the inferior pulmonary vein, when attempting to provide mobility to the lower lobe after resecting the upper or middle lobes. The lymph nodes within the pulmonary ligament are the level 9 nodes, which are N2 lymph nodes, and should be routinely harvested when performing a resection for lung cancer.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gross Anatomy"}, {"text": "The pleura has both mechanical and physiological functions. It transmits negative pressure from the thorax to the lung, thereby opposing the lung's natural elastic recoil and maintaining pulmonary expansion. During respiration, this function is performed in an environment of very low friction, thereby allowing the lungs to glide smoothly over the internal thoracic surfaces as they expand and contract. The pleura also controls the environment of the chest cavity by maintaining fluid homeostasis, preventing or removing air collections and keeping the space sterile. Under normal conditions, the pleural cavity is a potential space with a thickness ranging from 10 to 20f..Lm. The lung is maintained in an expanded state by the maintenance of negative pressure in the pleural space; this allows the expandable chest cavity to overcome the opposing forces exerted by the natural elastic recoil of the lung. The resting pressure in the pleural space, when the lung is at its functional residual capacity, is slightly negative at -2 to -5 cm H20. When measured in an upright posture, there is more negative pressure in the apex of the chest than at the diaphragm, likely a gravitational effect. The negative pressure continues to increase through inspiration, with the pressure ranging from -25 to -35 cm H20 at the vital capacity. Disorders that decrease the compliance of the lung or increase airway resistance further increase the negative pressure in the pleural space with inspiration. 5 ,9 Initially, it would seem curious that gas is not drawn out of solution into the pleural space by the negative pressure in the space. It is the lower partial pressure of gases on the venous side of the pleural circulation, as opposed to the arterial side, that prevents spontaneous pneumothorax from occurring under normal conditions. This difference in partial pressures between the two sides of the circulation is mainly a result of oxygen absorption. Unless the pressure in the pleural space decreases to significantly less than -SOcm H20, the sum total of the forces under normal conditions favors absorption of gas out of the pleural space.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1491, "end": 1495, "text": "5 ,9", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Physiology"}, {"text": "This diffusion gradient also accounts for reabsorption of gas that is introduced into the pleural space. The clearance rate of gases introduced into the pleural space is dependent on the concentrations of those gases with respect to their partial pressures in the pleural circulation. As the partial pressure of nitrogen is the greatest in the air we breathe, it therefore constitutes the highest partial pressure of the gases that form a pneumothorax. Nitrogen also has the highest partial pressure of the gases in our circulation; this can be decreased by altering the composition of inspired gases. Thus, administration of supplemental oxygen decreases the partial pressure of nitrogen in the bloodstream and thereby increases the nitrogen pressure gradient between the circulation and the pneumothorax, favoring more rapid reabsorption of the trapped gas. This relationship serves as the rationale for placing a patient on supplemental oxygen to facilitate reabsorption of a pneumothorax that is not being externally evacuated. 10 Under normal conditions, the pleural space contains very little fluid, estimated at approximately 0.3 mL/kg. The fluid is generally hypooncotic, with a protein content of approximately 1 g/dL. The mechanisms of fluid production and reabsorption are complicated and not completely understood. Numerous forces interact from both the parietal and visceral pleura, including their respective hydrostatic and on co tic pressures. Respiratory movement and gravity are both thought to have roles in maintaining the fluid dynamics of the pleural cavity. The predominant factor, however, is thought to be the uptake of fluid into the parietal pleural lymphatics. These lymphatics tend to be concentrated in the dependent portions of the chest cavity. Under normal conditions, this flow rate has been estimated at 0.1 to O.lSmL/kg/ h. The lymphatic flow rate has the capacity to increase and has been estimated to reach as high as 30mL/h, approximately 700mL/day in an average-size individual. When the dynamics of this equilibrium are unbalanced beyond the rate at which the lymphatics are able to compensate, pleural effusion accumulates. 7 ,9,11 It is interesting to note that the exact purpose of the pleura is still not fully understood. Empirically, it is clear that the pleura maintains fluid and gas homeostasis, mechanically couples the lungs to the bellows mechanism for respiration, and maintains sterility in its described space. To accomplish this, however, it is not clear how important it is to have the configuration of two opposing layers with a small amount of intervening fluid. It has been observed, for instance, that there is little change in pulmonary function tests in patients before and after fusion of the pleural space. 12 It is interesting to note that some mammals do not have a pleural space, similar to patients who have undergone pleurodesis, but that these animals clearly function normally. Thus, the exact necessity for having two pleural membranes defining a potential space remains somewhat of a mystery.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1032, "end": 1034, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2166, "end": 2173, "text": "7 ,9,11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2773, "end": 2775, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Physiology"}, {"text": "There are a large number of pleural disorders. The majority lead to symptoms as a result of mechanical compression of the lung, although many may be asymptomatic or may present with constitutional symptoms or pain. In most cases, the pathology results from the presence of something in the pleural space, which as previously described, is normally a potential space. Therefore, in an effort to organize this large number of disorders, they are grouped according to what abnormal phase of material is occupying the pleural space, that is, gas, liquid, or solid. When gas enters the pleural space, it is referred to as a pneumothorax. When liquid enters the pleural space, it may sometimes be broadly referred to as an exudative or transudative effusion but is frequently classified according to the type of liquid, such as hemothorax, chylothorax, or empyema. Last, solid masses may occupy the pleural space. Most benign masses are pleural plaques, but there are also rare benign tumors of the pleura, some of which may reach enormous size. Malignant masses of the pleura are usually cancers that have metastasized to the pleura, but there are also some rare primary tumors, most commonly mesothelioma. Sometimes, the groups may overlap, with more than one abnormal phase of material filling the pleural space. Such examples include air and blood, a hemopneumothorax, after trauma or air and pus, a hydropneumothorax, which may be seen with empyemas resulting from a bronchopleural fistula.

It conveys no protection from an ongoing leak or recurrence in the future . The procedure is performed in a manner similar to that used for decompressing a tension pneumothorax. After sterilely preparing the skin and infiltrating with a local anesthetic, a 16-or l8-gauge intravenous catheter is placed into the pleural space in the midclavicular line over the superior surface of the second rib. The needle is then withdrawn, and the catheter is connected to a short length of intravenous tubing capped with a threeway stopcock. A 60-mL syringe is then used to aspirate air from the chest cavity . When air can no longer be aspirated, the catheter is withdrawn, and the first chest x-ray is obtained.

Such tubes are generally placed under local anesthesia and sedation, employing sterile technique. Apical tubes, as employed for drainage of air, are best placed in the mid-or anterior axillary line in the third or fourth intercostal space. It is generally recommended to tunnel the tube subcutaneous up one interspace before entering the pleural cavity. The tunnel serves two purposes. First, it forms a flap valve that helps prevent entrance of air into the chest after the tube is removed. Second, the tunnel allows the surgeon to control the direction of the tube, anteriorly when placed for air or posteriorly when placed to drain fluid . The tube can then be placed for passive or active drainage. Passive drainage may be achieved by connecting the tube to a Heimlich flutter valve or waterseal on a Pleur-evac. For active drainage, most surgeons use a threebottle system ( Fig. 74 .31, generally unified as a commercially available unit such as Pleur-evac. Active drainage expedites and facilitates full expansion of the lung . Although also reported with passive drainage, the rare complication of reexpans ion pulmonary edema appears to be more common with active suction. 21 ,22 Generally viewed as a \"floor procedure,\" chest tube placement should be given all the consideration of a major operation. Although it can be performed with minimal discomfort, utilizing intravenous sedation and strategic local anesthesia, a chest tube placed by an inexperienced operator without expert supervision can be a horrific experience for a patient. In addition to the discomfort, chest tube placement may be accompanied by a number of complications including empyema, lung injury and bleeding, and death.\" Therefore, coagulation profiles and immunocompetency should be taken into consideration for all patients considered for this procedure . Intravenous analgesia, a short-acting benzodiazepine, or both should be used for an elective chest tube placement. Proper use of local anesthesia is critical for patient comfort during the procedure. The amount of local anesthetic that can be administered is limited by toxicity. A small amount of anesthetic is injected for the skin incision, and the remainder is accurately injected along the course of the tunnel that will be created to place the tube. This step allows the surgeon both to locate the superior surface of the rib and, by aspirating, to identify the parietal pleura. A small bolus of anesthesia can be injected at the level of the parietal pleura, and if adequate time is allowed after injection of the pleura, the discomfort of the tube placement can be limited to \"pressure\" and not sharp pain.
