Materials and Methods: The respiratory burst of PMNs was determined with luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) in resting cells and following N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or opsonized zymosan (OZ) stimulation and expressed in arbitrary CL units times assay-time (aU\u00d7min). The expressions of CD11b/CD18, CD10, and CD13 receptors were determined with flow cytometry. Results: Basal PMN CL was increased in HD patients to up to 1285\u00b1129 aU\u00d7min compared with 895\u00b188 aU\u00d7min in healthy controls (p<0.05). The CL of unprimed PMNs increased after fMLP stimulation from 3085\u00b1746 to 4529\u00b1808 aU\u00d7min, and after OZ stimulation from 12945\u00b11296 to 14678\u00b11355 aU\u00d7min. PMA-stimulated CL of PMNs was similar to control values. The oxidative burst in PMNs from HD patients and healthy controls was similar in response to TNF-\u03b1 alone. The CL of TNF-\u03b1-primed PMNs in HD patients was significantly lower than CL measured in healthy controls (p<0.05). The expressions of CD10 and CD13 metalloproteinase receptors were also increased (p<0.05). Although CD11b expression was significantly increased at rest and after fMLP stimulation, the expression of another \u03b2-integrin heterodimer compound, CD18, was not increased.

Chronic renal failure patients on maintenance hemodialysis present with diverse complications, including immune impairment [13] . Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are a crucial component of the immune response and play a major role in host defense through phagocytosis and the release of bactericidal enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [22, 32] . The profound alternations in inflammatory mediators and phagocyte activity in the uremic milieu are commonly related with detrimental immune defects in HD patients. These abnormalities in HD patients involve not only alterations in phagocyte cell signaling, impaired proliferation of PMNs, and altered regulatory interactions with T cells [11] , but also changes in the expressions of several genes, biologically relevant modifications of proteins, and accumulation of numerous uremic toxins. ROS generation depends mainly on the activity of the membrane-bound, multicomponent enzyme complex nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase and the myeloperoxidase (MPO) system. The oxidase functional assembly facilitates the transfer of an electron from cytosolic NADPH-oxidase to molecular oxygen to produce superoxide anion [24] . Bioactive cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, are involved in the regulation of NADPH-oxidase activity in PMNs [24] . TNF-\u03b1 priming of human PMNs plays a crucial role in many functions of these cells in vivo. TNF-\u03b1 leads to the release of large quantities of elastase from PMNs in the process of degranulation. TNF-\u03b1 activity is increased in uremia and correlates with ongoing decline of renal function [23] . PMN priming with TNF-\u03b1 or bacterial endotoxin, liposaccharide (LPS), leads to an exaggerated oxidative response to consecutive stimulation with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Interestingly, the increase in stimulated oxidative burst after fMLP stimulation correlated significantly with creatinine clearance in uremic patients [32] . TNF-\u03b1, through one of its kidney receptor subtypes, appears to be a key mediator of LPS-induced acute renal failure [6] . TNF-\u03b1 was shown to enhance respiratory burst and CD11b \u03b2 integrin expression in PMNs from healthy subjects [10] . The oxidative burst response is primed for increased response with TNF-\u03b1, and the up-regulation of fMLP receptors and CD11b closely correlate with the oxidative response. CD11b up-regulation was recently proposed to reflect cytokine-induced priming [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 60, "end": 64, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 139, "end": 143, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 269, "end": 273, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 492, "end": 496, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 497, "end": 500, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 842, "end": 846, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1346, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1478, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1770, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2116, "end": 2120, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2239, "end": 2242, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2352, "end": 2356, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2608, "end": 2612, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The precise molecular patchwork involved in PMN priming by TNF-\u03b1 is still being elucidated.

The CD11b/CD18 receptor (integrin \u03b22 complement receptor 3, CR3) interacts with iC3b complement factor and is involved in leukocyte chemotaxis, adhesion [37] , reactive species generation [30] , aggregation, and dialysisinduced neutropenia [25] .

CD10 is a single-chain glycoprotein with the properties of a neutral endopeptidase and a metalloproteinase, likely engaged in the inactivation of differentiation stimuli [31] .

Apparently, neutrophils in HD patients are chronically stimulated at baseline by high circulating TNF-\u03b1 levels and that this chronic stimulation makes them \"refractory\" to additional in vitro stimulation with TNF-\u03b1. An intracellular abnormality was, however, assumed to be a crucial factor underlying diminished TNF-\u03b1 priming [33] .

Our findings are supported by previous reports on CD11b expression, which was found to be increased approximately 3-fold and related with overall cellular activation during the HD procedure [15] . The \u03b1 (CD11b, and also CD11a, CD11c) and \u03b2 (CD18) chains of \u03b22 integrins form heterodimers and the CD18 number is presumed to be equal to the sum of \u03b1 chains. The disproportionate increase in CD11b without an increase in CD18 forming the CD11b/CD18 heterodimer on the PMN surface does not provide any straightforward conclusions on the protein stoichiometry, as CD18 forms heterodimers also with CD11a and CD11c. Indeed, similar patterns of increased CD11b expression without accompanying CD18 increase was previously reported in flow cytometry analysis [1] . Despite the transient changes in PMN surface phenotype, reportedly related to complement activation in the course of reversible PMN sequestration during HD with cuprophane membranes, the up-regulated expressions of CD10, CD13, and CD11b were permanent, even though other CD receptor types returned to baseline following initial down-or up-regulation, in addition to those unaffected by the HD session [26] . Our results, also from HD patients dialyzed with cuprophane membranes, on the increased expressions of CD10, CD13, and CD11b in HD patients prior to regularly scheduled HD session could imply that repeated HD sessions actually lead to a cumulative increase in PMN surface integrins. However, the magnitude of this increase and the enhancement of the expressions of these particular surface antigens cannot be compared with their increase during the session, probably due to other factors affecting PMNs such as complement activation, neutropenia itself, and the leukosequestration known to occur during HD sessions. Long-term up-regulation seems more credible considering that the expression of CD11b in PMNs was increased and unrelated with HD sessions in another study [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 488, "end": 492, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1052, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1460, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2234, "end": 2237, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The current evidence that TNF-\u03b1 priming of PMNs is down-regulated in HD patients, despite constitutive upregulation of resting cytotoxicity and the expressions of adhesion and peptidase receptors, may imply significant inefficiency of molecular or signaling events underlying TNF-\u03b1 priming in PMNs. This is the first study to demonstrate the contemporaneous abnormalities in phagocyte oxidative metabolism and the overexpression of surface receptors indicative of enhanced resting and agonist-elicited activity along with an impaired ability to respond to TNF-\u03b1 priming. However, the design of our experiments cannot definitively demonstrate whether the differences observed are a result of high-molecularweight uremic toxins or the dialysis procedure.
