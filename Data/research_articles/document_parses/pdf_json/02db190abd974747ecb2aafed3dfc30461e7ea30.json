Fomites can act as livevirus reservoirs for hours to days. 6 Breaking the cycle of infection is a critical goal. 7 Fortunately, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, an enveloped RNA virus, is highly susceptible to destruction with either alcohol-based hand sanitizers or simple soap and water when either is used during handwashing for at least 20 sec. 8 Furthermore, agents used for routine hospital cleaning are sufficient for decontaminating any potential fomite surface. 9, 10 Coronavirus disease has a spectrum of clinical presentations. Approximately 80% of those infected will have mild disease not requiring hospital care and 15% will have moderate disease requiring oxygen supplementation. Approximately 5% will have severe disease requiring hospitalization that may include intensive care unit admission, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. 11 Predicting how many Canadians will be infected is challenging. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and without strict social distancing or isolation, it is estimated that each person with COVID-19 disease will infect approximately two to three people (i.e., R 0 A = 2.2-3.6). 12 Similarly, the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 had an R 0 = 3 without control measures, which was successfully reduced to 0.4 with control measures. 13 For reference, the Spanish influenza pandemic in 1918 had an R 0 = 1.4-2.8, whereas seasonal influenza has an R 0 = 0.9-2.1.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 178, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 360, "end": 361, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 480, "end": 481, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 645, "end": 646, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 699, "end": 700, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 924, "end": 925, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1048, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1051, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1441, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1730, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1874, "end": 1876, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Initiatives to ''flatten the curve'' 14 are being implemented to prevent overwhelming healthcare systems through exponential disease growth.

The WHO defines droplets as [ 5 lm in diameter and airborne particles are defined as \\ 5 lm in diameter. 22 Specific characteristics of particles vary, with other sources defining airborne particles as\\5-10 lm or\\ 10 lm in diameter. 21 Airborne particles are also called droplet nuclei. 23 Droplets can be further subdivided into large droplets that fall to the ground or on surfaces within 0.3-0.9 m and small droplets that fall to the ground or on surfaces within 0.9-1.5 m. 23 For further information regarding respiratory secretions and their role in viral transmission patterns, the reader is referred to these useful reviews. 21, 24, 25 Droplets ([ 5-10 lm) fall on adjacent surfaces (people or surfaces/fomites) usually within 2 m from the patient's respiratory tract. 25 The main mechanism of SARS-SoV-2 transmission and resulting COVID-19 disease include close proximity to a patient's respiratory tract or via contact with fomites contaminated with droplets. 26 To provide a mechanical barrier to droplet spread (usually limited to within 2 m of the diseased person's respiratory tract), 25 it is advisable that every patient testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 don a regular surgical mask (not an N95 respirator). 27 Maintaining a [ 2 m distance from a patient with COVID-19 disease (i.e., just as with ''social distancing'') should also be practiced whenever possible. Droplet and contact PPE (described further in the text) should be donned for those providing any care inside the room of any suspected or confirmed patient with COVID-19 disease. 28 Aerosolized disease transmission is either by droplet or airborne particle transmission. 21 Aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) generate both airborne particles (\\ 5-10 lm) and both large and small droplets ([ 5-10 lm). 23 Accordingly, AGMPs performed on patients with acute respiratory infections are thought to substantially increase the risk of healthcare provider infection. 29 The risk of healthcare provider infection associated with various AGMPs during the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 can be found in a systematic review by Tran et al. 29 The exact role that airborne particles (\\ 5-10 lm) play in the spread of COVID-19 disease remains unclear. 30,31 Airborne particle transmission is more difficult to study compared with droplet transmission. 19 Nevertheless, in an elegant study by Yu et al., airborne particle transmission of SARS-CoV through a Hong Kong housing complex was shown to have occurred. 20 Although some procedures are well recognized as producing significant quantities of aerosols, others are thought to generate aerosols to a much lesser extent. 32 Many airway maneuvers, including bag-mask ventilation, tracheal intubation, and tracheostomy (and by logical extension, cricothyrotomy), are considered high-risk AGMPs (Table 1) . 29 The amount of aerosols generated from placement and use of a supraglottic airway is currently unknown. Because of the hazards of suspended aerosolized respiratory secretions in closed spaces where AGMPs have occurred, healthcare providers who must enter those spaces for patient care should use airborne, droplet, and contact PPE. 33 The time following the AGMP for which that airborne, droplet, and contact PPE would be required is determined by the time it takes to dissipate airborne particles. This amount of time is determined by a number of factors. The ''dose'' of airborne particles to be cleared will partly depend on the specific AGMP performed and the time taken to complete it. The number of air exchanges per hour of the patient's room is another major determinant ( Table 2) . 34 Whether the room is negative-or positivepressured will determine the path of egress for airborne particles, not necessarily the time for egress. ''One of the great things in emergency response and anyone who's involved in emergency response will know this, if you need to be right before you move you will never win. Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management. Speed trumps perfection and the problem in society we have at the moment is everyone is afraid of making a mistake. Everyone is afraid of the consequences of error, but the greatest error is not to move. The greatest error is to be paralyzed by the fear of failure.'' 35 Here, we review evidence regarding transmission of COVID-19 as well as research findings prior to the present Figure 1 Droplets vs airborne particles (also called droplet nuclei). 1. Large infectious droplets. These droplets are generally [ 60 lm in diameter. 21 Toilet water is noted here as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was shown to aerosolize in toilet water. 20 2. Small infectious droplets. These droplets are generally 10-60 lm in diameter. 21 3. Infectious droplet nuclei, also called airborne particles, are generally \\ 10 lm in diameter. 24 Coughing and sneezing tend to produce a spectrum of droplets, that vary in mean droplet size and number. For example, sneezing produces 4,000-4,600 droplets whereas coughing produces a few hundred droplets. 21 Room humidity, temperature, and air changes per hour contribute to determining droplet size. 24 Viral load and initial mean and distribution size of droplets are determined by the patient.

The primary studies tended to be small cohort or case-control studies with variable follow-up. As a result, some AGMPs have measures of association with wide 95% confidence intervals, reflecting the imprecision of what is currently known. Across multiple studies, the most consistent association with healthcare provider infection was tracheal intubation. 29 Table 1 contains examples of AGMPs that are known to be high-risk because of exposure to a high concentration of aerosols. Unfortunately, the risk of aerosol production is unknown for many AGMPs. Current airway management, including primary use of videolaryngoscopy, supraglottic device placement for rescue oxygenation, and the simplification of cricothyrotomy in ''can't intubate, can't oxygenate'' emergencies may play a role in changing these odds ratios during COVID-19 compared with SARS.

In a 2019 Cochrane review of PPE, double gloving was associated with less contamination than single gloving (relative risk, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.78). 40 It also allows the healthcare provider performing airway management to doff a heavily soiled pair of gloves without breaching their overall PPE.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 606, "end": 608, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 425, "end": 433, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Limiting the number of people in the room when a highrisk AGMP is taking place is critical as it reduces the number of people exposed and assists in preserving the PPE supply.

Neck protection helps decrease the droplet contamination shown to occur in this area. 38, 39 We recognize that neither neck nor head protection is included in the current WHO 15 or PHAC 37 guidelines for high-risk AGMPs. While the airway managers' wrists are easily decontaminated through requisite hand-washing both during and after the doffing procedure, the neck and head areas are not. The neck area has been identified as a zone of high contamination during simulated airway management AGMPs. 38, 39 While the head and neck do not contain mucous membranes, they are in close proximity above and below facial mucous membranes. If contaminated, these exposed areas could serve as a source of further contamination both during the PPE doffing process or afterwards during clothing removal. This is particularly true when removing other clothing in an over-the-head fashion (e.g., surgical scrubs or sports bras). Therefore, we propose head and neck covering, when done properly in a coordinated manner with other PPE equipment, could potentially reduce the risk of subsequent selfcontamination by reducing the amount of skin exposure and contamination at the outset while preforming high-risk AGMPs.

An automated chest compression device (e.g., LUCAS Chest Compression System; Stryker Medical, Portage, MN, USA) should be considered to decrease healthcare provider exposure. 45 Therefore, the minimum amount of PPE worn by all providers during cardiac arrest resuscitation should consist of airborne, droplet, and contact PPE.
