The patient responded well to combination chemotherapy. Only two cases of IVLBCL in which diffuse pulmonary FDG uptake was demonstrated have been reported previously. FDG-PET/CT plus random skin biopsy may be useful for the early diagnosis of IVLBCL with pulmonary involvement even without convincing radiological findings in the lung.",

            "text": "Recently, FDG-PET has been shown to provide high sensitivity for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) [8, 11, 15] . Several authors have reported that FDG-PET is useful for the diagnosis of IVLBCL when this type of lymphoma is clinically suspected [8, 16] . In our case, FDG-PET revealed strong FDG uptake in both lung fields. Although lymphoma cell involvement in the lung is frequently found in IVLBCL patients, in most cases, the lack of apparent radiological abnormalities in the lung does not prompt physicians to conduct a lung biopsy for the differential diagnosis. Even if respiratory symptoms do exist, physicians often hesitate to perform TBLB in the absence of convincing radiological findings in the lung field. Indeed, in the reported cases diagnosed as IVLBCL by lung biopsy, they exhibited apparent lung CT abnormalities [17] . On the other hand, in the three cases, including our case, FDG-PET was the only radiological examination that showed lung involvement of lymphoma cells. The data obtained by FDG-PET directed the two reported cases to the optimal biopsy site to obtain definitive histological confirmation. These three cases suggest that FDG-PET can make it easier for physicians to recognize the possibility of IVLBCL with lung involvement even in cases lacking radiological findings. That may encourage physicians to perform lung biopsies or random skin biopsies and may introduce quicker application of chemotherapy. Because it is now considered that systemic chemotherapy for IVLBCL at an early stage may increase survival [18] , some improvement in patient outcome may be expected. Shimada et al. [19] described renal biopsy findings of IVLBCL in two patients proven to be negative for renal FDG accumulation in their comparative study of FDG-PET and biopsy pathological findings in IVLBCL, reporting that FDG-PET is not necessarily useful for exploration in the kidney, unlike in the lung. Kotakle et al. mentioned that it remains unknown whether FDG-PET can detect IVLBCL even during periods when only subacute pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is shown [9] . In our case, however, PET/CT was performed on two separate occasions; PET/CT and chest CT images obtained 4 months before the rapid aggravation of the respiratory condition revealed no abnormality. In contrast, the PET/CT images obtained 2 months later revealed diffuse pulmonary FDG uptake; chest CT at this time still showed only slightly abnormal densities, limited to the apical lung regions, while the patient had no respiratory symptoms at all at that time. One month after the second series of imagings, a repeated CT of the chest revealed the new emergence of diffuse infiltrates in both lungs. On the other hand, there is a reported case in which IVLBCL was strongly suspected, despite the absence of abnormal accumulation of FDG in either lung field on FDG-PET. In that case, the patient presented with acute respiratory failure, and a random transbronchial lung biopsy showed findings indicative of pulmonary IVLBCL; R-CHOP therapy led to CR [20] . Thus, the temporal relationships among the development of respiratory failure symptoms, chest CT abnormalities, and PET/CT abnormalities appear to vary from case to case in patients with IVLBCL. We consider that it may be advisable for random transbronchial lung biopsies and random skin biopsies to be undertaken at an early stage in cases where IVLBCL is included in the differential diagnosis based on the FDG-PET/CT evidence of diffuse pulmonary FDG uptake even in the absence of respiratory symptoms, as in the case presented here. To assess the usefulness of FDG-PET in detecting IVLBCL with lung involvement, a study focusing on these issues is needed in the future.",
