            "text": "this paper utilizes critical Slowing Down (cSD; instability) indicators developed by statistical physics to analyse economic growth rate variability and secular stagnation in historical GDp data. Understanding these phenomena is vital, particularly in advanced economies faced with declining growth rates. two novel indicators -the autocorrelation (AR1) and the variance -are found particularly useful in providing insight into inter-decadal GDP variability over this period. These indicators are first applied to the Maddison-Project historical dataset, which includes almost a century of data for some 80 countries and almost two centuries of data for 9 countries. They are additionally applied to ~50 years of recent annual data for around 130 countries from the World Bank dataset as well as ~60 years of recent quarterly data for around 20 countries from the OECD dataset. Analysis reveals inter-decadal variability in growth cycles (the recession cycle), highlighting periods of large slow growth cycles and periods of small fast growth cycles. the most commonly occurring pattern is characterised by an increase in cSD from the 1900s to 1940s, a decline in CSD between the 1930s and the 1970s, then a further increase in CSD from the 1960s to 2010. This pattern is significant in ~70% of the advanced economies. CSD indicators may then provide invaluable insights into specific aspects of inter-decadal GDP variability, such as on the nature of the business cycle, secular stagnation and the implicit \"restoring forces\" of the economy.",

            "text": "The economic growth rate (as measured by the Gross Domestic Product or GDP) has declined across many advanced economies over recent decades 1-5 . Over the same period, GDP time series express a diverse range of annual to multi-decadal variability, commonly discussed in terms of recession cycles. Our understanding of how this variability in GDP has changed and its importance for long-run trends is poor. Novel analysis borrowed from the physical sciences may provide useful new insight. Our work is particularly motivated by an interest in the biophysical inputs to the economy and their role in the slowing down of economic growth 6-11 . The recent decline in economic growth is most apparent in the G7 block and is particularly prominent amongst USA, UK, Japan, Italy, France, and Germany, where the decadal averaged growth rates have dropped from around 4% in the 1970's to around 2% in recent years 5 . This decadal growth reduction is notably referred to as 'secular stagnation' by Summers (2013) 2 and in the literature 12 . It is perhaps most prominent in the case of Japan whose growth rate has moved from around 10% in 1970 to around 2% in 1990, remaining at around 2% thereafter. In addition in the most recent decade, even large emerging economies such as China and India have also experienced a steady decline in growth from around 10% in 2007 to around 7% in recent years.",

The suggestion of Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) 13 that public debt overhang is the main driver of stagnation appears to have played an important role in the initial government policy responses following the financial crisis of 2008.

Although multiple authors have analysed the relationship between the GDP growth rate and de-trended GDP variability, they have tended to focus on short timescale phenomenon (around 10 years). For example, Ramey and Ramey (1994) 27 and Hnatkovska and Loayza (2005) 28 , both provide evidence of a negative correlation between economic growth and its volatility. Reinhart and Reinhart (2015) 29 found a negative correlation between the magnitude of crises leading to a recession and the growth rate following a recession. Further analysis of long-term GDP variability is particularly timely not just in light of the continuing 'headwinds' widely associated with the financial crisis, but also because of growing concerns around economic instability associated with long-term policy issues such as climate change, resource depletion and biodiversity loss 6, 10 .

(2013) 35 have analysed variability in the 'information dissipation length' of interest rate swaps (IRS), finding early warning signals in the period leading to the Lehman Brothers collapse. Tan and Cheong (2014) 36 have analysed the dynamics of instability in the U.S. housing market. Furthermore, Diks Hommes and Wang (2015) 37 use the time-variability of variance and autocorrelation (auto-regression) to quantitatively the instability of financial indices. These novel techniques provide useful new insights. But they tend to deal with relatively short time-scales and mainly with financial indicators. Our aim in this paper is to employ stability indicators from the natural sciences to analysis, in particular, multi-decadal variability in the GDP. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ critical slowing down. Our analysis is based on the theory of Critical Slowing Down (CSD) in physical systems and on the use of the instability indicators (in particular, first order autoregressivity (AR1) and variance) employed by Diks Hommes and Wang (2015) 37 and others 38 . These are derived in their turn from the theoretical work of Wiessenfeld (1985) 39 and Wissel (1984) 40 . CSD theory is sufficiently general that it can be applied to any time-periodic system comprised of deterministic and stochastic components. CSD theory has been applied to a wide range of datasets in various fields of research, including Climate Physics 41 and Finance 37 ; however, CSD analysis has not been previously used to examine national macro datasets such as GDP. CSD analysis provides a measure of the change in the characteristics of variability as highlighted by spectral analysis and suggested by the literature [18] [19] [20] (Fig. 1 ). Preliminary work (by the authors) suggests that CSD behaviour may be present in GDP time-series ( Fig. 1) .",

Consider an object that is suspended between two springs, in a windy environment (the spring-object-spring system; Fig. 2a ). The springs provide a deterministic restoring force (black arrows), and the wind provides a series of stochastic perturbations. As the wind pushes the object away from its equilibrium position the springs pull the object back, leading the system to oscillate about its equilibrium. If the springs are strong (strong restoring), the oscillations are fast and small. If the springs are weak (weak restoring), the oscillations are slow and large. If the relative strength of the springs becomes weaker over time, then the oscillations of the system transition from small and fast to large and slow (Fig. 2b ).

The simplest correction for this is to express GDP variance as a percentage of the GDP (discussed below). Further www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ work is required to optimise this correction. The variance indicator is tested for significance using the same method as described for AR1 (see Methods). A positive (increasing) trend in the AR1 and variance indicators suggests that the oscillations of the system are changing from small and fast to large and slow. In other words, in a period of CSD, the typical time-period and magnitude of variability of the system is getting larger and the strength of the system's restoring forces are diminishing. CSD theory suggests that a tipping point is most likely to occur as the autocorrelation function approaches 1 42, 43 . At this point, the oscillations of the system are exceptionally large and slow and the system may change rapidly into a new state. However, the magnitude of AR1 is strongly affected by the method of de-trending and choice of calculation window. It is therefore suggested that trends in AR1 and variance are more insightful than the absolute magnitude of these variables 41 . The extended dataset, between 1820 and 2016, is available for USA, UK, Denmark, France, Italy, Holland, Sweden, Australia and Indonesia (Fig. 3) . These data highlight periods of high and low AR1 and variance, with typical time scales of 20-60 years. No clear internationally dominant pattern is apparent pre-1900. However, the early data for western European economies show a significant positive trend in AR1 between 1820 and 1950.",

It can be thought of as a state of weak restoration to the equilibrium growth path or a period where an economy takes a relatively long time to return to its equilibrium growth trend, following a perturbation. CSD theory suggests that a movement from a stable to an unstable state implies the onset of a 'critical transition' or tipping point 41 . However, a clear tipping point, following a period of CSD, is not apparent in any of the GDP time series examined in this study. Following K\u00e9fi et al.

It is evident therefore that great care must be taken in the interpretation of the results of analyzing the GDP using CSD instability indicators. It should be stated that the de-trending process before CSD analysis is non-trivial and the choice of timescale used to de-trend time series can greatly alter results. Previous empirical work such as spectral analysis (e.g. see methods), suggests that emphasising a 7-11 year timescale is unjustified. The application of a conventional 7-11 year timescale, for example, appears to remove information (see methods section).

This represents an exceptional exogenous shock that will likely drive a deep recession cycle of exactly the kind analysed in this manuscript. Our analysis indicates that, preceding the crisis many advanced economies were already in a state of high CSD characterised by large slow growth cycles (recession cycles). CSD theory then suggests that a post-coranavirus recovery could www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ be characterised by weak restoring forces and a slow return to equilibrium. On the one hand, this presents a clear threat to the structural stability of the global economy.

An optimal mitigation strategy for environmental challenges may lead to a decline in economic output, even if this is associated with higher wellbeing. Many authors have highlighted that a long run decline in GDP does not necessitate a decline in living standards, particularly for the high GDP per capita nations 8,60-62 . It is possible that aggressive climate change mitigation strategies aimed at achieving international climate targets will create a downward pressure on the GDP growth rates (Stern 2006; Jackson 2017 ). Regardless of this, climate change and biodiversity loss will inevitably lead to long-run declines or even a collapse in economic output if left unaddressed 6, 7, 63 . In summary, our understanding of the national and international dynamics of a declining political-economy is poor. It is clear that intensive research is required to inform long-term policy advice for the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ global challenges of the coming century. The use of instability indicators drawn from the natural sciences may well provide critical insights into that process.",
