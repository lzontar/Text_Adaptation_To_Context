Those slides coverslipped for more than 3 weeks needed 5 days to remove the coverslip without manipulation.The effects of destaining with HCl were assessed microscopically. Thin FNA smears required 10 minutes to achieve complete decoloration. Thick brain smears required HCl treatment for 15-20 minutes until complete bleaching was observed.Independent of blood content, endogenous peroxidase activity was completely removed when quenching the slides in 0.7% H 2 O 2 for 35 minutes, as seen in controls subjected to direct DAB treatments.Among unstained and noncoverslipped specimens (trial 6, n = 24), ICC for all markers provided good, reliable, and reproducible results with high intensity (median intensity score 2.neuronal nuclear antigen; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; MWT, microwave treatment. a Standard deviation. b Significant difference between with MWT and without MWT.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "Hot mount\" coverslipping did not have an impact on the ICC results (P = \u22650.47), while MWT in citrate buffer significantly increased the SI and cell specificity of all markers (P \u2264 0.03, Figure 2E)(Table 6). Therefore, the negative effects of SDS were exacerbated for all markers, and the GFAP immunostaining in trial 4 became even stronger than that on plain slides (CD3, SI, P = 0.06, CSS, P = 0.4; NeuN, SI, P = 0.5, CSS, P = 1.0; GFAP, SI, P = 0.007, CSS, P = 1.0).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "neuronal nuclear antigen; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; MWT, microwave treatment.

In this way, the cytologic context is preserved, and the information is not obscured by concomitant, nonrelevant cells such as contaminating blood cells.Previous studies and case reports have demonstrated the feasibility of subjecting cytologic, histologic, and histochemically stained slides, and immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization procedures, to second analyses.1,[11][12][13] These studies were mainly carried out after the removal of previous dyes by alcohol, bleaching with hydrogen chloride, or applying MWTs in citrate buffer and distilled water.2,14,31 Only a few investigators have performed direct immunolabeling of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and membranous antigens in neoplastic tissue smears previously stained with Papanicolaou, May-Gr\u00fcnwald Giemsa, and Diff-Quick stains that were not subjected to stain removal procedures.1,11,13,15,16 Romanowsky stains bind to cell components by electrostatic forces without causing conformational changes in the target epitopes.1,32 Thus, May-Gr\u00fcnwald Giemsa/Pappenheim, Hemacolor, Diff-Quick and, as seen in this study, modified Wright stains, exhibit a low risk of interference with immunodetection methods.1,11,13,14,32,33 It appears, however, that the lag period between cytologic staining and immunolabeling is a critical determinant. Published PSICC studies have documented successful immunostaining after a time period of as much as 10 years. Notably, all of these slides were coverslipped between the cytologic staining and the ICC procedures.13,14 Even in the absence of cytologic staining, antigenicity, and therefore, immunoreactivity have been reported to decrease after 4 weeks without coverslipping.34 If longer preservation is needed, it has been recommended to store the slides at \u221270\u00b0C.35,36 Now, as seen in this study, even cytologic staining appears to accelerate the decay of immunoreactivity. After only 1 week, immunopositivity for cellular markers decreased significantly. Similar to the experiments mentioned above, immediate coverslipping shielded vulnerable stained films from detrimental environmental factors. In this study, we showed that the decay of antigenicity was directly associated with exposure to dye and not with the destaining procedure compared with unstained coverslipped slides.Without coverslipping, ionic dye components appear to facilitate cellular biomolecule degradation by oxidative stress and other less known pathways.37 If a slide was sealed under a lid using a xylenebased mounting medium, the decrease in antigenicity was significantly lower but still identifiable. However, initial immunoreactivity up to the levels of fresh plain slides could be reestablished if the previously stained slides underwent MWT in citrate buffer after decoverslipping, destaining, and rehydrating.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "Even though observations were made in a substatistical number of samples in this study, our results provide evidence that viral antigen labeling in ICC can be more sensitive to interference with other laboratory procedures than cellular antigen labeling. Consequently, this liability has to be considered and tested if pathogen-specific ICC is to be carried out on sparse sample volumes. In summary, PSICC is an easy, sensitive, reliable, and reproducible method for the immediate evaluation of selected markers in Romanowsky-stained cells. Cytologic staining, on the other hand, can rapidly decrease antigenicity if left uncoverslipped. Any further cellular antigen decay can be counteracted by performing MWTs prior to immunolabeling. Viral epitopes, however, might require dedicated preservation techniques. In this study, all pretreatments abolished the ICC results", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
