G-CSF not only increases neutrophil counts, but also enhances and primes many neutrophil functions. It is widely used in cancer patients to hasten recovery from chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and to mobilise peripheral blood progenitor cells for bone marrow transplantation [2, 3, 4, 5] . G-CSF has proved safe and effective when used for longer periods in patients with druginduced neutropenia, particularly following solid organ transplantation [6] . The prevention or curtailing of cytotoxic drug-induced neutropenia is ascribable to quantita-tive stimulation of granulopoiesis by G-CSF. In patients with lymphoma and even leukaemia or solid tumours, G-CSF not only shortens the duration of neutropenia, thus providing higher complete remission rates and longer disease-free survival, but also reduces the incidence of infectious episodes ( about half reduction of febrile neutropenia) [7, 8] .

All these effects have been demonstrated mainly on blood neutrophils from healthy volunteers. G-CSF effects are mediated via specific receptors whose number on the neutrophil membrane is subjected to regulation by microbial products and cytokines [11, 12] . Furthermore, intracellular events induced by G-CSF [13] are modulated by the effects of other mediators. Consequently, G-CSF effects are probably influenced by the local environment (e.g., the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance). Monocytes/macrophages also carry G-CSF receptors [14] and their functions, including cytokine synthesis, are sensitive to G-CSF. Few studies have investigated G-CSF effects on isolated monocytes/macrophages. A pro-inflammatory effect or an anti-inflammatory effect of G-CSF on monocytes has been suggested based on the influence of G-CSF on the cytokine balance [13] .
