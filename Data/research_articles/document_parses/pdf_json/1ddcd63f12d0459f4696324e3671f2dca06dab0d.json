Upon infection, SARS CoV-2 enters respiratory epithelial cells and type-2 pneumocytes and induces a secondary immune response which may be associated with cytokine storm, leading to an ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) like picture [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Strategies to attenuate the severity of the inflammatory response have included the use of the Interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody (ex. tocilizumab) [6] [7] [8] . Due to the signal transduction role that the JAK-STAT pathway plays in mediating Immune-effector cell activation, there has been interest in pursuing inhibitors of this pathway as potential therapeutic agents in mitigating COVID19-associated lung inflammation 9, 10 . We recently diagnosed COVID19 infection in a patient who was on oral ruxolitinib for management of graft-vs-host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplant and report on his presentation and the evolution of his clinical course.",

His history is notable for angioimmunoblastic T Cell lymphoma treated initially with EPOCH chemotherapy resulting in a complete remission. He then underwent autologous stem cell transplant (October 2017). He relapsed in June 2018 and was treated with tipifarnib on a Phase II clinical trial. He attained a second complete clinical remission and underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant from a 10/10 matched unrelated donor in October 2018. Five months later (March 2019) he developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) with skin and myofascial involvement and was treated with prednisone and extracorporeal photopheresis. He continued to be symptomatic, and ruxolitinib was added in October 2019. Steroids were tapered after two months and ruxolitinib 10 mg BID was continued in combination with photopheresis every other week (last session prior to admission). The most recent CD4+ cell count was 593/\u00b5l. He had recently been admitted (3 weeks prior to admission) for human metapneumovirus infection and had recovered. He denied exposure to anyone with COVID-19.",

On arrival, his temperature was 99.6 degrees Fahrenheit, RR18, O2 96% on room air, he was speaking in full sentences and breathing comfortably. His lungs were clear to auscultation. A CDC-based RT-PCR assay targeting N1 and N2 of SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene was negative on a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and he was admitted for fever work up. The nasopharyngeal respiratory virus swab was negative. His chest x-ray on admission demonstrated no opacities. The following day the patient continued to have a persistent dry cough and chest CT was obtained to evaluate for possible interstitial disease or lung GVHD. Chest CT as shown in Figure  2 demonstrated new subtle patchy ground glass opacities and diffuse centrilobular ground glass nodules which are a nonspecific finding but the main differential diagnostic considerations in this clinical setting include infection (particularly viral or opportunistic) versus lung inflammation (drug toxicity or hypersensitivity pneumonitis) .

Of interest is that the initial RT-PCR test for SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR was negative but a repeat test returned positive 24 hours later with a low viral load. False negative tests have been reported, and explanations include sampling error, poor test sensitivity, low viral load, or variable viral shedding in the upper airway, especially in patients who present with lower respiratory tract disease. Of note, sputum or BAL are more sensitive for diagnosing lower respiratory tract disease but are often not available for testing.

            "text": "Ruxolitinib is an orally bioavailable Janus-associated kinase (JAK) inhibitor which binds to and inhibits protein tyrosine kinases JAK 1 and 2, leading to reduction in inflammatory responses. [12] [13] [14] [15] The JAK-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway is involved in cellular proliferation, hematopoiesis, and the immune responses in inflammatory diseases. Cellular targets of ruxolitinib are seen in both innate and adaptive immunity. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and steroid refractory acute graft-vs-host disease associated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Ruxolitinib is under study as therapy for chronic GVHD and is used commonly for this disorder due to its tolerability and anti-inflammatory effects. In a study of hepatic inflammation, ruxolitinib was shown to repress CRP by targeting the IL6/JAK/STAT signaling pathway 21 Recent data has shown that ruxolitinib may also led to infectious complications and therefore may potentially be detrimental in the setting of COVID. Sylvine et al reported infectious complications with ruxolitinib from the French Pharmacovigilance Database. 22 Of 30 infections reported in 26 patients, 20% were herpes zoster, 5 were mycobacterial, and 4 were fungal. Due to its demonstrated anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities, a clinical trial of ruxolitinib along with standard of care is planned to treat patients with inflammatory pneumonia due to COVID19 (. NCT04338958). Results from the planned prospective trial should further enhance our understanding of the risks of secondary infections associated with JAK-STAT inhibitors based on their perceived myelosuppressive and immune-suppressive effects. Supplemental correlative studies will offer additional evidence on changes in host immune tolerance/effector responses and predictors of favorable outcomes with ruxolitinib in the fight against COVID associated inflammation.",

Our patient was 17 months post stem cell transplantation and was maintained on the JAK/STAT inhibitor ruxolitinib, a proposed novel therapy for SARS CoV-2 pneumonia, throughout his clinical course with successful attenuation of symptoms. While there are a number of biomodulatory agents used for immunosuppression in the setting of organ and stem cell transplantation and autoimmune disorders, there is little available data to date on their impact on coronavirus infection and inflammatory response, nor is there data regarding underlying immunosuppressed state due to transplant or other disorders and the clinical course of COVID infection.",

            "text": "Recommendations on how to manage immunosuppression agents in allogeneic transplant patients who are infected with SARS CoV-2 have not been clearly established. As of June 2020, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research reported 192 cases of SARS CoV-2 in transplant recipients, 110 of which had allogeneic transplants 23 . Of these, the majority occurred in the first 3 years after transplant and 81 patients have either resolved or improved. With agents like ruxolitinib whose mechanism of action may reduce SARS CoV-2 related complications, it may be prudent to consider continuing therapy, but alternatively in significantly immunocompromised patients, reduction of immunosuppression may be appropriate. Until data is available regarding immunosuppression agents used and T cell subset recovery from registries such as the CIBMTR, clear guidelines regarding management of COVID in post-allogeneic transplant patients on immunosuppression may remain anecdotal. As we learn more about the relevance of different pathways and host effector mechanism in COVID immune response, a rational strategy for the use of agents such as ruxolitinib can be defined. . Axial (A) and coronal (B) images from the patient's chest CT demonstrate diffuse centrilobular ground glass nodules (circles) as well as subtle, patchy ground glass opacity in the right upper lobe (arrows). These findings are nonspecific but typically seen in the setting of infectious (such as viral or opportunistic infections) or inflammatory disorders (such as drug toxicity or hypersensitivity pneumonitis) and have an indeterminate appearance for COVID-19 pneumonia.",
