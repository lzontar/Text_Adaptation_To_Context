[2] [3] [4] [5] However such evidence has been obtained from cities with different living conditions than the ones prevailing among slum dwellers of Latin American cities and can hardly be extrapolated to them. [6] Buenos Aires City (CABA) has nearly 3 million inhabitants, of whom approximately 5.7% live within 17 neighborhoods with a very vulnerable population. In most cases, there are households with scarce water and sanitation, poor ventilation, space constraints and overcrowding making physical distancing and self-quarantine impractical, thus facilitating the rapid spread of SARS-CoV2 infection. [7] [8] Barrio Mugica is one of the most overcrowded slums with more than 40.000 inhabitants, and almost 1500 people experiencing homelessness. [9] Its first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, linked to community transmission, was reported four days after national mandatory quarantine was set on March,19 th 2020. Preventive measures were taught to community-based organizations that provided food assistance, temporary isolation centers for elderly people in churches were created and an immediate plan for emergency and health care was established in the three medical centers allocated in Barrio Mugica. In spite of these measures, in the following days this slum was the first in Argentina to become affected by a high number of cases, with a sharp rise of infected people.",

The expansion factors at the household level imply three types of adjustments. The first one is related with non-response (given that some households did not want to answer the survey); the second one corresponds to the projection of sample to the entire population, and the third one to calibration techniques with a final adjustment by groups of age and gender, using external information from population census. [13] Therefore, calibration variables were people 14 year-old or more, grouped by sex and by intervals of age: 14-30; 31-45; 46-59; 60 and more. 6 As household members share exposure to SARS-CoV2, the outcome (prevalence of SARS-CoV2 IgG) should show some correlation within the household. To test clustering effect, a random effects logistic regression model (multilevel model) was applied as it includes the variation between clusters explicitly in the likelihood and therefore takes account of intracluster correlation. [14] [15] [16] The estimate (measure of between households variation) and rho (measure the within-household correlations) were obtained. To test the null hypothesis of no within-household clustering (rho=0) a likelihood ratio test (LRT) was performed comparing the log-likelihood of common logistic regression (in which =0 and rho=0) with that for the random effect model.",
