The family of one patient expressed reluctance to seek care due to fear of COVID-19 exposure. The other four patient families had repeated contact with the healthcare system prior to ultimate diagnosis. This suggests that healthcare system factors may play a role, including decreased referrals to emergency departments or laboratories, and transition to alternative evaluation methods such as telemedicine. Diagnostic bias may also occur, since pre-senting signs of malignancy (fever, malaise, and respiratory symptoms) can initially be mistaken for symptoms of COVID-19. Furthermore, endemic areas have reported that children are less likely to become critically ill from COVID-19 disease as compared with adults, 3 which may delay referral of children for emergency services or laboratory studies.",

Telemedicine utilization among primary and acute care providers is increasing during the pandemic. 4 The limitations of telemedicine, including lack of ability to detect critical physical exam findings such as unstable vital signs, pallor, and hepatosplenomegaly, are underscored by these cases. For example, after two telehealth visits and one visual assessment outside the primary care provider's office, patient 1 re-presented hours later to a local emergency department with overwhelming sepsis that progressed to cardiac arrest and brain death. Such an outcome is particularly difficult given the extremely favorable prognosis of childhood ALL. Indeed, the pediatric cancer diagnoses presented here are highly curable in North America with expected cure rates ranging from 67% to over 95% depending on diagnosis. 5 These cases illustrate the indirect impact of this pandemic on morbidity in COVID-19-negative patients for whom care delays can be fatal. We highlight the unintended consequences of a pandemictransformed healthcare system for a vulnerable pediatric population.",
