Education among the patients about the use of SMBG and its importance are usually done on every visit of the patient to the clinic. From this study, we highlight the need for regular SMBG especially among patients with diabetes on insulin therapy during periods of pandemic when there is lockdown. Patients must be educated more on this aspect to keep their diabetes under control and avoid any hypoglycaemia 8, 9, 10 . It was note worthy that many people reported that they were able to keep them physically active and were able to maintain good dietary compliance probably due to the fact that they had more time to do these two important aspects of Diabetes management.
