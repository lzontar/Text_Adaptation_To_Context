The discovery of COVID-19 was linked to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China. As of February 27, 2020, there have been 82 294 confirmed cases globally with the first case in New Zealand. 1 This constitutes an import risk to neighboring Pacific Island countries including Samoa, which as on February 28, 2020, had no confirmed case of COVID-19.",

This is imperative considering the extent of spread and rapidity of virus transmission, especially among vulnerable populations. The rise of COVID-19 brought back the horror of the last measles epidemic in Samoa and some Pacific Island countries. The gradual decline in the measles epidemic trend was met with a sedulous approach toward case diagnoses, detection, and confirmation. It further stresses the importance of having well-equipped state-of-theart diagnostic health facilities, public health disease control centers, and highly trained infectious disease personnel. This is a necessity for early disease detection and diagnosis to prevent the occurrence of an epidemic of COVID-19 in Samoa.",

The COVID-19 Joint Incident Management Team (IMT), coordinated by the WHO office in the Pacific, has developed and is implementing a 6-month Pacific Action Plan for COVID-19 Preparedness and Response. 2 The successful implementation of this action plan is determined by many factors in individual countries, and it mostly involves a cohesive teamwork between the local Ministry of Health and the Joint IMT composed of representatives from WHO and regional donor partners such as Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), Pacific Community (SPC), and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). 2 The establishment and activation of Samoa's Health Emergency Operations Centre (HEOC) through the Ministry of Health (MOH) is a step forward for Samoa in preparation for COVID-19 to enhance health sector surveillance, coordination, and provision of situational analysis updates.",
