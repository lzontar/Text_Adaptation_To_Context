The massive data is in need of efficient tools and intermediates for its management, analysis, visualization, and communication [3] . Web-based information systems (IS) serve as one-stop platforms to access, analyze, and explore information effectively for decision-making purposes [4] [5] . Although current systems are proved to be successful to communicate and analyze data efficiently, they still suffer from the complexity and the higher learning curves due to the limitations of conventional interaction methods [6] . Users of information systems (e.g. public, workers, managers, decision makers, organizational leaders) often look for a certain piece of knowledge for which they may have to master the functionalities and resources provided by the IS [7] . This is especially tedious and discouraging for users who are not continuous visitors to the system. Thus, modern approaches are needed to free the users from the nuances and complexities of information systems and provide a feasible tool to access knowledge [8] .",

            "text": "With the advancements in artificial intelligence, there is a significant surge in research of chatbots, which can be defined as intelligent agents (i.e. assistants) that have the ability to comprehend natural language queries and pro-duce a direct and factual response utilizing data and service providers [9] . More recently, the increased prevalence of deep learning tools and generalized algorithms resulted in the growth of chatbots fueled from deep learning's ability to make robust and scalable inferences out of highdimensional and likely noisy data [10] . Technology companies have been taking the lead on operational virtual assistants integrated into their ecosystem which triggered a brand new and massive market that was valued at US$ 2.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach US$ 11.3 billion by 2024 [11] . However, the usage of chatbots for effective and reliable information communication is not widespread among public, government, and scientific communities [12] . As of 2018, only 16% of Internet users have ever used a chatbot [13] despite the fact that there is a substantial demand [14] . Several publications emphasize the potential chatbots hold to serve as the next generation information communication tool and make the case for an urgent need for chatbot development and adoption in their respective fields [15] [16] . The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Institute for Water Resources reports that virtual assistants hold great promise for the USACE to better serve the public, enhance workflow, and improve decision-making while saving time and financial resources [17] . More recently, the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic made it clear that chatbots will be instrumental in cases where accurate information needs to be communicated to a substantial group of people with different backgrounds and technological resources as reported in a Nature article [18] . Sohrabi et al. [19] describes how artificial intelligence-powered chatbots can be widely used to provide up-to-date information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak in the context of prevention and management.",

One of the major obstacles of virtual assistant development and utilization is that the available services usually require a centralized data flow (e.g. server-side processing of voice, sentence, or data) involving a third-party service provider which presents concerns in terms of data privacy, security, and compatibility [21] . Currently available frameworks for chatbot development often employ vertical integration in which the developer founds themselves stuck with the ecosystem of the service provider [22] . A 2019 report on the virtual personal assistant market concludes that the high-growth inflection point of the market and wide adoption of smart assistants in many fields will occur as open-source and free assistant development tools [22] . A second major challenge is the workforce and / or financial resources required to initialize and maintain a chatbot discourages establishments, governments, research groups, and non-profits, while for larger companies and organizations these costs justify themselves for the long term [23] . Furthermore, active internet connection is often needed for chatbot to operate at its simplest level, which presents a significant setback as many use cases do not have a reliable and consistent internet connection [17] .",

Web Components are a collection of web technologies combined with the purpose of creating reusable, customizable, and encapsulated HTML elements [25] . It is mainly powered by three web technologies. Custom Elements enables the creation of new HTML elements. HTML templates offer the mechanism to define HTML content that can be instantiated during runtime instead of getting rendered when the page is loaded. Shadow DOM provides encapsulation of an element's features with a shadow tree associated with the web component [26] . The major consideration when designing the component is to prevent it to affect the visual and functional integrity of the hosting web site, as well as to prevent it from getting affected by the hosting web site. Shadow DOM prevents potential integration complications by creating a shadow root under the custom HTML element and rendering it separately from the main document DOM. These new technologies are not yet widely adopted in the industry and especially in academia despite the remarkable benefits they offer. Another aim of this paper is to serve as an example to advantages of Web Components by reducing the technicality.",

Both same-origin and cross-origin addresses are accepted given that the FAQ pages, that are not hosted in the same domain as the application, are navigated via a proxy server. The strength of the FAQ parsing and Q&A extraction comes from its unique design where no preprocessing is required regarding the webpage structure. Heuristic algorithms can perform just as well or better than machine learning approaches for similar scraping tasks as reported in the literature [29] . Our novel heuristic algorithm is built on the basis of two assumptions concerning the structure of the FAQ webpage: 1) the majority of question mark characters belong to the FAQ on a given page, and 2) both the questions and answers follow a certain HTML structure (i.e. not arbitrarily placed). The first assumption is clearly the case for the majority, if not all, of the FAQ pages since most FAQ questions end with a question mark and it is extremely unlikely to have more question marks in the remaining of the page. As for the second assumption, all questions in a given FAQ webpage is highly likely to follow a certain convention for the purpose of clarity, symmetry, maintainability, and effectiveness. More concretely, the HTML elements containing the FAQ question will likely share certain characteristics such as element tag, class, styling, immediate parents, and DOM depth. Thus, a pattern can be inferred by analyzing these correlations in an efficient way. The same condition is applicable for the FAQ answers.",

Per our assumption, the majority of these question marks should belong to FAQ questions. To deduce a pattern, we traverse each retrieved element to keep record of their and their closest three parents, if exist, tag names along with their depth within the DOM tree. Per our symmetry assumption, the elements containing FAQ questions should produce the same values for tag names and depth. Using a hash table, the frequency of each combination is measured to identify the correct pattern. Thus, all FAQ questions are successfully retrieved based on the inferred pattern. Before initiating the process for parsing the FAQ answers, a challenge arises regarding the scope. For example, the innermost element containing the question might have parent elements for visual and interactive purposes (e.g. buttons, container boxes) before continuing to the following question or answer. It is known that the answer to a question lies somewhere between the text of that question and the text of next question. However, it cannot be known whether the answer is grouped with its question: <div id=\"questionGroup1\"> <div id=\"question1Container\">...</div> <div id=\"answer1Container\">...</div> </div> or simply have been coded sequentially in the same scope with other questions and answers: <div id=\"question1Container\">...</div> <div id=\"answer1Container\">...</div> Even if processing would have been performed to find the uppermost parent containing only the question text, scope issues still would not fully resolve since it is a common practice in FAQ pages to group questions by topic, which breaks the sibling relationship between the last question in a group and the first question in the next group. As a solution, a heuristic approach is taken to deduce a pattern to work in all possible webpage configurations. First, the uppermost parent of each question that does not contain its following question is retrieved, and its distance to the child is recorded. Per the symmetry assumption, the majority of retrievals will share the same distance value. Thus, the system is able to extract all answers regardless of their scope and structuring. Thus, all Q&A pairs are extracted from an FAQ webpage in a heuristic manner requiring no data other than the URL of the Q&A page.",

Furthermore, this representation will only be used to calculate similarity between different question sentences, and thus, natural language parsing and data extraction is not a necessity. An additional design choice is to be able to efficiently perform the encoding process on the client-side. Given these requirements, the Instant Expert utilizes the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) [31] , a model that is designed to embed text to produce a vector representation entailing the semantic information within the sentence. More specifically, the Transformer architecture [32] constitutes the underlying encoding model for context-aware representations of words resulting in a 512-dimensional vector. Within the presented framework, a lightweight version of the USE with an 8,000-word vocabulary is imported and executed with TensorFlow.js, an open-source JavaScript library that can train and deploy machine learning models on the client-side via the browser.",

Once the processing is complete, the tensor matrix as well as the list of Q&A pairs are saved within the duration of the session. If the developer enabled downloadModel attribute of the Instant Expert web component, then the framework will generate a JSON file consisting of the tensor matrix and the Q&A pairs. This JSON file can be hosted on a server and the URL to access the file can be provided to Instant Expert. This mechanism allows the developers to prevent the client's hardware resources to unnecessarily be used by the embedding process, and make the Instant Expert instance to be initialized instantly to respond to any questions without needing to wait for the asynchronous operations to be completed.

Due to the cross-origin limitations, a proxy server (CORS Anywhere) has been utilized to retrieve the webpage contents. Exactly all 119 Q&A items on the CDC page have successfully been extracted with a 100% precision and recall, followed by the embedding of all questions for natural language mapping. The average time spent on parsing the Q&A pairs and for embedding the questions using the Universal Sentence Encoder has been reported in Figure 4 . In order to visualize the processing complexity, this benchmark has been performed for subsets of the CDC questions so that the correlation between the number of questions and the processing time is clear. The runtime measurement does not include the time spent for the retrieval of the FAQ page via GET request and loading the USE model as both of their performance is out of the presented framework's scope and affected by external parameters such as the internet speed. Furthermore, these actions are only performed once, and thus, is neither related to the number of questions nor the structure of the FAQ page. One of the main purposes of the FAQ Mode is to allow users to ask questions in various natural language expressions. A test set is generated to quantify how flexible the Instant Expert is in terms of accurately mapping question variations that share the same intent. The test set contains the original FAQ question, answer, and one natural language question that expects the same answer with different phrasing. For objectivity, a third-party software (i.e. QuillBot), which is a machine learning-powered paraphraser and sentence restructurer, is utilized to produce high-variance natural language questions with a similar meaning to the original. Minor manual modifications have been made to questions in order to challenge the inference component of the system by referencing the actual questions asked by people on the internet. Table 1 provides examples of the generated questions in comparison to the original question. Additionally, the test set also contains three questions that the CDC's FAQ cannot and should not answer. These three questions are taken from the US Federal Drug Administration's (FDA) FAQ webpage. The reason for this addition is to make sure that the chatbot does not disseminate inaccurate and unrelated information. Thus, the test contains a total of 122 questions. For measurements, a benchmark analysis has been carried out to experiment with a broad range of confidence threshold values with respect to the precision and recall values. For reference, precision represents the percentage of questions that have been mapped to the correct answer out of all the questions that are mapped to some answer. Recall, on the other hand, represents the percentage of questions that have been accurately mapped. Both the benchmark code and a complete test set can be found on the GitHub repository for reproducibility and reanalysis.",

Figure 5 shows how precision and recall values are affected based on the selected confidence threshold. To achieve an accurate and complete system, the goal is to maximize the precision and recall values, however, a trade-off evaluation is required [42] . Based on the use case, it may be important to maximize the precision for making sure to always provide the accurate answer for questions that are mapped or to maximize recall for mapping as much question as possible while potentially sacrificing the accuracy of a few. For this use case, the recall starts to drastically decrease around confidence level of 0.8 while the precision stabilizes as seen on Figure 5 . Looking at a confidence level of 0.75, the precision is maximized with a value of 100% while recall value is 97.541%. Coincidently, the ideal confidence value for the highest possible recall is also observed to be 0.75, though for other cases this value might differ resulting in a trade-off to prioritize either maximum precision or recall. This ideal confidence level can also be observed with the harmonic mean of precision and recall values (i.e. f1-score) where f1-score is the highest at 0.75 confidence. For applications when the prediction results in critical information regarding human health, such as the use case for COVID-19, precision is more critical than recall. Because, providing the wrong information can have detrimental results. Thus, based on the experiment, the confidence threshold is set to 0.75 by default to ensure perfect precision of 100%, which results in 3 out of 119 questions are left unmapped. These three questions are examined to identify why they have not reached to satisfactory confidences. Table 2 summarizes the original FAQ text, the test question, and commentary on why the mapping was not successful. Based on the investigation, we conclude the questions that are not context-independent and not wellstructured are more difficult to be mapped from to-thepoint questions that an average user of the system might ask.",

The output of the parsing component has been recorded and analyzed to measure the success rate. In this context, precision represents the number of the accurate text groups that were labeled as a question or an answer, whereas, the recall represents out of all the question and answers on the given webpage the framework was able to accurately parse.
