Multivariate adjusted hazard ratio of 60-day in-hospital death across patient strata. Strata in a (upper) have comparable values of driving pressure, but increasing values of mechanical power across strata. HR for each stratum is presented below. b Has comparable values of mechanical power, but increasing values of driving pressure across strata.
