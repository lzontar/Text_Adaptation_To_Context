HCV is thought to bind heparin sulfate glycoaminoglycans and the LDL receptor at the sinusoidal surface of the hepatocyte as the virus passes through the bloodstream before interacting with the CD81 and SB-RI co-receptors, which are engaged by the viral E1/E2 glycoproteins. 20 Although claudin-1 is considered a tight junction molecule, its interactions with CD81 have been shown to occur at the sinusoidal membrane. 21 The hepatocyte tight junction is inaccessible to HCV directly in polarized cells, 22 and the mechanism by which HCV accesses coreceptors within the tight junction complex remains controversial. The complex orchestration of HCV coreceptors during HCV binding and entry suggests that dysregulation of the coreceptor interaction process offers a prime therapeutic strategy to suppress HCV infection.",

Huh7 cells stably transfected with IFITM1-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (TRCN0000057502; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or nontargeting vector shRNA (SHC002; Sigma) were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 lg/mL puromycin.

The cultureadapted HCV-SJ will be described in a subsequent report.

We also assessed IFITM1 expression in vivo in liver tissue from HCVinfected patients. After 24 hours of IFN-a therapy, high levels of IFITM1 induction in liver tissue from chronically infected patients correlated strongly with favorable therapeutic outcome of viral load suppression (Fig. 1B) . The highest induction of IFITM1 was detected in patients with rapid virologic response to combination pegylated IFN and ribavirin therapy (rapid virologic response: undetectable serum HCV RNA by week 4 of therapy), followed by those with early virologic responses (complete early virologic response: undetectable serum HCV by week 12 of therapy; partial early virologic response: greater than 2 log 10 IU/mL reduction in but not complete loss of HCV RNA by week 12 of therapy). Nonresponders were patients in which HCV serum RNA dropped by less than 2 log 10 IU/mL by week 12 and was still detectable by week 24 of therapy. IFITM2 and IFITM3 are family members of IFITM1 that are highly related to each other but divergent at the N and C termini from IFITM1. 25 IFITM2 and IFITM3 were also induced in rapid virologic response and early virologic response patients but not nonresponders, although we focused this study on the effects of IFITM1.

We next tested HCV focus formation on IFITM1-expressing cultures using confocal microscopy. As expected, IFITM1 expression limited the total number of HCV-infected foci (Supporting Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, for the foci that did form on Huh7-IFITM1 cells, fewer cells were infected per focus compared with those in vector-control samples (Figs. 3E, F).

The known interaction of IFITM1 with the HCV coreceptor CD81 suggests that IFITM1 could alter the function of one or more HCV receptors and inhibit the entry process. We determined that pseudoparticles enveloped with HCV glycoproteins were significantly reduced in their ability to enter Huh7-IFITM1 compared with Huh7-vector cells (Fig. 4A ). In contrast, VSV and MLV pseudoparticles were not significantly reduced in the presence of IFITM1 (Fig.  4A) . While this result indicates that IFITM1 reduces HCV entry, the effect is not as strong as expected by the earlier reduction of HCV infection itself. To more carefully examine HCV binding and entry, we tested each stage with actual infectious virus. To determine whether IFITM1 inhibited HCV binding to or entry into host cells, Huh7 cells were incubated with HCV virions at 4 C and thereafter unbound virus was washed away. HCV RNA collected at this point represents HCV bound to the cell surface. 26 After virus binding, cells were shifted to 37 C to allow HCV entry to proceed. After 4 hours the HCV virions that remained on the cell surface were stripped off by proteinase K treatment of cells, and therefore the HCV RNA collected at this point represents only cell-internalized virus. As a negative control of virus binding and entry, we included a parallel assessment of cells treated with neutralizing anti-CD81 antibody. 27 Expression of IFITM1 did not significantly reduce HCV binding, which remained stable and above the levels of virus binding after anti-CD81 treatment. Thus, IFITM1 does not function to block CD81-dependent binding of HCV to target cells (Fig. 4B) . Importantly, we found that HCV entry was blocked by ectopic IFITM1 expression to a level similar to the blockade imposed by treatment with anti-CD81 antibody (Fig. 4B) . These data indicate that, while HCV can bind to hepatocytes in the presence of IFITM1, the virus is unable to enter cells and complete the infection process. The reduction of HCV entry to levels corresponding to an anti-CD81 control suggests that CD81-dependent HCV entry is regulated by IFITM1.",

These immunoprecipitations were performed using equivalent amounts of protein lysates in CHAPS buffer, which has been demonstrated to preserve CD81 interactions with associated proteins. 28 We have experimentally determined that these conditions lead to consistent and specific immunoprecipitation reactions.

We found that IFITM1 associates with the tight junction marker ZO-1, but not the adherens junction marker E-cadherin 30, 31 (Fig. 5A ).

We found that IFITM1 expression was induced by IFN in chimeric mouse liver tissue (Supporting Fig. 2) . We also conducted confocal microscopy of chimeric liver sections costained for IFITM1 and ZO-1 or occludin (Fig. 6B ). Similar to IFN treatment of patient liver, IFITM1 colocalized with tight junctions in IFN-treated chimeric mouse liver, demonstrating a tight junction pattern of localization. Colocalization was confirmed by three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal images and Huh7-vector were infected with pseudoparticles containing envelopes of the indicated viruses. Viral entry was determined by luciferase activity in relative light units. (B, C) Huh7-IFITM1 or Huh7-vector, each with and without neutralizing anti-CD81, were bound with HCV (MOI \u00bc 1) at 4 C for 1 hour. Cells were either harvested for RNA to assess binding (B) or shifted to 37 C for 5 hours, followed by proteinase K cleavage of external virus and subsequent RNA collection to assess entry (C). HCV copy number was determined via qRT-PCR. The dotted line on the HCV entry panel refers to the limit of detection for this HCV qRT-PCR assay. *P < 0.05.

The failure of the current IFN-based therapy to achieve sustained viral inhibition in a significant portion of patients treated, coupled with the inability of many patients to tolerate the widespread side effects of IFN therapy, drives the need for more effective and targeted treatments.

We propose that the anti-HCV actions of IFITM1 are attributed to its ability to disrupt the coordination of coreceptor interactions. These actions impart control of HCV by disrupting the assembly of HCV coreceptor complexes to suppress the HCV entry process.

            "text": "The IFITM family has been shown to impose antiviral actions against a number of viruses, including influenza A virus, SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus and HIV. 14, 15, 34 While these studies also showed that each of these viruses are restricted by IFITM1 at early stages of infection, the viruses studied do not share major viral entry receptors with HCV, nor are they known to involve tight junctions in their entry processes. This raises the question as to how IFITM1 exerts its antiviral function against different viruses. Notably, tetraspanins including CD81 have been shown to regulate HIV-induced cell fusion, and CD81 was recently identified to be necessary for optimal entry by influenza A virus. [35] [36] [37] These reports thus identify a common thread of at least three viruses known to be inhibited by IFITM1 through a class of molecules known to include IFITM1-interacting partners. 28 Tetraspanins have been demonstrated to regulate fusion of a number of additional viruses, 38 so it is likely that other IFITM1-regulated viruses use tetraspanins to regulate viral entry. Our finding that IFITM1 inhibits HCV entry is in contrast to a recent publication that showed that IFITM1 was unable to inhibit cellular entry by HCV pseudoparticles, yet it reduced viral replication. 16 This discrepancy is likely due to lower sensitivity of the HCV pseudoparticle system, as demonstrated in Fig. 4 . We were also unable to recapitulate the authors 0 reported effect of IFITM1 on HCV replication. This can in part be explained by a recent siRNA screen in which IFITM1 siRNA enhances HCV replication in the context of IFN treatment, but IFITM1 overexpression alone had no significant effect. 10 We propose that IFITM1 might in part affect HCV replication, but that the primary effect occurs at the level of viral entry, as in the case of other viruses studied. Another interesting component of antiviral activity of IFITM1 would be that against other viruses known to use the tight junction during their entry processes, such as coxsackie virus. 39 Our data thus far are not sufficient to make informed hypotheses about these viruses. One could propose that IFITM1 alters complexes involved in tight junctions and may affect these other viruses, or that there may be no effect on other viruses if they do not require affected coreceptors such as CD81 or occludin.",

This has also been demonstrated for HIV, where the virus was able to bind host cells and enter endosomal compartments, but was not released into the cytoplasm in the presence of IFITM1. 15 Because CD81 is known to regulate host and viral membrane fusions, 38 its complex redistribution in the presence of IFITM1 may alter the CD81-mediated regulation of viral fusion and subsequent entry into host cells. The primary role of tetraspanins such as CD81 appears to be the organization of membrane complex formation, 38 an essential process in viral entry into host cells and a likely target of IFITM1-mediated viral disruption. The tight junction localization of IFITM1 provides new insights into the cellular functions of this molecule.
