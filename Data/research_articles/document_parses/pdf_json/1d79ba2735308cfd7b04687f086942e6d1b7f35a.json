We assessed the prevalence, clinical presentation and outcomes of dementia among subjects hospitalized for COVID19 infection. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: COVID wards in Acute Hospital in Brescia province, Northern Italy. Participants: We used data from 627 subjects admitted to Acute Medical wards with COVID 19 pneumonia. Measurements: Clinical records of each patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of dementia, modalities of onset of the COVID-19 infection, symptoms of presentation at the hospital and outcomes were recorded. Results: Dementia was diagnosed in 82 patients (13.1%). The mortality rate was 62.2% (51/82) among patients affected by dementia compared to 26.2% (143/545) in subjects without dementia (p<0.001, Chi-Squared test).

Among patients diagnosed with dementia the most frequent symptoms of onset were delirium, especially in the hypoactive form, and worsening of the functional status.

Some patients need to be treated at home, often with caregivers burdened by isolation due to lockdown measures and by limitation of home services. Other patients are cared in nursing homes, which often lack adequate and trained staffs and access to personal protective equipment. Hospital patient's management has been difficult due to the scarce collaboration offered by the patient and difficulties in communication, immobility, and limited availability of trained staff members (6) . There are also ethical concerns regarding hospitalization of patients with dementia due to resource constraints during the current pandemic (7). To our knowledge, the proportion of subjects with dementia among patients admitted to an acute hospital for COVID-19 has never been evaluated. The prevalence of demented patient found in the present study (13.1%) is lower than the previous estimates of the prevalence of dementia in hospital, which vary from 15% to 42% (7) . According to our data, the diagnosis of dementia, especially in the most advanced stages, represents an important risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in subjects with dementia is atypical, reducing early recognition of symptoms and hospitalization. We suggest that the onset of hypoactive delirium and worsening functional status in people with dementia may be considered a sign of possible COVID-19 infection during this epidemic. Early recognition of COVID-19 in demented people can help provide timely treatment and adequate isolation.
