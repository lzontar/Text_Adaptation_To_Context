In the analysis of the entire series of COVID-19 positive patients with multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders (N=127), similar to the general population, cardiovascular risk factors were significantly associated with adverse outcome. 3 Independent of COVID-19, typically, patients with multiple myeloma are at an increased risk of infections due to both disease and treatment associated immunosuppression. 17 Examples of these associations are the immunomodulatory and conventional chemotherapy drugs which cause myelosuppression, the targeted monoclonal antibodies such as anti-CD-38 associated with suppression of the humoral immune system. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] In the current series, we did not identify an association between hypogammaglobulinemia and adverse outcome; however, due to the lack of detailed biomarker data, we were unable to rule out associations involving other immunological mechanisms (such as T-cell suppression) that are important in the immune response towards viral and other infections. In multiple myeloma patients undergoing high-dose melphalan chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant, it is well-known that there are severe acute as well as sustained long-term immunosuppression including broad aspects of the immune system. 23, 24 In this study, 39 of the 100 multiple myeloma patients included had been treated with autologous stem cell transplant, 7 within the 12 months prior to contracting SARS-CoV-2.
