This could justify the further study of this rTMS technique in more severe inpatient cases, where suicidality is of concern and rapid response is at a premium. Overall, final outcomes post-taper compared favorably to another large trial [19] , as well as a landmark meta-analysis [37] , which may be explained by the high number of total sessions. Supporting this observation, a recent study that offered up to 21 weeks of rTMS reported remission rates of 72% [38] . Since there is a lack of data about 1 Hz arTMS alone without the subsequent tapering period, we are unable to determine the impact or the necessity of such an extension. It may well be possible that 1 Hz arTMS has a delayed effect, where participants would have kept on improving without the extension course, as suggested in other arTMS protocols [12] .

Of primary concern is the open-label design and the absence of a sham control arm. It is to be expected that the various estimates of effectiveness might be higher than what would be obtained in a randomized, sham-controlled trial, which would represent the next logical step. In addition, the naturalistic approach of the study does not allow estimates of efficacy, but only effectiveness. The design of the study, with multiple reassessments throughout, presented logistical challenges, mainly with patient adherence. Indeed, several participants did not adhere to the planned schedule, and were thus reassessed outside of the planned boundaries. Additionally, we did not qualitatively assess our open-room setting, as discussed previously. We also had 10 participants lost to follow-up at 1month, limiting interpretation of results at that timepoint. In future studies, this would need to be .

Furthermore, frequency of tapering course varied between individuals. Although we recommended daily sessions for participants (5 sessions/week), a minimum of 3 sessions/week was tolerated, given the fact that this approach has proven effective on its own [40] . Moreover, results did vary between the self-rated BDI-II and the clinician-rated HRSD-17. Indeed, remission and response rates were higher postacutely and lower post-tapering and at 1-month follow-up visits on the BDI-II compared to HRSD-17. Discrepancies between self-and clinician-rated scales are not unique to our studies and have often been reported in MDD [41] , showing the general limitation of mood scales, and the need for objective biomarkers in psychiatry [42] . As a further matter, the weaker central field in the parabolic coils used may have under-stimulated the DLPFC [20] ; this may be correctable in future by moving the central opening to an intermediate mark between F4, Fz and Cz. Due to their less widespread use in clinical settings, results with 1 Hz rTMS on parabolic coils may not generalize to more commonly used Fo8 coils. The 1 Hz protocol used, although highly tolerable for participants, may also have been less effective due to its limited amount of pulses per session. Given that increased number of pulses has been associated with increased response in 1 Hz rTMS in some studies [43] , it may be advantageous to increase the number of pulses within the same time frame (e.g., 600 pulses in 10 min). Finally, although we did not require participants to meet the usual requirement of TRD in our trial, the majority (>80%) of participants had failed at least one adequate trial. We also did not have a minimal cut-off regarding depression severity on the mood scales for study inclusion, but average baseline scores on the BDI-II was in the severe range. Average HRSD-17 score was also higher than in a recent large trial from our group [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 59, "end": 75, "text": "June 17, 2020. .", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 380, "end": 384, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 749, "end": 753, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 855, "end": 859, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 972, "end": 976, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1505, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2056, "end": 2060, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(which was not certified by peer review)"}, {"text": "Given its established efficacy in MDD and its lower side-effect profile compared to medication, efforts should be made to make rTMS more accessible to the general public.
