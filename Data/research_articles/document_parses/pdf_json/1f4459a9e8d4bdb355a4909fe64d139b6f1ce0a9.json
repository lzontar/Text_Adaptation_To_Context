Red blood cell, a so-called moving internal-organ, reversibly binds and releases O 2 under physiological conditions. From this point of view, red blood cell substitutes, or O 2 -Infusions, are very important. In order to promote this research, we have emphasized that the establishment of basic science for macromolecular complexes and molecular assemblies is essential. We have systematically studied the Metal Complexes (synthetic heme derivatives) embedded into a hydrophobic cluster, and clarified that the electronic processes of the active sites are controlled by the surrounding molecular environment. Therefore, the reaction activity and its rate constant are observed as cooperative phenomena with the would take considerable time to arrive at a social consensus for its use. We started to produce Hb-vesicles (HbV) using purified Hbs and molecular assembly technologies. In the late 1990's, a mass-production system for recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) was established and we then prepared albumin-heme hybrids (rHSA-heme) using its non-specific binding ability, which is now considered to be a promising synthetic material.",

Since the 1970s, various approaches were developed to overcome these problems [7, 8] . This includes intramolecular crosslinking, polymerization and polymer-conjugation. However, in some cases the significantly different structure in comparison with red blood cells resulted in side effects such as vasoconstriction [9] .",

The surface of the vesicles is modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to ensure homogeneous dispersion when circulated in the blood and a shelf life of two years. The idea of Hb encapsulation with a polymer membrane mimicking the structure of RBC originated from Dr. Chang at McGill University [7] . After that, the encapsulation of Hb within a phospholipid vesicle was studied by Dr. Djordjevici at the University of Illinois in the 1970s [11]. However, it was not so easy to make HbV with a regulated diameter and ade-quate O 2 transport capacity. We made a breakthrough in routinely producing HbV by using fundamental knowledge of macromolecular and supramolecular sciences. Some of the related technologies have already been published in academic journals [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Several liters of HbV are routinely prepared in a completely sterile condition. Hb is purified from outdated red blood cells, and concentrated to 40 g/dl. Virus removal is performed using a combination of pasteurization at 60\u00b0C and filtration with a virus removal filter. The Hb encapsulation with phospholipids bilayer membrane and size regulation was performed with an extrusion method. The vesicular surface is modified with PEG chains. The suspension of Hb-vesicles is dated at the final stage.",

In this chapter two important facts are described. One is isovolemic hemodilution with 90% blood exchange in a rat model. The other is resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock in a hamster model. To confirm the O 2 transporting ability of HbV, extreme hemodilution was performed with HbV suspended in human serum albumin (HSA) [21, 23] Mean arterial pressure and renal cortical oxygen tension were monitored arterial pressure and renal cortical O 2 tension, and finally all the rats died of anemia. On the other hand, hemodilution with HbV, suspended in HSA sustained both blood pressure and renal cortical O 2 tension, and all the rats survived. These results clearly demonstrate that HbV, has sufficient O 2 transporting capability.",

We used the hamster dorsal-skin fold preparation that allows observation of blood vessels from small arteries to capillaries. We evaluated the HbV suspension as a resuscitative fluid for hemorrhagic-shocked hamsters [26] .About 50% of the blood was withdrawn, and the blood pressure was maintained at around 40 mmHg for 1 h. The hamsters either received HbV suspended in HSA (HbV/HSA), HSA alone, or shed blood (Fig. 3) . Immediately after infusion, all the groups showed increases in mean arterial pressure, however, only the albumin infusion resulted in incomplete recovery. The HbV/HSA group showed the same recovery with the shed autologous blood infusion. During the shock period, all the groups showed significant hyperventilation that was evident from the significant increase in arterial O 2 partial. Simultaneously, 6 K. Kobayashi et al. base excess and pH decreased significantly. Immediately after resuscitation, all the groups tended to recover. However, only the HSA group showed sustained hyperventilation. Base excess for the HSA group remained at a significantly lower value one hour after resuscitation. Blood flow decreased significantly in arterioles to 11% of basal value during shock. The HbV/HSA and shed autologous blood groups immediately showed significant increases in blood flow rate after resuscitation, while the albumin group showed the lowest recovery.",

XLHb (7 nm in diameter) showed a significant increase in hypertension equal to 35 mmHg, and simultaneous vasoconstriction of the resistance artery equal to 75% of the baseline levels [30] (Fig. 4) . On the other hand, HbV at 250 nm, showed minimal change. The small acellular XLHb is homogeneously dispersed in the plasma, and it diffuses through the endothelium layer of the vascular wall and reaches the smooth muscle. Intra-moleculary cross-linked Hb traps nitric oxide (NO) as an endothelium-derived relaxation factor, and induces vasoconstriction, and hypertension. On the other hand, the large HbV stay in the lumen and do not induce vasoconstriction. Several mechanisms are proposed for Hb-induced vasoconstriction. These include NO-binding, excess O 2 supply, reduced shear stress, or the presence of Hb recognition site on the Safety and Efficacy of Hemoglobin-Vesicles and Albumin-Hemes Professor Suematsu at Keio University has revealed the effects of Hb-based O 2 carriers in hepatic microcirculation [29, 32] (Fig. 5) . On the vascular wall of the sinusoid in hepatic microcirculation, there are many pores, called fenestration, with a diameter of about 100 nm. The small Hb molecules with a diameter of only 7 nm extravasate through the fenestrated endothelium and reach the space of Disse. On the other hand, HbV particles, which are larger than the pores, do not extravasate. Heme of extravasated Hb is excessively metabolized by hemeoxygenase-2 in hepatocyte to produce CO and bilirubin. Even though CO acts as a vasorelaxation factor in the liver, the excess amount of Hb rapidly binds CO, resulting in the vasoconstriction and an increase in vascular resistance. On the other hand, HbV (250 nm in diameter) is large enough to remain in the sinusoid, and the vascular resistance is maintained.",

The upper limitation is below the capillary diameter to prevent capillary plugging, and for sterilization by membrane filters (Fig. 6) . On the other hand, smaller sizes exhibit a higher rate of vascular wall permeability with side effects such as hypertension and neurological disturbances. HbV exhibits a very low level of vascular wall permeability. Therefore, the HbV appears to be appropriate from the viewpoint of hemodynamics. We have clarified the influence of HbV on the RES, because the fate of HbV is RES trapping. Circulation persistence was measured by monitoring the concentration of radioisotope-labeled HbV in collaboration with Dr. W.T. Phillips at the University of Texas at San Antonio. The circulation half-life is dose dependent, and when the dose rate was 14 ml/kg, the circulation half-life was 24 h. The circulation time in the case of the human body can be estimated to be twice or three times longer; or about 2 or 3 days at the same dose rate. Gamma camera images of radioisotope-labeled HbV showed the time course of biodistribution. Just after infusion, HbV remains in the blood stream so that the heart and liver that contain a lot of blood showed strong intensity. However, after it is finished playing its role in O 2 transport, a total of 35% of HbV are finally distributed mainly in the liver, spleen and bone marrow.",

The liver of an anesthetized hamster was exposed and a fluorescence-labeled-HbV was infused intravenously. Due to the motion of respiration, the picture oscillates. However, a static frame can be obtained. The individual particles of HbV cannot be recognized. When the vesicles are accumulated in phagosomes of Kupffer cells, they can be recognized with a strong fluorescence. How is HbV metabolized in macrophages? The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the spleen 1 day after infusion of HbV clearly demonstrated the presence of HbV particles in macrophages, where HbV particles that appear as black dots are captured by the phagosomes [34] (Fig. 7) . Red blood cells and HbV contain a lot of ferric iron with a high electron density, so that they show Safety and Efficacy of Hemoglobin-Vesicles and Albumin-Hemes 9 strong contrast in TEM. However, after 7 days, the HbV structure cannot be observed. We confirmed no abnormalities in the tissues and no irreversible damage to the organs or complete metabolism within a week. A Polyclonal anti-human Hb antibody was used as the marker of Hb in the HbV. This antibody does not recognize rat Hb. The red-colored parts indicate the presence of Hb in HbV, and almost disappear after 7 days in both the spleen and liver. This shows that HbV can be metabolized quite promptly. One issue of the Hb-based O 2 carriers is that they have a significant influence on clinical laboratory tests. They remain in the plasma phase in hematocrit capillaries after centrifugation of blood samples, and interfere with the colorimetric and turbidimetric measurements. However, HbV can be simply removed from blood plasma either by ultracentrifugation or centrifugation in the presence of a high-molecular-weight dextran to enhance precipitation. We can obtain a very clear supernatant for accurate analyses [35] . This is one advantage of HbV in comparison with acellular Hb solutions. Accordingly we examined the influence on organ functions by serum clinical laboratory tests after the bolus infusion of HbV at a dose rate of 20 ml/kg. Albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), which reflect the liver function, moves their values within normal range. Concentrations of bilirubin and ferric ion are maintained at a low level. The concentration of lipids transiently changed. In particular, the cholesterols increased significantly. And phospholipids slightly increased, however, they returned to the original level after 7 days. These results indicate that the membrane components of HbV, once they reappear from RES, are metabolized on the physiological pathway.",

A large-scale plant, which can produce one million vials per year, has been already established. From the viewpoint of clinical application, O 2 -carrying albumin is quite exciting and may be of extreme medical importance. With this background, we have found that synthetic heme derivative is efficiently incorporated into recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA), creating a red-colored rHSA-heme hybrid. This rHSA-heme can reversibly bind and release O 2 molecules under physiological conditions in the same manner as Hb. In other words, our rHSA-heme hybrid is a synthetic O 2 -carrying hemoprotein, and we believe that its saline solution will become a new class of red blood cell substitute. We have already published these chemistry findings and technologies in international journals [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . Figure 8 summarizes the structure of the albumin-heme molecule. The Maximal binding numbers of heme to one albumin are eight, and the magnitude of the binding constants ranged from 10 6 to 10 4 (M -1 ). The isoelectric point of rHSA-heme was found to be 4.8, independent of the binding numbers of heme. This value is exactly the same as that of albumin itself. Furthermore, the viscosity and density did not change after the incorporation of heme molecules, and the obtained solution showed a long shelf life of almost two years at room temperature. The O 2 -binding sites of rHSA-heme are iron-porphyrin, therefore the color of the solution changed in a similar way to Hb. Upon addition of O 2 gas through this solution, the visible absorption pattern immediately changed to that of the O 2 -adduct complex. Moreover, after bub-bling carbon monoxide gas, albumin-heme formed a very stable carbonyl complex. Figure 9 shows the O 2 -binding equilibrium curve of rHSA-heme. The O 2binding affinity, of rHSA-heme is always constant, independent of the number of heme, and the O 2 -binding profile does not show cooperativity. However, the O 2 -transporting efficiency of albumin-heme between the lungs where PaO 2 is 110 Torr and muscle tissue where PtO 2 is 40 Torr increases to 20%, which is similar to 22% efficiency of red blood cells. The O 2 -binding property of albumin-heme can be controlled by changing the chemical structure of heme derivatives incorporated. More recently, we have found that a protoheme derivative is also incorporated into albumin and can bind and release O 2 as well [50] . ",

Contrary to the expectations, the observation of the intestinal microcirculation after the infusion of rHSA-heme into an anesthetized rat revealed that the diameters of the venules and arterioles were not deformed at all [51] . Indeed, only a small change in the mean arterial pressure was observed after the administration of the rHSA-heme solution (Fig. 10) . In contrast, the infusion of Hb elicited an acute increase in blood pressure. Why does albumin-heme not induce vasoconstriction or hypertension? The answer probably lies in the negatively charged molecular surface of albumin. One of the unique characteristics of serum albumin is its low permeability through the capillary pore, which is less than 1/100 that for Hb due to the electrostatic repulsion between the albumin surface and the glomerular basement membrane around the endothelial cells.",
