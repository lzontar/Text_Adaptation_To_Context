            "text": "The authors raise relevant and justifiable concerns regarding some common assumptions among global health practitioners. First, we agree that the oft-assumed 'expertise gradient' is problematic and maintains an ill-conceived notion of the foreign expert. This presumes that global health is practised by foreign experts in distant lands, flowing directionally from high-income experts to low-income recipients. 2 While we reject this notion, we acknowledge the importance of exchanging knowledge and sharing experiences. In fact, health problems are often shared, transcend geographical boundaries, and can be better addressed by working together across various cultural, social or political perspectives. Moreover, highlighting the assumption that those from outside have more valuable knowledge suggests that the authors have not adequately acknowledged the increasing trend to work in partnership with governments and local organisations, placing local and foreign expertise on at least the same level. 3 Thus, how global health is practised is, in our view, just as important as where it is practised. Second, working somewhere else may result in someone having less cultural proficiency or professional regulation-rendering them less accountable to their intended beneficiariesthan when working at home. While this is certainly a problem when it occurs abroad, it is important to note that accountability issues can also arise at home. Marginalised, vulnerable or at-risk populations, including those within high-income countries, are intervened BMJ Global Health on without the same ability to demand accountability of the person or organisation delivering the intervention. 4 Furthermore, emerging trends in global health rely increasingly on a country-level or regional-level expertise, rather than bringing advisors from further afield who may lack contextual understanding. We therefore contend that, once again, the how is just as important as the where in this context.",

Yet we should also consider how resource constraint is a direct result of historical events such as slavery, colonisation and the development of the neoliberal economic order, the resultant moral obligation of which should account for at least some of the justification of global health interventions. 5 Thus, global health practitioners should be sensitive to such histories and work towards redressing these structural ills, for example, through systems advocacy and strengthening.",

Colonialism remains the original sin of global health and we believe that asking ourselves, 'why practise somewhere else?' is worthwhile. Likewise, the examination of our underlying assumptions and normative concerns is imperative in order to move the study and practice of global health towards delivering health equitably for all, everywhere. That is to say, the focus of global health should revolve around concerns of equity, social determinants, power and holistic well-being. 6 Nevertheless, the authors suggest that the field is distinguished by the geographical relationship between practitioners and recipients, and we feel that this definition is too limiting and does not do justice to the otherwise strong arguments made in the paper.",

We should begin by using the concept of 'health' as the parameter that we apply anywhere we practise, whether within or outside of our own communities. We suggest that, following the formula in WHO Constitution, 11 healthy individuals should be able to maximally participate and thrive in their community and daily life, with minimal barriers.

The delivery of public health anywhere in the world should strive to design approaches that use the best health information to provide affordable, accessible, quality health and wellbeing services equitably to all people everywhere. This encompasses many of the normative considerations of public health: that of universal health coverage; planetary health; sustainable development; and accessible BMJ Global Health health information.

This debate offers a healthy opportunity to re-examine our own assumptions, and we believe that our definition better addresses these concerns. We understand that although the roots of allopathic health lie in the developing world, global health has historically moved from higher to lower income countries.
