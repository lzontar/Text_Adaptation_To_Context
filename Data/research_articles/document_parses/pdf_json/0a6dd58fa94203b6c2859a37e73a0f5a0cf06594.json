            "text": "Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), a negative strand RNA virus of the genus Paramyxoviridae, is the most important cause of serious lower respiratory tract illness in infants [Kim et al., 1973; Mufson et al., 1973] . Reinfections occur frequently throughout life and may be severe in certain adult populations, including the frail elderly, persons with cardiopulmonary disease, and the immunocompromised [Englund et al., 1988; Walsh et al., 1999] . Diagnosis of RSV infection by either culture or antigen detection in nasopharyngeal secretions is not dif\u00aecult in infants with primary infection since infectious virus is abundant in the upper respiratory tract. However, these tests are insensitive in adults and investigators have relied primarily on serology for diagnosis [Falsey et al., 1992 [Falsey et al., , 1996 Dowell et al., 1996] . In the elderly, virus can be isolated in less than half of illnesses even when specimens are processed under optimal conditions. Antigen detection is considerably less sensitive than culture, demonstrating a positive result in approximately 10% of cases [Falsey et al., 1996] . Low viral titers in secretions and pre-existing nasal antibody may reduce virus recovery in adults [Hall et al., 1976 [Hall et al., , 1978 Englund et al., 1996] . In addition, it is frequently not possible to collect nasal washes from frail elderly adults and samples of respiratory secretions are often limited to nasopharyngeal swabs.",

Therefore, we sought to develop a one-tube nested PCR by using primer pairs from the A2 strain F gene sequence. Optimal conditions for the outer and inner primer pairs were \u00aerst determined separately, and then the maximal potential sensitivity for a nested PCR was de\u00aened by using each of the primer pairs in a two-tube method. In anticipation of contamination associated with a two-tube method, outer and inner primer pairs were selected with signi-\u00aecantly different melting temperatures (T m ) so that the outer primer round of the PCR could proceed at an annealing temperature signi\u00aecantly greater than the T m of the inner primers. This method has been used successfully by others and utilizes the concept that the inner primers anneal poorly at the higher temperature of the \u00aerst round reaction and thus do not interfere with the initial outer primer reaction [Mathis et al., 1997] . The second round of the PCR is then run at a lower annealing temperature to produce the \u00aenal nested DNA product. The sensitivity of this``differential temperature'' single-tube nested PCR was then determined using the A2 virus stock. Finally, a``hanging droplet'' single-tube nested PCR utilizing a 42 C annealing temperature for both outer and inner primer reactions was developed. For this method, the outer and inner primers were physically separated during the \u00aerst round of the PCR reaction.",

This problem is compounded by the extreme lability of RSV even when placed in viral transport media and kept at low temperature [Walsh and Hall, 1989] .

This was similar to the sensitivity of the two-tube nested PCR. To avoid potential cross contamination that complicates two-tube nested methods, a singletube reaction exploiting differential primer annealing temperatures based upon markedly disparate T m was attempted. Despite variations in primer concentration and annealing temperatures, the PCR only detected $17 pfu of RSV. However, by suspending a droplet containing the inner primers in the cap of the reaction tube during the \u00aerst PCR round, we could detect 0.05\u00b1 0.17 pfu of virus and avoided competition between primers, which appeared to have inhibited the``differential temperature'' single-tube nested PCR. This method is very similar to a published technique in which the inner primers were separated from the initial reaction by placing them in a hanging gel matrix [Yourno, 1992] . Another method of physically separating the primers for the \u00aerst round of a nested PCR has been described by other investigators using wax, rather than oil, to cover the reaction mixture that contains the outer primers [Whelen et al., 1995] . At completion of the \u00aerst round of the PCR, the wax solidi\u00aeed when the reaction tube was cooled, thus sealing the \u00aerst reaction mixture. The tube was then opened and a large volume of reaction mixture containing the inner primers was added. Although successful, opening the tube increases the risk of contamination, a concern we avoided by using the``hanging droplet'' to separate the primers. Furthermore, this modi\u00aecation obviated the need for the time consuming and complex manipulation of assay parameters when devising a one-tube nested PCR based upon differential primer T m . This PCR may have been improved by using shorter primers. The primers were originally chosen to develop a differential temperature PCR and it is possible that false priming or primer interactions may have occurred due to excessive length and the relatively low T m used. The result may be the smear seen at the bottom of the gels.",
