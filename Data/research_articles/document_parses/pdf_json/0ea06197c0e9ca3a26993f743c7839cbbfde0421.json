To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to evaluate chest CT features in patients with malignancy and concomitant COVID-19 infection. In fact, the imaging findings can be challenging and have not yet been fully understood in this setting. In this manuscript, we go over imaging findings in chest CT of patients with COVID-19 and known cancer. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and exponentially increasing incidence throughout the world, in at-risk and vulnerable populations such as patients with known malignancies, infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be included in the differential considerations even with atypical image pictures.",

The study by Liang W et al.

Eighteen patients with a history of cancer were found among 1590 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was higher than the general population, probably indicating a higher risk of viral infection in this population. On the other hand, patients with concomitant COVID-19 and cancer were noted to have a higher risk of severe events.",
