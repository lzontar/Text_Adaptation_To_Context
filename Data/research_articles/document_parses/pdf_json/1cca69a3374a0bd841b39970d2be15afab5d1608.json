In this context, mental health initiatives focused on (i) educating public and health care workers on how to properly deal with the immense pressure and anxiety, (ii) providing targeted mental health surveillance followed by effective interventions for at-risk populations (e.g., patients with prior mental health diagnosis, the elderly, people in total home confinement), and (iii) proactively establishing mental health programs specifically designed to manage the pandemic's aftermath, have been recently suggested as urgent measures of preventive and early intervention (WHO, 2020b; Galea et al. 2020 , Usher et al. 2020 ). 3, 13, 14 The psychosocial needs of at-risk individuals, including those in quarantine and/or home confinement, are suggested to be unique. 14 Preventive, early and rehabilitation-focused interventions to promote mental wellbeing should be designed to be \"crisisoriented\" and should be informed by outcomes from scientific research, as opposed to hypothetical and speculative suggestions.
