However, the daily reporting of COVID-19 deaths is already known to undercount actual deaths, varying over time and place. [4] [5] [6] Reliable estimates of total COVID-19 mortality, the date of peak deaths, and of the duration of excess mortality are crucial to aid responses to the current and potential future pandemics. We have developed the Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model to project COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1 2020 in 12 countries or regions that constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12 th . We report also on six US states that account for 70% of the American totals to date (Supplementary Appendix). 1 We quantify the COVID-19 mortality trajectory ranges in each setting. A semi-automated website (www.cghr.org/covid) provides daily updates. GCAM is open, transparent, and uses a reasonably simple method that employs publicly reported mortality data to make plausible projections. The method is designed to improve as more mortality data become available over longer time periods.",

Such information should aid planning and help avert an overwhelming of health systems.",

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model considers physical distancing through May 2020 and has median death estimates lower than ours (Supplementary Appendix). However, the IHME model has some implausible results like suggesting that Netherlands will have 16,000 deaths which is only slightly below their estimate for France and Spain, despite being at least three times larger in population. 22 Moreover, the IHME analyses assumes a symmetrical bell-shaped mortality curve, whereas a skewed curve (which we use) is observed in the actual data. 1-3 Our totals for the USA fall broadly within the range projected by the White House Task Force of 100,000 to 240,000 deaths, 24 and our Canadian estimates are consistent with infectious disease dynamic model results. 25 There is little doubt that some of GCAM forecasts are wrong as undercounts of COVID-19 and delayed reporting are common. [4] [5] [6] For example, the undercount in UK COVID-19 deaths might have been about 70% for some weeks. 4 For France, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK, we could find some record of undercounts and correcting for these substantially raised the total deaths in each country (Supplementary Appendix). However, systematic examination of undercounts across settings is needed to establish if the undercounts have accelerated during the epidemic, which would mean that we have underestimated the speed of the upward trajectory, or if they are more random, in which case our results would mostly be unaffected. Future iterations of GCAM will incorporate undercounts in as many countries as document these. Differences in .

Third, in settings with few deaths over many days, the model becomes highly sensitive to the assumed prior distributions. However, the model validation (Supplementary Appendix) showed reasonably good performance with actual death counts in several countries. As with all models, ours emphasizes the need to obtain additional days of observation and rerun the analyses as data improve, and as additional epidemiological research results become available. 26 The GCAM is set up to be do so, hence its results improve constantly.",

The model builds on observed daily mortality counts for places that have already reached the peak of their epidemic (such as Hubei, China), or are near their peak (e.g. Italy and Spain), where the posterior probabilities are less relevant. For the majority of settings where the epidemic is still accelerating, death counts are currently less predictive, since a variety of curves can fit any particular series of increasing counts. In these cases, GCAM relies on Bayesian prior distributions, which are quantifications of expert knowledge of the underlying process expressed as probability distributions for model parameters. Bayesian prior distributions allow use of past epidemiological knowledge from China where COVID-19 has already declined, as well as the mortality trajectories of diseases caused by similar coronaviruses causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 8 or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). 9",
