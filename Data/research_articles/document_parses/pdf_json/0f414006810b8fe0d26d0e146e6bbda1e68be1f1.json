The objective of this talk is to describe the principles of 4D CT acquisition, ongoing developments to improve 4D CT image quality, and applications and limitations of 4D CT. Methods: 4D CT images are created by acquiring oversampled CT data simultaneously with a respiratory signal and reconstructing a number of 3D CT datasets. These 3D CT datasets are then correlated with a given respiratory displacement range or phase range to include respiratory motion into the images. First published on and commercially available in 2003, 4D CT is now a widely used imaging modality for radiotherapy. More recently, 4D cone-beam CT has also been demonstrated to be a useful tool to assist target localization prior to radiation delivery.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Since the inception of 4D CT, developments to improve image quality, predominantly to reduce artifacts due to respiratory irregularity, have been ongoing. Artifacts occur at an alarming rate in 4D CT, e.g. artifacts >4mm have been measured in over 90% (46/50) of retrospectively phase sorted patient 4D CT scans in our clinic. Efforts to reduce artifacts and improve image quality can be broadly classified into three groups: (1) improving the respiratory regularity of the patient through coaching, e.g. by using audiovisual biofeedback, (2) improving the data acquisition by selectively acquiring data during regular respiration only, and (3) improving post-processing methods. 4D CT produces an order of magnitude more data than 3D CT, thus creating an increase in image segmentation, planning, and storage. Some of the anatomic segmentation tasks can be automated through deformable image registration. Efforts in planning on 4D datasets are ongoing. An exciting application of 4D CT is for ventilation assessment, which potentially can yield ventilation images more quickly, cost effective, and with higher resolution than nuclear medicine studies. Validation of 4D CT for ventilation is therefore needed. Conclusions: 4D CT is useful for several modes of radiation delivery, including motion inclusive delivery, respiratory gated delivery, and tumor tracking delivery. 4D CT also serves as a tool to quantify tumor motion to determine if respiratory management is necessary during treatment delivery and also the appropriate management strategy. An important and often overlooked feature of 4D CT, is that it is only a snapshot of the anatomy at a specific time, but by using it for treatment planning, it is intended to be representative of the anatomy for days or weeks of treatment. Therefore, as respiratory motion changes from cycle-to-cycle, and changes in functional reserve capacity and patient pose cause daily variations in treatment position, systematic errors in target position estimation can occur with 4D delivery methods. This can be true even if a 4D CT is acquired immediately prior to treatment delivery. Accurate management of respiratory motion and novel delivery and image acquisition methods for 4D CT may however reduce these errors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Introduction: Cone beam CT (CBCT) data gives information at the time of treatment on both anatomical detail and electron density of the tissue, using the Hounsfield Unit (HU) value. This allows comparison of the dose delivered with the planned dose from the conventional CT (convCT) scan. To date there have been very few studies on the accuracy of CBCT data for dose calculation. Yang[1], Ding[2] and van Zijtfeld [3] report good agreement for convCT and CBCT dose calculations on small patient samples, but there has not been direct comparison of measured and CBCT calculated doses. However, measured doses remain the \"gold standard\". Van Esch, assessing Eclipse AAA algorithm, reports point dose measurements in thorax phantom within 5% of calculated [4]. This work investigates the accuracy of the kilovoltage CBCT data for dose calculation, by comparison with measured values, as a part of a larger study on adaptive radiotherapy using CBCT. Methods: Kilovoltage CBCT images were obtained using the On-Board imager (OBI) integrated in Varian iX linac, for full fan and half fan modes, corresponding to small and large fields of view. Calibration of the HU was performed following manufacturer's recommendations. GE Lightspeed scanner was used for the convCT scans. Dose measurements were made on a simple block phantom, made up of water-equivalent, lung and bone slabs, using 0.6cm3 chamber, at both 6MV and 18MV. Doses were calculated for the three CT configurations, using Eclipse AAA algorithm. Results: CT scans were assessed using a central profile, as shown in figure 1 for the large field of view CBCT.

With less than 5 minutes scan and reconstruction time, a series of MV-CT images can be created. In this study, MV-CBCT image quality has analysed with comparing different scanning protocols with giving different gantry rotation angles and monitor units to the scanning processes. Based on good image quality and reliable result of electron density calibration, the MV CBCT images tested for direct planning process on CMS XiO 3D planning system. The planning result compared with normal planning process carried by kV-CT images especially for same patients with high density artificial tissues involved around the treatment region. Methods: Electron density calibration phantom is used for MV-CBCT scans given 4~8 MUs for 200 degree gantry rotation scan and 8~15MUs for 360 degree gantry rotation scans. The CT HU numbers are read from CMS XiO after the images transferred into the planning system, and 3D planning cases selected patients with artificial tissues such as artificial teeth for head/neck or hip prosthesis for prostates. The dose delivered by the planning results was tested with by ionization measurement using IMRT phantom. Results: Electron density calibration shows well reliability and reproducibility on MV-CBCT tissue equivalent to electron density responded by planning images. The calibrated electron density curves indicated with more linear shape compared with kV-CT electron density curves. The result for low MU scans indicated with higher reading noises however, there no noticeable curve shape changes. Compare the electron density calibration for different scan doses, the calibration curves were shown no significant differences. The planning calculated effective depth for imhomogeneity tissues on each beam in 3D was satisfied accurate. Compare same planning cases performed by using normal kV-CT images, for the cases involved with high density artificial tissues in the treatment region, the accuracy shows the advantages using MV-CBCT image. This result has approved by reviewing the point dose ionization measurement via IMRT phantom. Discussion: Obviously, improved image reconstruction technique and software smoothing process provides more uniformity and reliability to the reconstructed MV-CBCT images. This improvement is potentially providing the chance for MV-CBCT image can be used for direct 3D treatment planning processes. The testing result also shows that the current version of CMS 3D planning system is capable to handle the independent 3D planning calculation with using MV-CBCT images. The planning calculation results were less perturbed by high density artificial tissues on GTV contouring, and reduced the uncertainty level on tissue density calculation.

Introduction: The topic deals with phenomena like arrhythmia (bradycardia, tachycardia) and sudden cardiac death, especially with atrial flutter. The reasons of these phenomena will be suppose in ionic-and electrochemical processes of cell metabolism, the synchronisation between neighbouring cells, as well as the electromechanical coupling to neighbouring cells. Methods: By means of the relation between intra-and extracellular concentration of ions will be generated a time-dependent membrane potential.

Furthermore the reasons for the occurence of \"atypical\" auto oscillators in the working myocardium are supposed to be a consequence of the fluctuations of ionic-concentration c k . Every cell of heart will be excited periodically phase shifted to her neighbours by \"All or Nothing Law\" and return again into her resting state under the influence of electrogenic pumps. We can summarize a nonlinear differential equation system of order 3: Introduction: Over the years, the role of the right ventricle (RV) of the heart in maintaining normal overall haemodynamics and interventricular dependence has become much more recognized. Measurements of the shape and the regional deformation of not only the left ventricle (LV), but also the RV, are essential for quantifying normal and impaired cardiac function. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered to be the most accurate method for assessing the size and function of the RV due to its excellent image quality and reproducibility, especially in right ventricular dysplasia. Cardiac Image Modeller (CIM), a software package developed by the Auckland MRI Research Group (AMRG), enables rapid visualization and analysis of MR images in 3D space and through time. Through interactive fitting of a deformable model of the LV to MR images, mass, volume and ejection fraction of the LV at end-diastole and end-systole can be obtained (see Fig. 1 (a) & (b)). It is the aim of this study to extend the CIM interactive modelling techniques developed by AMRG to fast and efficient clinical analysis of both LV and RV deformation.

The dose calculation accounts for the EPID energy response and possesses a detailed two-source model for fluence prediction. This model demonstrates the accuracy needed for IMRT portal dose image prediction in complex clinical examples (< 3%, 3 mm) and can be used for pre-treatment verification. The fluence model incorporated several significant improvements compared to a TPS fluence model. The fluence model improvements described here could potentially be incorporated into patient specific dose calculation algorithms. Future work will implement this model with a previously developed algorithm that predicts patient scatter energy fluence in the EPID. Introduction: Backscattered radiation from the support arm structures of the Varian amorphous silicon EPID (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) has been found to affect dose by up to 5% for large field sizes, particularly at the superior end of the detector where the support arm components lie. The backscattered component (BSC) is largest in fields that irradiate the maximum amount of the support arm eg the flood-field (FF). The FF calibration image therefore only compensates for BSC for an acquired image of the same field size. For smaller fields the BSC in the FF correction image will be larger than in the acquired image introducing dosimetric artifacts. In this work we characterize the BSC with field size, and investigate whether removing the BSC of the FF will improve the accuracy of EPID dosimetry for smaller fields. Methods: Square field images of fields of size 2.5, to 27.5 cm 2 in 2.5 cm 2 increments as well as a 40x30 cm 2 full detector image were acquired with the EPID centred on the support arm as normally employed. The irradiations were made using flood-field acquisition mode where only dark-field corrections are applied by the software for both 6 and 18 MV photons. The EPID was then removed from the support arm (E-Arm & R-Arm types) and the irradiations repeated. The ratio of the images was calculated to yield the BSC for each field size. Results: Figure 1 (a) shows the BSC for the FF (40x30 cm 2 ) irradiation (E-Arm type). The maximal backscatter occurs directly above the central support arm section with an increase of 6% in signal. This introduces a large gradient in the inplane direction to the FF and a smaller artifact in the crossplane direction which are then applied to all FF-corrected acquired images. Figure 2shows the influence of backscatter from the support arm to the central axis. If the FF is not applied, a gradual increase in the BSC with field size is observed. However, if the images are corrected with the normal FF, the opposite effect can be seen. (circular marker) FF correction Discussion: The FF correction image introduces signal and gradient artifacts due to backscatter from the support arm. When the EPID is used in standard configuration, the increased signal from the FF adversely affects smaller images. Figure 2 shows that for EPIDs which use the E-arm type support structure, it is more accurate not to use the FF calibration for square field sizes less than 10 cm whereas larger field sizes benefit from incorporating the FF. This increases to a square field size of approximately 18 cm for the R-arm type support structure. Conclusions: Removing the BSC of the FF image will improve the accuracy of EPID dosimetry for some clinically relevant field sizes. This provides a simple solution to improve the accuracy of EPID dosimetry with the Varian device and will improve the accuracy of IMRT verification.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2155, "end": 2163, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2524, "end": 2537, "text": "Figure 2shows", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3050, "end": 3058, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "M.

This provides scope to use them as 'in-built' quality assurance devices which by their very nature are readily available, real-time and in a well defined geometric relation to the linac beam. This has particularly been of interest, as film processors are phased out of hospitals in favour of digital imaging equipment. Owing to this, we investigated the viability of a-Si EPIDs as a physics tool for routine QA in determining junction dose of X-ray fields at different gantry angles, something which would be difficult to do using other dosimetric techniques, collimator angle and source-to-detector distance (SDD). Methods: Measurements were performed using a-Si500 EPID mounted on a 2100C/D and a 21iX linac (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) with nominal photon energy of 6MV. Measurements were performed at different collimator and gantry angles and varying SDDs. No additional build-up material was used. High quality acquisition mode (10 frames for 6MV) was selected. The nominal dose rate was 600MU/min. Asymmetric jaw settings were used with one jaw set to 0 and the other to 10cm. The other pair of jaws was set symmetrically to 20cm opening.

However, EPIDs can also be used to check collimator misalignment as well as junction dose at any gantry angle of practical importance, which is difficult with films. Our investigation shows jaw misalignment of even 0.1 degree can be detected. Further more, the effect of gantry sag has been observed at gantry angles 90 and 270 degree where the junction dose was found to be consistently higher. This is because the jaw closer to the floor sags more than the other jaw and as a result the opening between jaws increases to give higher junction dose. Finally, the study shows that reproducibility of jaw position can easily be accessed. Conclusions: The use of EPID for verification of X-ray junction dose at various gantry angles and jaw misalignment proved to be flexible and effective. A large number of single images can be acquired quickly and as a result, a large number of parameters can be determined by combining appropriate images. Future studies will extend the work to spoke shots and the assessment of multileaf collimator settings. quite often not until after it has finished. In addition, any discovered error in the target position using this method can be attributed with equal validity to either an actual setup error or simply to movement of the film between exposures. Following the installation of a Siemens Oncor Impression linear accelerator fitted with an electronic portal-imaging device (EPID), a new method for determining the location of the target in BRW space has been developed. This involves acquiring pretreatment AP and lateral double-exposed electronic portal images and using them with a custom-developed software application to calculate the target position. Methods: Testing of the software application was performed by inputting coordinates from pre-acquired portal films that had been previously analysed using the SCS1 and comparing the resulting target coordinates. To test system accuracy, portal images using both film and EPID were acquired for multiple target positions using the BRW reference frame and a custom phantom and analysed using the SCS1 or software application.

The shortening of the time required to complete the QA using the new method allows a transition from a post-to a pre-treatment check and also eliminates ambiguity in the potential source of error of the target position.

In addition to providing support for the diagnosis of many diseases, specific imaging modalities can be utilized for surgical training, planning, and Virtual Reality for guiding interventions. In general, multiple imaging modalities can be combined in an augmented display, through superimposed volumetric displays, multiple screens, interactive exploration, and haptic feedback. We have been developing specific systems for the display of pre-operative CT and MRI along with intra-operative Ultrasound integrated with surgical tool tracking using magnetic position sensors. Methods: In the design of Human-Computer Interfaces, it is important to consider the capacities and limitations of both the computer system and the human operator. Our research interests span the domains of Software Engineering and Experimental Psychology. Results from both areas are needed in order to develop immersive 'virtual' environments. We regard the design of HCI systems as an enterprise activity --it is a user-centred process which is built on multiple iterations of a design-implement-test-refine loop. This design cycle includes evaluative research ('human factors'), and needs to be informed by basic scientific research in Perception, Cognition, and Motor Control. In order to unify these approaches for applications in HCI, we must considering formal methods for linking Science and Engineering disciplines. Carroll and Rosson (1996) have articulated a method for conducting parallel activities in Software Engineering and Cognitive Science. They have proposed a method for representing the formal artifacts of a design process using Object-Oriented Software analysis methods, along with descriptions which capture, in their words, \"causal schemas\" --the former are descriptions of how software objects interact to form working systems, and the latter are claims about the user-centred phenomena associated with these design artifacts (in the user interface), which have certain properties that can be linked with specific psychological and perceptual phenomena. Carroll and Rosson describe the resulting process as an 'action science,' but we think of it as nothing more than a prescription for how to drive research along on both fronts, in a way which facilitates linkages between the two. We have embraced this innovative approach as a candidate method for designing applications involving tele-robotic systems, for biomedical visualization, and for surgical training. Results: When several imaging modalities are combined from disparate displays onto one screen using Augmented Reality presentation, the resulting scene dynamics and translucency effects open up a number of empirical questions. Recent theories of perceptual integration (more specifically, the formation of subjective contours in stereoscopic presentation, with structurefrom-motion, texture gradients, and occlusion boundaries) inform us that the design of our displays need careful consideration of the capacities and constraints of the human visual and cognitive faculties. Furthermore, in order to assess the usability of these enhanced systems objectively, we must make use of methodologies from human-computer interface design, perceptual testing, and visual-motor paradigms from experimental psychology. Discussion: Our current User-Interface and Psychology research project involves examining individual differences in strategy choice on spatial tasks, their aptitude for spatial reasoning, and how these differences can best be supported when designing computer interfaces for surgical training. We are developing user interface software according to the principle that users may prefer different interaction modes and viewpoints depending on which subtask is performed within an overarching surgical procedure. We are using workflow analysis to rank these subtasks and categorize according to factors of Diagnosis, Planning, Wayfinding, Navigation, Manipulation, and Retrieval. These implicate different usage, and different display modalities, when performing a task using a 'virtualized' interface. We are investigating specific individual differences in spatial reasoning and using the results to design user interfaces which are adaptable to the individual.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1591, "end": 1616, "text": "Carroll and Rosson (1996)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Robarts Research Institute, UWO, Canada 2 Department of Electrical Engineering, UWO, Canada 3 Canadian Surgical Technologies and Advanced Robotics (CSTAR) LHSC, Canada"}, {"text": "Introduction: Movements in people with Parkinson's disease are often hypometric, although we shown that this was not the case in an experimental visually-guided reaching task. However, these movements may also be intrinsically hypometric but visual feedback may be used to get accurately to the target in a single, albeit complex, movement. This hypometria may be more pronounced in memory-guided movements that involve the basal ganglia to a greater degree. Decomposing movements into individual components should reveal the strategy that is used. A fast movement to a fixed target can be thought of as being composed of one or more submovements, each of which is preprogrammed and generated by an inverse internal model. The first of these is called the initial, or primary, submovement. We wished to explore our hypotheses that (1) people with Parkinson's disease produce hypometric primary submovements but (2) are able to use visual feedback to accurately reach the target in a single overall movement and (3) this effect may be greater in memory-guided tasks in which an internal representation of the target location is used instead of a fixation-centered representation of the target. Methods: A Movement and Virtual Environment (MoVE) system, comprising a calibrated, low-latency, near-field 3D virtual environment with an electromagnetic tracker, was used to run the experiment and record the data. Visually-and memoryguided reaching movements were examined in 22 people with mild to moderate severity Parkinson's disease on medication, along with age-matched and sex-matched controls. Primary submovements were extracted from 5149 movements using a method based upon zero crossings of jerk (3rd derivative of position), with several additional criteria to minimize the detection of submovements due to noise or tremor. The gains of the primary and final movements were then calculated. A linear mixed-effects model was used for the multiple dependent variables, with fixed effects of Group and Task, and a random effect of subject. Discussion: The final gain in both tasks was not different between groups, although there was a task effect. On the memoryguided task, overall gains were smaller, related to spatial memory underestimating the distance to the target. In comparison to the final gain, the gain of the primary submovement was found to be substantially smaller in the Parkinson's disease group compared to controls in both tasks. Also, while the gain of the primary submovement was equal in both tasks for the control group (even though the final gain of the memory-guided movement was smaller), the gain was smaller in the memory-guided task compared to the visually-guided task in the Parkinson's disease group (even though the final gain in the memory-guided task was not different to that of controls). This highlights the extra difficulty people with Parkinson's disease have in making a movement of the correct size, especially when the target is represented in spatial memory or is internally generated. In older people and in pathological conditions there are several other contenders for submovements beside a primary submovement and corrective submovement. Firstly, if the multiple limb segments are not coordinated perfectly this can lead to irregularities in the movement traces which are not directly attributable to a separately generated submovement. Additionally, multiple forms of tremor (e.g., rest, action, and essential) all add irregularities to the movement trace and are a form of overlaid unintentional submovements. However, use of criteria that a detection has to be significant in comparison to jitter at rest, which in many cases causes the algorithm to treat the peak velocity of the movement as the peak velocity of the submovement, means that in many cases the algorithm is likely over-estimating the size of the primary submovement in subjects with tremor. Conclusions: Our results show that the underlying primary submovement in visually-guided movements in people with Parkinson's disease is hypometric and that the degree of hypometria is even greater in memory-guided movements. More sophisticated submovement decomposition methods, in combination with additional sensors attached to all upper-limb segments in the analysis, may be able to tease out the contributions of the different joints and the components of the movement that are due to a form of tremor. This will offer greater insight into how the production and size of submovements change in people with Parkinson's disease and may also offer an objective measure to quantify motor improvements due to treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 911, "end": 914, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Robarts Research Institute, UWO, Canada 2 Department of Electrical Engineering, UWO, Canada 3 Canadian Surgical Technologies and Advanced Robotics (CSTAR) LHSC, Canada"}, {"text": "Augmented Reality (AR) allows medical data to be overlaid on the real world, providing new methods for medical visualization.

Introduction: Hyperglycaemia is prevalent in critical care due to the stress of condition, even without a previous history of diabetes. Tight glycaemic control is associated with significantly improved patient outcomes. However, providing tight control is difficult due to evolving patient condition and interactions with common drug therapies resulting in recurring hyperglycaemic episodes. Model-based and model-derived tight control methods, such as the SPRINT system in Christchurch, have shown significant reductions in mortality. However, as computational capability and access improve, there are still avenues of further improvement to be made -if better models and/or methods were available. This research presents an updated control model, and its predictive virtual patient validation for use in real-time glycaemic control.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HIT Lab NZ, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"}, {"text": "The model is based on prior work in this area by the authors' research group and defines a simple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic system model: In the model, G is the blood glucose level, I is the plasma insulin, and Q is the interstitial insulin. EGP max is the theoretical maximum endogenous glucose production for a patient under no presence of glucose or insulin. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) is suppressed with increasing G and Q. Insulin independent glucose removal (excluding central nervous system uptake CNS) and the suppression of EGP from EGP max with respect to G are represented with p G . In contrast, insulin Introduction: Insulin resistance (IR), or low insulin sensitivity, is a major risk factor in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Current tests are either very labour intensive (Euglycaemic clamp, IVGTT) or have too low resolution (HOME, fasting glucose/insulin). A simple, high resolution assessment of IR would enable earlier diagnosis and more accurate monitoring of intervention effects. This research is based on a previously validated model-based method for measuring insulin sensitivity (S I ) which is highly correlated to the gold-standard clamp. The prior work utilises both insulin and glucose measurements approximately every 5 minutes as well as Cpeptide measurements. The protocol is of short duration (<1 h), is a simple protocol, has low cost and high repeatability. This paper improves the accuracy of model-parameter identification for the insulin kinetics with little to no added computational cost. It also significantly reduces the number of insulin measurements required to identify S I , and shows that the removal of Cpeptide measurements has little effect on the accuracy of S I . Methods: Clinical data is used from a prior study which included 46 insulin sensitivity short IGVTT tests and with ethics approval granted by the Upper South A Regional Ethics committee. A full data set of glucose, insulin and Cpeptide measurements is first assumed, and a new extended iterative integral-based parameter identification is implemented to identify insulin kinetics. Once the insulin kinetics are obtained, insulin sensitivity is obtained using a previously derived one iteration integral method. The new iterative integral method uses an approximate analytical solution to the non-linear saturated kinetic equations and requires very minimal computation. This method, first assumes there is no saturation to obtain an approximate insulin curve. This approximate insulin curve is then substituted into the saturated part of the insulin kinetics differential equations, to enable an approximate solution to the full saturation equations. For the insulin kinetics analysis, the accuracy of the method is compared to the previous one iteration integral method. An analysis is then done, to find the minimal data set required for accurate insulin sensitivity measurement. This analysis includes removing Cpeptide measurements, followed by insulin measurements. All glucose measurements are kept. The baseline for comparison is the S I value from the full data set. Results: The new iterative integral method is found to converge very rapidly with very little more computational time required. The percentage model insulin response errors are typically 3-5% compared to 7-15% for the one iteration integral method. A similar iterative integral method applied to the glucose response was not used as simulation showed it only gave a small reduction in error (<2%). The removal of Cpeptide measurements had only a very small effect on S I (<1%). The use of one basal insulin measurement I basal , one insulin measurement 10-15 minutes after the bolus I bolus , and a near steady state Introduction: Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels) occurs in 40-80% of very low birth weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This condition has been linked to mortality and morbidities including retinopathy of prematurity, osmotic diuresis, reduced immune system performance and sepsis. Insulin therapy can control hyperglycaemia and promote growth, but increases the risk of dangerous low levels of blood glucose. The goal of this model is to provide a vehicle for real-time blood glucose control by accurately capturing the dynamic effect of insulin to provide dosing recommendations for attending clinicians. The model is used for two tasks: predict future blood glucose concentration for real-time control, and perform simulated trials to optimise control strategies. Methods: The glucose regulatory system model is based upon a similar model employed successfully in adult intensive care, and modified to account for differing physiology in the neonate. Insulin sensitivity is the driving parameter in the model. Stochastic modelling and time-series analysis methods provide confidence bands for blood glucose predictions. Retrospective data is used to generate patient-specific, time-varying insulin sensitivity profiles via integral-based parameter identification methods. The profiles are used to generate \"virtual patients\", which are used to simulate patient responses to glucose and insulin inputs. Results: Retrospective data for 25 episodes of insulin usage representing over 3,500 hours of patient data was used to validate the model in simulation. Median absolute prediction errors for the 25 virtual patients at 1 and 2 hour intervals were 5.8% and 9.9% respectively. Stochastic modelling of the insulin sensitivity parameter averaged 59% of blood glucose predictions within the 0.98 mmol/L wide 25%-75% confidence range, and 91% of measurements within the 2.79 mmol/L wide 5%-95% confidence range. Simulations using basic controllers over the 25 \"virtual patients\" resulted in 87% of hourly simulated measurements within the target 4-7 mmol/L band, compared to 31% for retrospective hospital control. Mean blood glucose decreased 32% from 8.4 mmol/L to 5.7 mmol/L, and the standard deviation decreased 44% from 3.2 mmol/L to 1.8 mmol/L. Increased time in a target band and reduced standard deviation are robust measures of the tight control possible with model-based methods. Incorporating the stochastic model into simulated controllers resulted in a 17% decrease in simulated measurements below 4 mmol/L. Discussion: Insulin sensitivity in the neonate was found to be higher than similar adult model due to higher metabolic clearance of insulin clearance and higher rates of glucose turnover. Endogenous glucose production may not be suppressed by exogenous glucose infusions in the neonate, exacerbating hyperglycaemia. Additionally, limited glycogen stores and low concentrations of enzymes for gluconeogenesis mark the importance of optimising glucose uptake. Blood glucose control presents several challenges that are unique to this group of infants. Limited blood volume places restrictions on the frequency of blood glucose sampling achievable in practice. Virtual simulations allow testing of measurement frequency regimes in-silico and optimization during real-time control.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "Incorporating stochastic models provides extra assurance against hypoglycaemia.

It involves active follow up of the performance of the product in the market, and using the information gleaned from that activity in a process of continuous improvement.

Traditionally, the position of the patient during planning is replicated for treatment through the use of room lasers and portal imaging. Recently, cone-beam CT integrated linacs have become commonplace for IMRT. A significant shortcoming involved with these methods is that they do not take setup deformations to the patient into account. Methods: This system allows the radiation therapist to visually guide the patient during positioning for treatment using augmented reality (AR). The program utilises AR by superimposing a 3D surface contour of the patient (obtained from the planning CT) over a real-time image during treatment to assist the RT with position guidance. The scale and position of the 3D contour are chosen to precisely replicate the planning position. Not only does this provide setup verification without additional ionizing radiation exposure to the patient, but it also offers constant patient monitoring throughout the whole treatment process. Results: In trials of the AR system with a 30 cm wooden phantom, deformations to its position have been easily apparent (figure 1) and corrections can be administered with accuracy on the order of millimetres. Although the system has yet to be tested in a clinical environment, it is expected that it will operate with similar accuracy. Discussion: A focus on simplicity has been prominent in the development of this system. The user interface has intentionally been made straightforward, requiring little user input. It is also easy and inexpensive to set up, and will take up little space in a linac room. Simplicity has been emphasised because the system is not intended as an alternative to current methods of position guidance, but as a supplement that the radiation therapist can refer to for verification.

When converting patient CT data into a voxelised format suitable for MC simulations, however, it is common to simplify the assignment of electron densities so that the complex tissues existing in the human body are categorized into a few basic types. This study examines the effects that the assignment of tissue types and the calculation of densities can have on the results of MC simulations, for the particular case of a Siemen's Sensation 4 CT scanner located in a radiotherapy centre where QA measurements are routinely made using 11 tissue types (plus air). Methods: DOSXYZnrc phantoms are generated from CT data, using the CTCREATE user code, with the relationship between Hounsfield units (HU) and density determined via linear interpolation between a series of specified points on the 'CT-density ramp' (see Figure 1 (a)). Tissue types are assigned according to HU ranges. Each voxel in the DOSXYZnrc phantom therefore has an electron density (electrons/cm 3 ) defined by the product of the mass density (from the HU conversion) and the intrinsic electron density (electrons /gram) (from the material assignment), in that voxel. In this study, we consider the problems of density conversion and material identification separately: the CT-density ramp is simplified by decreasing the number of points which define it from 12 down to 8, 3 and 2; and the material-type-assignment is varied by defining the materials which comprise our test phantom (a Supertech head) as two tissues and bone, two plastics and bone, water only and (as an extreme case) lead only.

For instance, defining the CT-density ramp using 8 points, instead of 12, results in a maximum radiological thickness change of 0.2 cm, whereas defining the CT-density ramp using only 2 points results in a maximum radiological thickness change of 11.2 cm. Changing the definition of the materials comprising the phantom between water and plastic and tissue results in millimetre-scale changes to the resulting radiological thickness. When the entire phantom is defined as lead, this alteration changes the calculated radiological thickness by a maximum of 9.7 cm. Evidently, the simplification of the CT-density ramp has a greater effect on the resulting radiological thickness map than does the alteration of the assignment of tissue types. Conclusions: It is possible to alter the definitions of the tissue types comprising the phantom (or patient) without substantially altering the results of simulated portal images. However, these images are very sensitive to the accurate identification of the HU-density relationship. When converting data from a patient's CT into a MC simulation phantom, therefore, all possible care should be taken to accurately reproduce the conversion between HU and mass density, for the specific CT scanner used.

Introduction: Palliative radiotherapy calls are frequently required for emergency treatment of lesions for pain relief. Typically, the patient is planned and treated out of normal working hours by the on-call Radiation Therapist(s) who would need to CT scan the patient, plan the treatment, and then deliver the treatment. Often there is very few staff available to assist with lifting the patient who is likely to be bedridden. The advent of ConeBeam CT (CBCT) capabilities on the linac enables the imaging to be acquired on the same treatment couch as the treatment delivery with the patient in the same position.

Introduction: Radiotherapy is an important modality for treatment of cancer. A typical treatment program consists of daily sessions on a linear accelerator over a period of several weeks. To ensure the treatment is delivered as planned, the patient's treatment position has to be identically reproduced every time. Given the flexibility of the human body, this is no trivial task. This research aims to assist the radiation therapist (RT) in the daily patient set-up procedure using augmented reality. Methods: Treatment planning and delivery rely on 3D patient models based on computed tomography (CT) data sets of the patient. CT images represent a \"snapshot\" of the patient's anatomy at the time of the image acquisition. The main idea of this project is to extract the outer contour of the patient from the CT slices, and to augment the live image of the patient on the linear accelerator couch with the 3D patient contour. This enables the RT to visualise both the current patient position as well as the original one, which is to be reproduced. One of the main difficulties of the approach is to register the original 3D patient contour with the origin of the linear accelerator coordinate system. This point is known as the isocentre, which is where the radiation beams intersect as the linear accelerator gantry revolves around the patient. Since this is a virtual point in space, AR tracking markers cannot be attached directly to it. Moreover, there are no points on the linear accelerator that remain stationary with respect to the isocentre. As a solution to this, a small cube was constructed with tracking markers attached to the faces (figure 1). This cube can be aligned with lasers in the linear accelerator room (which intersect at the isocentre) and the coordinates of the AR system are set to match those of the cube. The system is calibrated this way and the cube is removed. Results and discussion: Using a small scale set-up in a lab environment with an ordinary web camera and three orthogonal laser beams, the position of the isocentre could be established with sub-millimetre accuracy. A small wooden statue with deformable limbs was used to investigate the system in terms of detecting both rigid and non-rigid position deviations. Small variations on the order of a millimetre could easily be visually detected. Further work includes testing the system in a clinical environment using the room surveillance cameras and real patients.

This paper describes an implantable telemeter designed to fulfill this niche. Methods: The telemeter measures blood pressure and SNA in vivo and transmits the recordings wirelessly to a base station. Blood pressure measurements are made using a fluid filled catheter (600\u021dm OD) connected to a silicon pressure sensor which is housed with in the telemeter. SNA is recorded using two 100 \u021dm diameter stainless steel electrodes coiled around the renal sympathetic nerve and sealed in place using silicon adhesive.

Introduction: Lymphoedema is a chronic disorder in which fluid, protein and fibre accumulate in the tissues due to the destruction of the lymphatic system. Over time the affected limb becomes abnormally larger, harder and gradually increases its resistance to indentation upon pressure. Appropriate treatment requires accurate diagnosis of the pathophysiologic changes. These changes can be monitored by the use of tonometry. Traditionally tonometry measures the resistance of tissues to compression, providing a measure of tissue hardness. However the traditional mechanical tonometer is often considered to be misleading, arbitrary and susceptible to the user's technique [1] . In addition the literature describes the tissue to have viscoelastic properties. These may be useful in monitoring Lymphoedema, which the mechanical tonometer is incapable of measuring. Methods: A viscoelastic tonometer was designed to measure the viscoelastic properties of the lymphoedema tissue. The tonometer is software controlled to indent the tissue at a fixed rate until 200g is applied to the tissue. The indentation depth is held for 10seconds and then retracted. During this test cycle the displacement into and the force of the tissue due to indentation is transmitted wirelessly to a computer and displayed and recorded for analysis.

Introduction: A clinical examination of the abdomen is performed as part of a routine physical examination, when a patient presents with abdominal pain or a history that suggests a possible abdominal pathology, or when there is suspected internal trauma. A clinician palpates the regions of the abdomen to feel for tenderness, guarding and underlying abnormalities. This involves both observing the patient's response and feeling the response of their abdomen to various applied pressures in the different regions. We aim to develop a simulator that can teach and train abdominal palpation examination skills by determining the applied force and position of an examiner's hand on a patient's abdomen. In order to incorporate the training of appropriate palpation forces into the design of the simulator, it was necessary to know the location and magnitude of typical forces applied to the abdomen during palpation. A search of the literature found only initial studies 1,2 on a limited number of test cases recording forces applied to the abdomen. Methods: Ethics approval was obtained to perform a pilot study in the South Australian Movement Analysis Centre to investigate the palpation examination forces applied to a subject's abdomen. For each trial, reflective markers were attached to the subject's abdomen and the clinician's dominant hand to track their motion with the infrared cameras in the VICON three dimensional motion analysis system while AMTI force plates recorded the force.

The palpation information recorded will be incorporated into the development of the simulator. Conclusions: Initial findings from the investigation into applied abdominal palpation forces show individual clinicians have consistent palpation technique with two distinct ranges in which light and deep palpation lie.

A representative set of measurements which should be conducted for validation is suggested and a procedure described for the refinement of a model to be commissioned for the purposes of beam characterisation and dose calculations. Introduction: Recent advances in the planning and delivery of radiotherapy treatments have resulted in improvements in the accuracy and precision with which therapeutic radiation can be administered. As the complexity of the treatments increases it becomes more difficult to predict the dose distribution in the patient accurately. Monte Carlo (MC) methods have the potential to improve the accuracy of the dose calculations and are increasingly being recognised as the 'gold standard' for predicting dose deposition in the patient [1] . This project has three main aims: 1. To develop tools that enable the transfer of treatment plan information from the treatment planning system (TPS) to a MC dose calculation engine. 2. To develop tools for comparing the 3D dose distributions calculated by the TPS and the MC dose engine. 3. To investigate the radiobiological significance of any errors between the TPS patient dose distribution and the MC dose distribution in terms of Tumour Control Probability (TCP) and Normal Tissue Complication Probabilities (NTCP). The work presented here addresses the first two aims. Methods: (1a) Plan Importing: A database of commissioned accelerator models (Elekta Precise and Varian 2100CD) has been developed for treatment simulations in the MC system (EGSnrc/BEAMnrc). Beam descriptions can be exported from the TPS using the widespread DICOM framework, and the resultant files are parsed with the assistance of a software library (PixelMed Java DICOM Toolkit). The information in these files (such as the monitor units, the jaw positions and gantry orientation) is used to construct a plan-specific accelerator model which allows an accurate simulation of the patient treatment field. (1b) Dose Simulation: The calculation of a dose distribution requires patient CT images which are prepared for the MC simulation using a tool (CTCREATE) packaged with the system. Beam simulation results are converted to absolute dose per-MU using calibration factors recorded during the commissioning process and treatment simulation. These distributions are combined according to the MU meter settings stored in the exported plan to produce an accurate description of the prescribed dose to the patient.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1594, "end": 1597, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "(2) Dose Comparison: TPS dose calculations can be obtained using either a DICOM export or by direct retrieval of binary dose files from the file system. Dose difference, gamma evaluation and normalised dose difference algorithms [2] were employed for the comparison of the TPS dose distribution and the MC dose distribution. These implementations are spatial resolution independent and able to interpolate for comparisons. Results and Discussion: The tools successfully produced Monte Carlo input files for a variety of plans exported from the Eclipse (Varian Medical Systems) and Pinnacle (Philips Medical Systems) planning systems: ranging in complexity from a single uniform square field to a five-field step and shoot IMRT treatment. The simulation of collimated beams has been verified geometrically, and validation of dose distributions in a simple body phantom (QUASAR) will follow. The developed dose comparison algorithms have also been tested with controlled dose distribution changes. Conclusion: The capability of the developed code to independently process treatment plans has been demonstrated. A number of limitations exist: only static fields are currently supported (dynamic wedges and dynamic IMRT will require further development), and the process has not been tested for planning systems other than Eclipse and Pinnacle. The tools will be used to independently assess the accuracy of the current treatment planning system dose calculation algorithms for complex treatment deliveries such as IMRT in treatment sites where patient inhomogeneities are expected to be significant.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 229, "end": 232, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE DEVELOPMENT OF MONTE CARLO TECHNIQUES FOR THE VERIFICATION OF RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENTS"}, {"text": "phantom. CT data of the thorax phantom was acquired to investigate doses in the target for all of these 3 energies. Usually, lung density is patient specific and may vary from patient to patient. The effect of lung density on the dose distribution was investigated for 4 different densities ranging from 0.12 to 0.30 g/cc. Dose volume histograms (DVHs) and a dose uniformity index (mean dose/minimum dose) were used to assess the changes. In all cases a phase space file of the LINAC with the 4cm cylindrical collimator was used to model the beam for the clinical setup. Results: DVH results demonstrated that the dose coverage of the GTV, PTV1 and PTV2 became worse with increasing beam energy and decreasing lung density. The dose uniformity of the GTV and PTV1 decreased exponentially with increasing energy with values for GTV of 0.98, 0.95, 0.93 and 0.91 for energies of 4, 6, 10 and 18MV respectively. However the dose uniformity in PTV2 increased with increasing energy. The dose uniformity in the GTV and PTV1 for different lung densities increased almost exponentially with increasing density and exponentially decreased for PTV2. Discussion and Conclusion: Monte Carlo modelling of beams used in stereotactic radiotherapy agreed well with measured data. Increasing beam energy to improve the dose uniformity of a PTV that includes a large volume of normal lung tissue actually results in poorer dose uniformity in the GTV. Therefore in a clinical setting it is better to create a plan using lower beam energies for a good coverage of dose to the target. The modelling with different lung densities suggests that there may be possible advantages to gating treatments to use a phase where the lung density is greatest. Ongoing work will use the Monte Carlo data to investigate the effect of energy on lateral electronic disequilibrium and dose conformity for small lung tumours. Introduction: The MammoSite \u00ae balloon is placed inside the breast surgical cavity and inflated with a combination of saline and radiographic contrast medium. The contrast medium contains elements with high atomic numbers, like iodine, and therefore the balloon mixture can not be considered tissue or water equivalent. At present, most brachytherapy treatment planning systems do not account for the inhomogeneities in dose calculations (Nath et al. 1995 Introduction: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SRT) use small radiation field sizes. For these fields an ideal detector would be a tissue equivalent material with good spatial resolution and high sensitivity, whilst being independent of energy, temperature, dose rate and orientation. Radiation dosimetry based on synthetic diamonds made through a Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) process, has initiated a growing interest in these detectors due to the availability of the relatively inexpensive synthetic diamond materials. Methods: We are developing a CVD diamond detector suitable for use in small radiation fields, with direct application in IMRT and SRT. Preliminary research includes examination of the optimal physical properties of the detector such as size, shape, doping impurity in the CVD diamond, electrode materials, and detector orientations by using EGSnrc Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Simulation parameters for modelling the synthetic diamond detector were investigated for a carbon thickness of 100Pm and electrode thickness of 0.1Pm using DOSXYZnrc code, an accompanying MC code for EGSnrc. DOSXYZnrc can simulate variable voxel sizes in a water phantom to determine the minimum voxel dimensions that could be modelled with low statistical uncertainty.

This has not yet been extended to the spin-echo (structural) T1-and T2-weighted MR images that are important clinically. This is largely due to the patient-to-patient variations in global signal levels that appear to be inherent to structural MR. In this work we describe a method to characterise the global signal level within the brain. We then adjust for global signal level in analysis of variance in a 3D comparison between two groups of subjects and compare our results with an alternative validated approach. Methods: Evaluation of the global signal level within the brain is here based on analysis of the histogram of voxel signal levels for each subject. Three measures of the global signal level based on linear fits to the leading and trailing slopes of the histograms of the T1-and T2-weighted MR images (after masking out of non-brain tissue) were considered. They were the zero crossings of the upslope (LoX), and the downslope (HiX) and the weighted mean (WM) computed using the histogram values above 50% of the histogram peak and the linear fits below. We incorporated these measures into an analysis of 30 subjects and 29 controls using SPM2 (statistical parametric mapping) by entering them as a nuisance covariate. This effectively adjusts for global intensity. The same analysis was performed, but using a global measure from an alternative method that has been validated (for T2) against T2 relaxometry (DF Abbott et al, \"Voxel Based Iterative Sensitivity analysis (VBIS): validation for T2 imaging of hippocampal sclerosis\", 2008, submitted for publication in NeuroImage).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "R.

SPM analysis using the validated VBIS global measure approach detected significant changes in the same locations at comparable statistical levels. Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely utilized medical imaging method, however one major disadvantage of MRI comparing to other competing methods such as computed tomography (CT) is the relatively long scan time. One effective method to shorten the scan time is to reduce the amount of necessary data acquisition, but it violates the conventional Nyquist sampling theory. Compressed sensing (CS) [1] is a recent development in information extraction theory that allows signal recovery from samples acquired at sub-Nyquist rate. The data acquisition nature of MRI lends itself naturally to the application of CS, and initial implementation has already demonstrated good evidence of success [2] . We demonstrate by incorporating a prior estimation of the imaged object, which is usually available, it is feasible to further improve the CS reconstruction in MRI.

What if we instead recover a signal R x that contains the same but reordered elements as x (think of a series of numbers and its ordered form)? This new R x can be formed to possess a greater level of sparseness (in ' R x ) that promises higher recovery accuracy. Eventually the recovered R x can be re-formed to x to gain a better reconstruction compared to the case of recovering x directly. Apparently this trick requires a prior ordering knowledge, which we propose can be gained from a low resolution approximation of x that is usually available in the pilot scan stage. Results and discussion: Shown in Fig.1 below are the image reconstructions of a healthy adult's brain (axial plane) using different techniques, in each case only 33% of the samples were acquired (corresponding to a 3-fold scan speed-up). It is seen that a direct inverse Fourier transformation (Fig. 1b) results in nasty aliasing artifacts as anticipated by the Nyquist's law. CS theory alone (Fig. 1c ) manages to recover most the image however it loses some fine detail (as arrowed) and image contrast.

The fluorometric systems used within this context generally incorporate relatively complex free space optical assemblies. In this paper, we describe a simple fibre optic fluorescence spectrometry system with a wide variety of biomedical applications. This low-cost, all-fibre system is portable, robust and has the capacity to acquire fluorescence spectra at rates up to 1 kHz. With minimal change in set up, the system can be used for a variety of fluorophores and to detect and distinguish multiple dyes simultaneously. We present measurements of action potentials (AP) in the di-4-ANEPPS stained heart and the concentration of GFP-tagged bacteria. Methods: A solid-state laser is injected into a 2x2 multi-mode fibre coupler. Half of the excitation light is guided to the sample while the other half is used for laser noise monitoring. The fluorescence from the illuminated sample is collected at the tip of the excitation fibre and returns to a compact fibre-coupled spectrometer via the 2x2 coupler and a laser line emission filter. Dichroic mirrors are not required because spectral decomposition is readily achieved in software. Results: Optical measurement of action potentials: Our system has been used to record APs in a Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart stained with di-4-ANEPPS. A dual-wavelength technique 1 was used to extract APs from successive timeresolved spectra taken at a fast sampling rate of 1 kHz. As shown in Fig. 1 , the extracted cardiac APs obtained have an acceptable SNR (~10) and exhibits the key features of the cardiac action potential. During each up stroke of the heart beat, spectral decomposition gives 40% more fractional fluorescence than a dichroic mirror configuration. In a dichroic configuration crosstalk between short and long wavelengths is inevitable as the transition between the bands is not sharp. Although this crosstalk can be minimised by adding bandpass emission filters, the fluorescence signal will be reduced resulting in poorer SNR. Detection of bacteria: Bioremediation is a process by which micro-organisms restore a contaminated environment to its original state. Although gaining popularity as a realistic remedial technique, it is hindered by the lack of effective, reliable, non-destructive, and in situ monitoring methods. 2 Here we propose to use our time-resolved fibre optic spectroscopic probe to acquire signal from fluorescent degrader bacterial species that are remotely observed in the immediate environment of the probe. Preliminary experiments were performed by using exactly the same setup as for the AP measurement. The laser source was switched from 532 nm to 473 nm and the emission and excitation filters were changed appropriately. Bacteria Salmonella enterica was tagged with a constitutively expressed GFP 3 and prepared in small vials at different concentrations. We have calculated that the minimum number of cells detected within the collection volume is as low as 6 proving the sensitivity of our probe. Moreover, the fluorescence intensity measured by the probe is linear against cell concentration, which demonstrates that the signal acquired by the fluorescence probe can be converted to a particular cell concentration. This information can be used to determine the biodegradation efficiency of the bacteria by monitoring their growth. Ultimately, bacteria can be tagged with GFP to report on the expression of bioremediation genes in situ to confirm the important bioremediation activities of bacteria.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2421, "end": 2422, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2922, "end": 2923, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1567, "end": 1573, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Reference:"}, {"text": "Our compact all-fibre fluorometric system has the capacity to resolve emission spectra in very small collection volumes using a range of different excitation wavelengths.

The increasing quantities and complexity of medical equipment is also greatly increasing the resources needed to support an annual based program covering all equipment. The use of Professional Risk Management is becoming well developed in many Health Systems to assist with prioritisation of activities. BTS is about to upgrade from ECRI-HECS to ECRI-AIMS. The time seems about right for BTS to investigate how to take the step to using a risk management approach in several aspects of its management of planned maintenance activity. Methods: Being good corporate citizens, it was decided to use the Queensland Health Risk Management Framework in the development of this approach. This uses a likelihood -consequence table to produce a five level risk result which then indicates the level of action and reporting required. The other given was the ECRI-AIMS clinical risk equation with allows five integer factors to be added together to give a risk score between 3 and 99. Two of the factors were used to enter the worst possible patient consequence (if Clinical Staff were not paying attention to equipment operation), and the likelihood of occurrence of such a failure if the maintenance was fully up to date. Other factors were used to indicate the level of maintenance generally applied to the device category, the relative reliability of models within the device category and particular circumstances that might raise or lower risk for individual pieces of equipment.

Dose enhancement factor were used to quantify the radiosensitisation for superficial x-ray, electron and photon beams radiotherapy. The effectiveness of the gold nanoparticles as the dose enhancers are also being tested for microbeam radiotherapy. Methods: Bovine Aortic Endothelial cells (BAECs) were irradiated with kilovoltage superficial x-ray, megavoltage electron beams and photon beams in the presence of various concentrations of AuNps (0.25 to 1 mMol). BAECs were cultured with AuNps 24 hours before irradiation and confocal microscopy image confirm that the AuNps were inside the cells during irradiation.

For megavoltage electron and photon beams, there are also dose enhancement but to a lesser extent. Dose enhancement also found to be optimum at 80 kVp with around 40 keV mean energy. Cytotoxicity tests showed that AuNps reduced the cells viability to 40 %.

AuNps also shows therapeutic advantages of microbeam radiotherapy where lower doses are required to treat tumours compared to the treatment without AuNps. Introduction: Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) achieves optimal dose conformity to the tumour, avoiding critical structures, through the use of spatially and temporally modulated radiation fields. The average dose-rate and instantaneous dose-rate (pulse amplitude) to a single voxel in the treatment volume, are highly variable within a single IMRT fraction. In this study we isolate these variables and determine their impact on cell survival. Methods: Two cell lines of differing radiosensitivity were examined; human melanoma (MM576) and non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H460).

Discussion: The results are relevant to IMRT practice, where average treatment times can be significantly extended to allow for transit motion of the MLC and beam positioning. Our in vitro experimental study adds to the pool of theoretical evidence describing the consequences of protracted treatments. We find that extended delivery times can substantially increase the cell survival. This also suggests that regional variation in the dose-rate history across a tumour, which is inherent to IMRT, will affect radiation dose efficacy. Conclusion: Temporal factors in radiation therapy have a significant effect oncell survival and ultimately on treatment outcome. Contemporary radiobiological models underestimate the importance of dose rate effects within the single fraction range.

It is now known that multiple mechanisms exist that can lead to cell death ('bystander' cell killing) and regulation, including the influence of signaling molecules generated distal to a particular cell. To explain experimental results, which challenge the conventional model, we have developed response models that incorporate response to communication signals generated non-locally. These models have been tested against our experimental results, enabling us to quantify the relative proportions of direct and bystander cell killing. Methods: Three models were considered. All included a direct radiation interaction as the primary cell killing mechanism, described by a linear-quadratic response. The models incorporate a secondary response to a bystander signal, where the signal was generated by the direct action of radiation via a lethal (Model 1), lethal or non-lethal (Model 2), or non-lethal (Model 3) interaction with another cell. The models were fitted to the experimental results for two cell lines, malignant melanoma (MM576) and non-small cell lung (NCl-H460), following uniform and non-uniform exposure. The model parameter values were then derived. Results: The experimental data was best fitted using Models 1 and 2 suggesting that the cell response to bystander signals is likely to be a lethal event. It was initially expected that Model 3 would provide a better fit since this model naturally leads to a saturation of bystander cell killing with increasing dose, an effect that has previously been observed in the context of alphairradiation experiments. The parameters extracted from the models can be used to quantify the physical mechanisms involved in direct and bystander-induced cell response. Fig. 1 shows an example of the contributions of cell killing to overall cell survival for the NCI-H460 cell line using Model 2. The gradient field experiments performed on the two cell lines represent ideal situations for investigating these models in that they allow separation of the direct and bystander survival components. The parameter values derived for the models identify the bystander signal as an important factor in determining the ultimate cell survival fraction.

Prior to site activation, a credentialing process will determine whether the site is eligible to participate in the trial.

Methods: Computer tomography (CT) image sets of two patients with early breast cancer treated with conservative surgery were selected for the planning study. The patients had a right-sided and a left-sided breast cancer, respectively, and one of the patients had surgical clips placed at the base of the surgical cavity. The patients were scanned within 12 weeks from surgery and the surgical cavities were visible.

However, the volumes of ipsilateral breast receiving a high (95%) or medium (50%) dose were reduced when identical outlines were used, as was the lung volume receiving 30% of the prescribed dose. In general, the variation of dose distributions achieved by different centres using identical outlines was found to be smaller than the variation in dose distribution when each centre developed their own outlines. Conclusions: Even in complex treatment plans such as the non-coplanar field arrangements used for 3D conformal partial breast irradiation, there is a significant influence of outlining practice on dose distribution. Given the additional variation in dose delivery introduced by contouring, quality assurance in clinical trials needs to carefully assess both, technical approaches and the contouring of relevant structures.

In these treatment approaches typically fractions of 10 to 20Gy are delivered to the target using extracranial 'stereotactic' approaches with many non-coplanar fields. A proposal has been presented to the Transtasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) to conduct a randomised trial of extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy for lung cancer (3 x 20Gy) compared to conventional fractionation (30 x 2Gy) delivered together with chemotherapy. Only patients with peripheral lesions will be eligible as the high dose per fraction has been shown to cause significant toxicity for targets close to vital structures. The novel treatment approach is technologically challenging and requires stringent quality assurance. The present paper describes the treatment techniques and provides some suggestions for technological solutions. Approach: There are several technological issues that must be considered in the proposed trial: 1. Treatment planning: The trial will require 8 or more non-coplanar non-opposing radiation fields of 6MV X-rays that should achieve a conformity index (volume covered by prescription isodose / PTV) of 1.3. IMRT will not be allowed initially because of its complexity, the dosimetric uncertainty with small field segments applied to a moving target in lung, the length of time required to deliver a high dose and the lack of established QA procedures within TROG. 2. Immobilization: Including image guidance, the delivery of a fraction of 20 Gy is expected to take more than 30 minutes. It will be essential to position the patient reproducibly and comfortably for treatment. At a minimum, immobilization should consist of a whole body vac-loc bag. 3. Motion management: In order to keep the dose to surrounding normal structures as low as possible it will be important to restrict the size of the internal target volume (ITV). Motion corrected data acquiring such as 4D CT will be required for treatment planning. Several methods can be used to address tumor motion: a. The motion is accounted for in an ITV without use of other motion correction methods -this is likely to be only successful for tumours with small motion. b. Abdominal compression can be applied to reduce motion. c. Radiotherapy can be delivered in a gated fashion. d. Tumour tracking may be employed. 4. Image guidance: It has been demonstrated that even with good immobilisation tumors can vary in position in relation to the bony anatomy from day to day. As such, image guidance will be mandatory. The imaging technology should have enough soft tissue contrast to be able to visualise the tumor itself. The use of implanted fiducial markers would be a good method to achieve this. In order to provide meaningful data for the overall treatment, we propose to acquire at least three image sets prior, in the middle and towards the end of treatment. Discussion: Hypofractionated radiotherapy for early stage lung cancer constitutes a significant change to conventional radiotherapy approaches. It has been used with excellent tumour control outcomes in North America, Japan and Europe. The trial proposed for Australasia through TROG explores this concept and its feasibility further by comparing it directly to chemoradiation as the best possible conventional approach. It is anticipated that the trial will recruit approximately 100 patients from multiple radiotherapy centres over 5 years. Given the high doses involved quality assurance will be essential and participating centres will be required to undergo a credentialing process. In addition to this site visits and real time review of participating patients are planned. Conclusions: The proposed trial will combine a variety of technologically advanced features of radiotherapy to deliver very high doses per fraction to lung cancer patients. The present paper will explore the technological challenges in this process and discuss methods to address them with the result that many radiotherapy centres in Australasia will be able to participate in the trial.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Figure 1.

Introduction: Monte Carlo simulation of contrast-detail experiments requires the simulation of about 10 11 photons. This places extreme demands on computing requirements. Only now do readily available computers have sufficient performance to accurately model such experiments in reasonable times. Such a simulation was used to study the effect of focal spot size on contrast-detail performance. Methods: The EGSnrcMP Monte Carlo code was used to model a digital radiography (DR) system. A contrast-detail pattern placed on a patient-equivalent-phantom was modelled. Simulation of the imaging system included the focal spot of the x-ray tube, couch top, anti-scatter grid, automatic exposure control (AEC) detector and image receptor. A number of simplifications were made in order to decrease the runtime. Three 2.5 GHz AMD Athlon computers were used, taking eight days CPU time per image. Images were produced for a range of focal spot sizes, four of each image being produced. These were scored by eight observers. Contrast-detail curves were plotted, which were analysed using a multivariate least-squares regression.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Laszlo Kotan Dynamic Controls Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand"}, {"text": "The results showed that despite the presence of scattered radiation and quantum noise in the images, a true point source produced the best image quality. The results were statistically significant. Discussion: It is often claimed that since diagnostic x-ray image quality is quantum limited, below a given focal spot size, no further improvement in image quality is possible by further reduction of the focal spot size. This assumption was shown to be incorrect. However, if the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) is redefined to be a system descriptor rather than just an image receptor descriptor, then the results of the experiment are found to be consistent with the theory. Conclusions: Monte Carlo simulation is a viable and very useful method for simulation of contrast-detail experiments and image production. Focal spot sizes cannot be chosen just on quantum noise arguments. Introduction: Gold Nanoparticles have been proposed as a new basis for contrast media in diagnostic radiology. Good Results have been obtained in a small animal study by Hainfeld et al. Their experimentation was conducted using mammographic imaging equipment. Although there has been some investigation into contrast-aided mammography, most procedures employing contrast agents utilize higher tube potentials to produce more penetrating x-rays. Methods: phantom was constructed from Perspex. This phantom featured cylindrical wells (4mm in diameter) to simulate a small portion of blood vessel. Each was loaded with either gold nanoparticle solution or iodinated CM at equal concentration (0.5077 M radiopaque element). This phantom was imaged under full scatter conditions in computed radiography (40-80 kVp) and computed tomography (80-140 kVp). Images analysed for by signal to noise ratio. These values were compared to theoretical signal values based on x-ray tube spectra collected by CdTe detector with MCA and known mass attenuation coefficients for bulk gold and iodine. Results: Image data was in close accordance with theoretical findings. At low diagnostic tube potentials, less than 50 kVp, gold nanoparticles displayed up to 60% greater signal-to-noise ratio than iodine. Gold nanoparticles were also particularly effective in CT imaging. At 140 kV, Gold nanoparticles produced over two times greater signal than iodine. At energies between 60 and 100 kVp, little difference in SNR was observed. CdTe attenuation spectra are in accordance with image results. Gold nanoparticles show a greater probability of attenuation than iodine for photons below approximately 35 keV and above 80 keV. Discussion: Data indicates a correlation with expected results. Low energy images show greater attenuation and subsequent signal using gold nanoparticle solution over iodinated CM. Here the probability of photoelectric effect is dependent on an atom's atomic number, giving gold a distinct advantage (Z Au =79, Z I =53). Gold nanoparticles were also particularly effective in CT imaging. At these potentials Compton scattering is the dominant x-ray interaction. Compton scattering relates to a materials physical and free electron densities. Gold has only a 50% greater physical density than iodine, but these findings suggest that there may be an increase in free electron density in gold nanoparticles due to quantum size effect, manifest as a Iodine decrease in binding energy of electrons on the large percentage of surface atoms. Images at angiographic tube potentials, however, displayed comparable contrast enhancement between both samples. This could be predicted from iodine's k-edge value at 33 keV, giving both materials similar attenuation coefficients for most of this energy range. Conclusion: Data indicates that a solution bearing gold nanoparticles would be an effective alternative to iodinated CM diagnostic radiology. Image contrast is comparable to iodine at angiographic tube potentials and improves significantly at mammographic and CT energy ranges The project has been undertaken in three phases. The first phase required re-surveying of radiation dose related parameters (DLP, CTDIvol) in addition to careful recording of patient size related parameters and technique factors for each examination. Phase 2 has involved attempts to optimize the radiation dose and technique across the three pilot sites. The optimization process involved a step wise process of (typically) mAs reduction under the watchful eye of a radiologist. This process is aided by our ability to perform inter-site technique comparisons. Phase 3 is a post adjustment re-survey. Comparison with patient related data recorded in Phase 1 provides some surety that the reported dose reductions are legitimate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "The Phase 1 radiation dose and technique survey showed median DLP at the highest dose site to be between 15 (head scans) and 139 (KUB studies) percent greater than at the lowest dose site, without substantial variations in average patient size or scan length. The main distinction in scan technique employed was the type of dose modulation utilized. For example, the abdomen scan technique involved both patient size (ACS) and Z axis (ZDOM) functions at GCH, whilst PAH and TH employed only angular modulation (DDOM) and ACS functions respectively. Preliminary phase 3 data at PAH shows median DLP reductions ranging from 38% for routine head, to more modest reductions of approximately 10% for body scans that employ Philips' dose modulation features. To date, body scan dose reductions have been constrained to that achieved by changes in the dose modulation function utilised eg. DDOM replaced with ACS and ZDOM. Discussion: Substantial dose reductions have been achieved for head examinations which utilize a fixed mAs scan technique without dose modulation of any kind. The \"optimized\" median DLP of 736mGy.cm compares favorably with published DRLs 1,2 , but remains clearly higher than that achieved by Heggie 1 , possibly due to the extended scan length technique employed (no head tilt) at PAH. Other optimization efforts have to date been limited to that achieved by changes in dose modulation method. Despite the assistance of local Philips staff, we are yet to devise a fool proof methodology for controlled dose reduction where the ACS system is active.

Introduction: The GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit is widely used in the medical physics community. It provides a set of predefined solids that can be combined with arithmetic and boolean operations to build very complex structures. With its capacity to build time-dependent geometries, Geant4 is well-suited for modelling dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy applications and also in organ motion studies. PET/CT and SPECT/CT have become more and more widely used in Nuclear Medicine and utilised in radiotherapy applications. CT provides the anatomical atomic density distribution in the human body and the SPECT and PET provide the radionuclide activity distribution within the organs at the time of scan. In internal emitter therapy and external beam radiotherapy applications, absorbed dose distribution is necessary to determine the dose to critical organs and hence to avoid organ toxicity. This research investigates whether the patient-specific density and radionuclide activity distribution could be used for accurate calculation of absorbed dose distribution in human body during the Nuclear Medicine imaging scans and internal emitting and external radiotherapy applications. We investigated several methods of converting CT numbers into mass density and elemental weight of tissues for dose calculation with GEANT4 based Monte Carlo simulation. Methods: An optimised fast Monte Carlo simulation was developed using VC++ to simulate particle transport across various atomic densities in the body using GEANT4 (version 9.1.p02) Monte Carlo code. DICOM CT images were used as the voxelized detector and the activity of the radionuclide was distributed in voxels according the pixel values in PET or SPECT images. The mass density distribution in the human body was obtained using a Hounsfield number to material conversion method. A material list according to the density range was built as given in ICRU report 46. A set of new materials was created for the voxels with the same material (within the range) but its mass density is in a different density interval to obtain the correct electron density value. The Hounsfield numbers were established with linear fit to eight intervals and electron densities of the human tissues and were created in 10 bins within a given interval. The relative absorbed energy distribution was obtained using the activity distribution which was estimated from 41 PET images. Total activity of 20 MBq was distributed across the voxels weighted according to pixel values. An image processing algorithm was used for segmenting the boundaries of the organs to calculate the dose distribution. Results: A simulation was carried out with 41 CT images as the detector and 41 PET images for estimating cumulative dose distribution during the period of the scan. Figure 1 shows the density distribution in the 11 th slice, and cumulative absorbed dose distribution in that slice is given in the Figure 3 . Figure 2 shows the activity distribution in the 1 st slice used in this simulation. Nearly 24 hours of computing time was required to simulate 20 million rays on a Windows Vista based 2.1 GHz mobile processor laptop computer with 2 GB RAM. Discussion: In nuclear medicine and radiotherapy applications, an event-by-event Monte Carlo method provides the most accurate dose calculations compared to analytical or kernel based Monte Carlo techniques. For a given pharmaceutical used in nuclear medicine, the activity concentration within the human body varied due to the physiological activities of the human tissues and the functions of the organs. The present simulation is limited to calculating the absorbed dose during the scanning period. The total absorbed dose could be estimated using kinetic models of the organ of interest. Different voxel navigation methods were investigated to suit the best speed and least memory usage so as to simulate a large data set using limited resources. Conclusions: This simulation can be extended for treatment planning systems in radiotherapy, brachiatherapy and internal emitting radiotherapy applications. The activity distribution varies with the physiological activities of the body. For accurate estimation of absorbed dose distribution in the human body resulting from varying activity distributions in organs and tissues, a series of simulations using sequentially acquired PET or SPECTS images is required. In the future research, we will validate the simulation with the published MIRD results. This simulation will provide tools for accurate estimation of absorbed dose in clinical applications. A full function IMRT LINAC was added to this simulation framework to calculate absorbed dose distribution in dynamic IMRT treatments.

This presentation provides a look at the current and future IHE PCD development activities, and looks at the last puzzle pieces that need to be added to complete the picture. This will include both anticipated technical components as well as business propositions. \"Infrastructure is a hard sell: Concentrated cost with diffuse benefit\" (Dr. Brailer); however, developments in national health programs and the ever spiraling costs of health care, are bringing about the demand for integrated solutions and broad application of health information technologies. Will this be enough though to reach the tipping point for deployment of open standards-based device connectivity? , Ultrasound Imaging Systems, pathology analysers, patient monitoring systems and others, which are used across the Health environment. This is increasing the need for a responsive support network to provide ICT services to the clinical environment. Biomedical Technology Services (BTS) currently do not have the resources to maintain databases, administrate web services, write interfaces to other systems, administer clinical information systems and to provide integrated ICT infrastructure to an enterprise environment controlled by another department. To bridge the gap between the clinicians and the Information Division, Biomedical Technology Services has initiated a formal working relationship with the Information Division to provide increased support in the clinical environment. Methods: A needs assessment was conducted with clinicians and biomedical staff to determine the business requirements with regards to the installation and support of IT based biomedical systems. A risk assessment was then completed to highlight past and future problems and possible actions that may prevent the problem. BTS then presented this risk assessment to ID where it was determined a formal partnership was required. Discussions were initiated with the Information Division to determine the best communications path and areas of greatest concern. ID and BTS then created an executive brief that commits the senior directors of both departments to sponsor this relationship. A formal document called the BTS ID relationships paper was then created to determine the terms of reference, address specific issues raised during the consultation phase and any further issues that needed to be addressed. This document was then circulated to all managers within BTS and ID for comment. Results: As this formal partnership has not been signed yet, the full effect of the engagement has not been realised.

Prior to the change, extensive in-service training of the nursing staff was carried out. The Plum A+ pumps incorporate \"MedNet\" dose error reduction system which aims to reduce infusion errors. The software allows for libraries of drugs and doses which are specific to designated clinical areas. For a specific area, the library contains a list of common drugs with their normal maximum and minimum dose limits. Soft limits can be overridden, after a warning, as particular circumstances require, but hard limits cannot be exceeded. The wireless network, previously installed in the hospital, was available for pump communication. Each infuser incorporates a wireless 802.11 a/b/g module communicating over the 2.4GHz band with WPA2 encryption. Each pump needed configuration for communication with the network. Asset numbers and serial numbers were loaded at this stage to associate with the MAC address of each unit. Another task, which took some time, was to map the geographical areas in the hospital with the MAC addresses of the wireless access points (WAP). The MedNet software and drug dose library are maintained on a dedicated server. The drug library was prepared by nursing and pharmacy staff. The drug dose library was loaded into the pumps via the network. Discussion: The system implemented allows updated drug libraries to be downloaded to the pumps as required and provides web access to a great deal of information. When new drugs are to be made available, or drug dose protocols are revised, a new drug library can be down loaded, remotely, to all pumps which have wireless communication.

Dysrhythmic gastric electrical activity (GEA) is associated with common and highly symptomatic conditions such as gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. Non-invasive recording of GEA by electrogastrography (EGG) is unable to determine abnormal propagation of GEA or electrical uncoupling. Endoscopic measurement is limited by the inferior conductance of GEA through the inner mucosal layer. An alternative is to measure GEA directly from the stomach's outer serosal surface. Our aim was to develop a minimally invasive approach to the measurement of GEA and to demonstrate its validity in a porcine model. Methods: Device design: An array of five closely-spaced electrode heads were constructed from 300 micron silver wire set in a 5 mm diameter epoxy resin platform. The five electrodes joined stainless steel connecting wires, which were set into a laparoscopic sleeve layered with Teflon and silicone glue, followed by a cable tube of silicone over copper shielding, and finally to a bayonet jack and socket connector set. It was designed for repeated sterilisation by ethylene oxide. In-vivo validation: Two weaner pigs underwent general anaesthesia and midline laparotomy. Simultaneous recordings were obtained from cutaneous EGG, a high-density 4x8 electrode array placed on the serosal surface of the gastric antrum, and the novel laparoscopic device, the tip of which was positioned 25mm proximal to channel 32 of the high-density array on the serosa of the gastric corpus. All data was acquired through the ActiveTwo System (Biosemi) and filtered using a 2 nd order Bessel filter with a cut-off frequency of 2 Hz. The five channels from the laparoscopic device were averaged and compared with the EGG and high-density array recordings. Timing of a GEA event (slow wave) was established by point of the most negative gradient. Validation of true slow wave recording was performed by event concordance with the two other recognised methods, and detection of appropriate 'lag' (slow wave velocity is approximately 4-5mm/s for this region of porcine stomach; corpus measurement should precede antral measurement). Results: GEA was immediately and continuously recorded by all three methods with good concordance (Figure 2 ). An appropriate lag of 5.1s was measured between slow waves registered from the novel laparoscopic device (corpus) and channel 32 of the array (antrum).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2365, "end": 2374, "text": "(Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Introduction:"}, {"text": "Discussion: Our novel laparoscopic device (we have labelled it the 'Lammer's Wand') effectively recorded slow waves with acceptable quality.

The device will make it possible to laparoscopically investigate the nature, prevalence and clinical importance of GEA dysfunctions, and in the future may find therapeutic application alongside gastric electrical stimulation therapies. Conclusions: A new device for the laparoscopic measurement of GEA is presented. It has undergone in-vivo validation in a porcine model. Introduction: The Two-Part Nail (TPN) is a new intramedullary device for the fixation of pathological fractures due to tumours in long bones. Unlike traditional intramedullary (IM) nails the TPN is inserted in two halves proximally and distally through the fracture site which has already been opened to remove the tumour. This makes creation of another insertion point unnecessary, reducing surgical trauma. The two nail halves are connected in vivo by the surgeon and reinforced by a PMMA bone cemented joint. Bone cement is routinely used to fill the defect caused by the tumour. The design of the connector is the focus of this project. A pilot study was devised to determine whether the stiffness required to provide pain relief could be achieved through the support of the cemented joint in isolation regardless of connection design. This would determine whether connection stiffness or simplification of surgical procedure would be a primary design objective. This study further investigated the effect of circumferential grooves on the mechanical properties of the cemented joint. Methods: Three groups of five samples each were tested. The test samples were constructed from 10mm Delrin rod with three milled, longitudinal grooves as per the current one-part nails. The test sample groups were;", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Figure 2.

The bone cement was mixed by hand without a vacuum mixer. The cement mantle formed around the connection was 30mm long with a uniform radial thickness of 2mm. The samples were tested in torsion over 10 cycles to a strain of 5 degrees and back to zero strain, with a loading rate of 1 deg/s. This allowed the recording of torsional stiffness as well as conditioning the samples to approximately simulate physiological loading. The samples were then tested in four-point bending (inner span 50 mm, span ratio 3:1). Loading was at 0.5mm/s up to 22mm deflection, the maximum possible in this rig without impingement. The cement sprue was oriented to point upwards (as shown in fig. 1 below) in order to minimise the effect of the sprue on the mechanical properties of the cement mantle. Results: There was a significant increase in stiffness for plain cemented samples over solid rods in torsion (13% mean difference P=0.00006) and bending (12% mean difference P=0.003). However there was no significant difference in stiffness either in torsion (P=0.868) or bending (P=0.743) between the plain and grooved cemented samples. The grooved samples were stronger than the plain samples (16% mean difference, P=0.0003), but both were weaker than the solid rods which did not fracture at the maximum possible deflection. The joined rods failed by fracture of the cement mantle, on the upper or tensile side of the rod. Discussion: The most important parameter for these implants is the stiffness in torsion and bending, as stiffness leads to pain relief. Because it is not expected that these implants will fail catastrophically, the absolute strength of the connection is relatively unimportant. As these rods are used for palliative surgery in patients with limited life expectancy, fatigue life is a lesser consideration. The applicability of these results depends upon the surgeon's ability to form a cement mantle of sufficient thickness and uniformity. Further studies to determine the effect of poor cement technique are planned, along with Finite Element Analysis of connector designs and the effect of varying cement mantles. Conclusions: It has been shown clinically that full length Delrin rods are stiff enough to provide pain relief. These results then indicate that the TPN with a cement mantle is stiff enough to provide pain relief. Because of this the primary design criterion becomes simplification of surgical procedure. As the circumferential grooves do not increase the stiffness of the nail and the strength is relatively unimportant, the additional manufacturing complication they cause precludes their use in the design. Introduction: Diamond is a potential detector material for dosimetry applications; it is radiation hard, chemically inert and non-toxic, and has near-tissue equivalence (Z = 6, c.f. Z \u00a7 7.3 for tissue). Diamond detectors are commercially-available 1 . These detectors utilise natural diamonds specially chosen for their properties, contributing to the high price and long lead times associated with purchase of these detectors. In contrast, synthetic diamond is significantly cheaper and its properties, which can be tailored during synthesis, are more reproducible. However, synthetic diamond still suffers from defects/trap states, which give rise to undesirable device characteristics, such as the need to prime the device (expose the device to a certain dose prior to use as dosimeter); for example see references [2] [3] [4] [5] . Methods: Prototype detectors have been fabricated from a variety of commercially-available synthetic diamond films grown using chemical vapour deposition. These devices have been exposed to 6 MV photon beams from a Varian 600C linear accelerator. A Farmer 2570/1 dosimeter and a Keithley 6430 source meter unit have been used to measure the detection characteristics of these devices. Measurements have been taken using a Perspex build-up cap and using a solid water phantom; device performance has been compared to an ionisation chamber. Results: Current values up to a few nanoamperes have been measured for typical bias voltage levels (100-250 V). Figure 1 (a) shows the amount of charge integrated over 10 seconds using the Farmer 2570/1 dosimeter for photon beams of different dose rates; the device has not been primed, is surrounded by an air cavity inside a Perspex build-up cap, and is biased at 247.75 V using the Farmer dosimeter. Discussion: An increase in the current through the detector (and hence the amount of charge integrated) is obvious when the detector is exposed to the photon beam. However, the dark current appears to be reducing with exposure of the detector, and there is an initial overshoot when the photon beam is turned on with an exponential decay before reaching a steady state. Increasing the dose rate increases the current in the detector; the photocurrent appears to obey a power law equation in agreement with theory 6 (see fig. 1 (b)). The detector shows no significant angular dependence, as shown in fig. 1 (b); 0 degrees indicates the detector face-on to the photon beam with irradiation through the positively-biased contact, 180 degrees face-on through the negatively-biased contact, and 90 degrees with the detector edge-on. Conclusions: Diamond demonstrates potential for use as a viable dosimeter. However, there exist several issues, such as the need for priming, which need to be resolved.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3778, "end": 3781, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3782, "end": 3785, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3786, "end": 3789, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3790, "end": 3793, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 998, "end": 1004, "text": "fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 4447, "end": 4455, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 5258, "end": 5264, "text": "fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 5337, "end": 5343, "text": "fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "DESIGN OF A POLYMERIC TWO-PART INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL"}, {"text": "Modern techniques in a clinical environment such as radiation therapy demand superior instrumentation in order to assure that the radiation that patients receive is optimal. A promising material for radiation detection is the use of diamond, primarily due to its near-tissue equivalence (carbon), and that it is chemically inert, non-toxic and highly resistant to radiation. Unfortunately, the advantages of natural diamonds are offset mainly by their high cost as well as poor reproducibility due to the scarcity of suitable gems of consistent quality. Recent progress in synthetic diamonds obtained by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) poses to eliminate such dilemmas. The focus of the current project is to evaluate the suitability of CVD diamonds as radiation detectors and to validate them for use in a clinical setting. Methods: Several prototype detectors have been fabricated in order to test various device parameters relevant to clinical dosimetry. Perspex build-up caps and wax were used to encapsulate the metallized films and these were irradiated in a Solid Water phantom using a 6 MV photon beam from a Varian 600C Clinac. Relative dose linearity and sensitivity of response were investigated to quantify characteristics and comparisons against a 0.6 cc Farmer ion chamber in a Solid Water phantom. Photocurrents were typically integrated over small time intervals using a 2570/1 Farmer Dosemeter. A Keithley 6430 SourceMeter using LabVIEW was also used for a variety of other, more precise measurements. Results: Fig. 1 illustrates some results from a 200-\u03bcm polycrystalline film with a sensitive volume of 0.63 mm 3 that was exposed to 6 MV photons at 2.5 Gy/min at 90\u00b0 or an \"edge-on\" configuration.

Discussion: Exponential saturation of dose was observed during repeated exposures. Priming of about 40 Gy was needed in order to achieve some sort of stability, but was expected given the overall quality of the sample. The exponential rise or decay of sensitivity also changed in behaviour and magnitude as a function of applied electric field, where different rise times and an initial \"overshoot\" of photocurrent were observed.

However, a second sensitivity exposure will detect any non-linearity in response over the dose range. Introduction: Out-of-field radiation is important in terms of its potential for late effects such as radiation induced carcinogenesis, heart disease, respiratory problems and many others. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) typically employs a greater number of monitor units than conformal therapy, potentially increasing such risks. IMRT delivery at the William Buckland Radiotherapy Centre (WBRC) employs a BrainLAB m 3 \u2122 mini-multileaf collimator (MMLC) in sliding window mode with a static jaw field opening of 9.8 x 9.8 cm 2 , mounted on a 6 MV Varian 600C. Treatment planning systems (TPS) are normally commissioned using measured data that extend only a few centimetres beyond the field edge, with penumbra defined as 80 % to 20 % of the maximum dose for the field. Dose extending outside the field is not intended to be used for the overall calculation of the dose distribution or contribute to the inverse optimisation procedure. Therefore, one would expect the dose distributions predicted by the iPlan TPS to be inaccurate in regions far from the primary field. In this study we compare doses determined by iPlan to measurements and Monte Carlo calculations of out-of-field doses corresponding to a range of fields shaped by the MMLC. Methods: Dose points were measured with IC3 and IC13 ionisation chambers (Wellh\u00f6fer, Schwarzenbruck, for smaller and larger fields, respectively) at various points in a water chamber (positioned asymmetrically) up to 45 cm from the isocenter. A range of field sizes were employed along with variation of other parameters, such as source-surface distance and depth in water, so as to determine the factors of greatest influence and establish relationships with dose. The doses at these positions were also calculated with BrainLAB iPlan. A model of the Varian 600C with mounted BrainLAB MMLC was modelled using BEAMnrc, and dose points at the same locations were calculated in a voxelated water phantom via Monte Carlo radiation transport. Results and Discussion: Figure 1 shows the relative dose for a range of field sizes up to an off-axis distance of 45 cm, as measured with IC13 and IC3 ionisation chambers. The TPS calculates dose points such that for the 2.4 x 2.4 cm 2 , 5 x 5 cm 2 and 9.8 x 9.8 cm 2 fields, the 0.1% isodose lines extend to 5, 10 and 20 cm respectively. The measurements show dose values falling from 0.1% at 20cm to slightly more than 0.01% at 45cm. Therefore, the TPS effectively does not take into account 0.01% dose outside 10cm of the isocenter for small fields. For a 20 Gy hypo-fractionated treatment, dose to peripheral regions is on the order of cGy which is a significant dose in radiological protection. Initial Monte Carlo results generally agree with these results.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 18, "end": 26, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2407, "end": 2415, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction:"}, {"text": "There is a predicted discrepancy between the out-of-field doses calculated by iPlan and those found experimentally.

Introduction: Endorectal balloons are utilised for prostate cancer external beam radiotherapy in a number of institutions as a means of immobilizing the prostate and reducing the volume of the rectal wall receiving high doses [1, 2] . The use of endorectal balloons during treatment delivery has been shown to decrease the delivered rectal dose, leading to decreased toxicity [3] . Air is used to fill the balloon to a volume of 60cm 3 at the University of Wisconsin hospital. This gives a toroid shaped air cavity immediately adjacent to the target with a diameter of approximately 5cm and a thickness of 3cm. This volume of air will perturb the dose distribution in the surrounding tissue.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the Western World, is on the increase in males and is the leading cause of cancer-related death in females in Australia. Early detection is the best protection for breast cancer. Currently mammography is the gold standard screening technique but it misses 15-20% of breast cancers because they have low X-ray contrast to the surrounding soft tissue, it is unable to adequately detect breast tumours close to the chest wall and upper arm and suffers from a high false positive rate, with only 10% of biopsies being malignant. Recently, microwave imaging for breast cancer detection has gained attention due to advances in imaging algorithms, microwave hardware and computational power. The breast is relatively translucent to microwaves, accessible for imaging, and there appears to be significant electromagnetic contrast between tumours and healthy tissues. The method is attractive to patients because both ionizing radiation and breast compression are avoided, resulting in safer and more comfortable exams. Microwave breast tumour detection has the potential to be both sensitive and specific, to detect small tumours in the early stages of development and possibly able to determine whether a suspicious area is malignant or benign. It is also quick and less expensive than methods such as MRI and nuclear medicine.

A quantitative comparison, using statistical parametric mapping (SPM), of brain SPECT from two groups of normal controls acquired on the same 3-head gammacamera but 3 years apart showed significant unexpected differences. We have shown elsewhere that the distinctive asymmetry of these changes could be simulated by imposing in one group a 10% decrease in sensitivity in one of the three camera heads (L Barnden. IEEE NSS-MIC Conference Record 2007). Here we describe detection and correction of inter-head sensitivity differences in individual scans. Methods: Relative sensitivity changes between the three heads within individual patient scans were detected from analysis of the variation with acquisition angle in the total decay-corrected counts. This variation is caused by differential attenuation at different angles. Its curve should be smoothly varying and should be closely approximated by the sum of its first few cosine basis functions. To estimate the sensitivity differences between camera heads, we applied a downhill simplex iterative adjustment of the sensitivity of each head to minimise a cost function -the mean absolute difference between the adjusted curve and the fitted sum of its first 3 (or 4 or 5) cosine basis functions. The method was validated by simulating sensitivity changes on noisy constant sensitivity projections and applying this technique to measure them. An initial survey of inter-head sensitivity differences was performed over 7 years of SPECT acquisitions on the same 3-head camera. The sensitivities thus obtained were also used to correct the acquired SPECT projections and, for the same two groups of normal controls, their reconstruction was repeated and SPM analysis performed to detect any residual differences. Results: We show that, for typical SPECT acquisitions, this method can reliably detect sensitivity differences of 1% between heads. The review of scans since 2000 revealed typical maximum inter-head sensitivity differences of 4%. In one period of 2 months, this increased to 25% without being detected in the clinical scans or by routine QA. In another period of 9 months, scans acquired within days of each other showed maximum sensitivity differences varying by a factor of 3 and in some scans the sensitivity in one head appeared to drift within the scan.

The method eliminated a significant SPM difference between two groups of scans. This method promises to be a useful QA tool for quantitative multi-head SPECT. Introduction: Laser speckle contrast analysis is a useful and convenient non-contact method of generating dermal perfusion information. The information relates to the flux of red blood cells into the dermis. It is closely related to optical Doppler measurements using fibre probes, but unlike that technique, can produce images of skin areas, rather than point measurements of perfusion. The method dates to the late 1970's, when photographic images were used, but developments in lasers, digital cameras and computer technology over recent years have encouraged speckle methods to be revisited. Inexpensive and convenient systems, capable of producing perfusion images in real time have been developed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BREAST CANCER DETECTION AND IMAGING WITH MICROWAVES"}, {"text": "The IRL laser speckle imaging system uses a CCD camera, a thermo-electrically cooled diode laser and a PC running custom software.

By excluding gross movements using control measurements, and as the laser speckle at visible wavelengths is dominated by near-surface tissue, we can confirm that we are measuring pulsatile flow in the dermal capillaries. Figure 1 shows a speckle contrast record measured through the toenail. The pulse is clearly visible in this record, though there is also a random noise component. By establishing the pulse positions in the record using a filtered version of this signal, we can overlay a number of pulses and calculate a statistical average pulse shape. Figure 2 shows example mean pulse shapes for two people. The flow is consistently repeatable for Subject 2 and significantly different for Subject 1. To produce a perfusion index comparable to laser Doppler flowmetry, we use a multiple-exposure technique. The perfusion index produced is proportional to the concentration and mean velocity of the red blood cells in tissue. Figure 3 shows an example of the Perfusion Index (P.I.) measured over 5 minutes following vasodilation induced by hot water. Conclusions: Speckle contrast analysis is now sufficiently fast to measure the waveform of pulsatile flow in the dermal capillaries, something which may have clinical applications.

Tight glycaemic control is associated with significantly improved patient outcomes. However, providing tight control is difficult due to evolving patient condition and interactions with common drug therapies resulting in recurring hyperglycaemic episodes. Quantifying the impact of drug therapies on blood glucose and metabolic control would enable optimised delivery of these drugs and facilitate tight control. This research quantifies the impact of common steroid and inotrope drug therapies on a clinically validated measure of metabolic function -insulin sensitivity -over the critical first 2 days of ICU patient stay. The goal is to quantify the impact of these common drug therapies on the ability to provide tight control and thus balance these affects clinically.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DRUG THERAPY AND (MODEL-BASED) METABOLIC MARKERS: IS TIGHT GLUCOSE CONTROL IN CRITICAL CARE AFFECTED BY DRUG CHOICES?"}, {"text": "A clinically validated, model-based measure of insulin sensitivity (S I ), is used as the marker of metabolic function. Blood glucose, insulin and nutrition data from 53 hyperglycaemic subarachnoid haemorrhage patients who received steroids (dexmethasone) and/or inotropes (noradrenaline) in the Christchurch ICU from 2003-2007 were used to determine S I over the first 48 hours of stay. This cohort possesses little co-morbidity so changes in S I can be assumed due to the drug therapies alone. Patients were classified on outcome (survivors, non-survivors) and therapy (steroids, inotropes, both or neither). S I is compared over 48 hours for each of the 8 patient groups. Results: Four main results emerged: 4. Insulin sensitivity increases gradually for all patients over the 48 hour period (p < 0.05) 5. Insulin sensitivity was significantly suppressed in survivors given steroids (versus survivors not given steroids), by a factor of approximately 2x (p < 0.005) 6. Inotropes had no significant affect on the change in S I over time regardless of outcome 7. Insulin sensitivity was always suppressed in all non-survivors regardless of drug therapy. Discussion: Suppressed insulin sensitivity appears to be a consistent marker of mortality and it is of particular concern that steroids cause similar suppression. These results may also indicate the reason that many studies on steroid administration report mixed reports with respect to mortality. Finally, a reduction of 50% in insulin sensitivity for patients on steroids will also have a significant impact on the tight glucose control regime and effort required to maintain euglycaemia, creating a much more difficult clinical control problem. Conclusion: Model-based metabolic markers (S I ) can provide significant insight into the clinical impact of common critical care drug therapies. The initial results from this study will begin to enable clinicians to optimise the tradeoffs between tight glycaemic control and the metabolic impact of steroid and inotrope drug therapies. Introduction: A significant number of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) require some form of respiratory support. In the case of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the patient often requires full intervention from a mechanical ventilator. ARDS is also associated with mortality rate as high as 70%. Despite many recent studies on ventilator treatment of the disease, there are no well established methods to determine the optimal Positive End expiratory Pressure (PEEP) ventilator setting for individual patients. A model of fundamental lung mechanics is developed based on capturing the recruitment status of lung units. The model produces good correlation with clinical data, and is clinically applicable due to the minimal number of patient speci\u00bfc parameters to identify. The ability to use this identi\u00bfed patient speci\u00bfc model to optimize ventilator management is demonstrated. This minimal model also provides a clinically useful, simple platform for continuous monitoring of lung unit recruitment for a patient.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "The main bjective of this research is to develop the simplest possible model that is also clinically e\u011bective. The model presented represents the lung as a collection of lung units. A lung unit corresponds to sets of distal airways and attached alveoli. The lung is divided into several \"horizontal\" compartments to simulate different level of superimposed pressures. The compartment at the bottom experiences higher superimposed pressure than the ones above due to the weight of the lung. Recent studies suggest that recruitment and derecruitment is the dominant cause of volume change, rather than isotropic, \"balloon like\", expansion of alveoli as had been traditionally thought. The model developed thus consists of lung units with only two possible states: recruited or not recruited. The recruitment and derecruitment of the modelled lung units are controlled by the distribution of Threshold Opening Pressure (TOP) and Closing Pressure (TCP), respectively. Threshold pressures are assumed to follow a normal distribution along pressure based on studies in the literature. Once a lung unit is opened, it assumes a volume defined by a unit compliance curve. The unit compliance is based on a sigmoid curve. A total of four variables are used to capture the essential features of the measured pressure volume curves: TOP distribution mean and standard deviation, and TCP distribution mean and standard deviation. These parameters are effectively two each for the inflation and deflation limbs. Other variables, such as PEEP, PIP, and tidal volume are assumed known as they are set by the clinician or can be obtained directly from the ventilator. Results: The model is validated by fitting and predicting with clinical PV data of 4 patients at different PEEP levels. The TOP and TCP parameters were fit parametrically. Data from di\u011berent PEEP settings of the same patient were \u00bftted by shifting the distribution mean value, while other parameters were \u00bfxed. Prediction is done by using data from 2 PEEP settings to predict the third, or by using data from 3 PEEP settings to predict the fourth. For the four patients the overall average absolute error in the pressures varied from 15.92 ml (1.81%) to 20.65 ml (3.41%) for inflation and 36.63 (4.08%) to 41.06 ml (7.18%) for deflation. Note that the prediction only occurred in the steady portion of the curve to avoid the transition regions. Discussion: The shifting of the means of the TOP and TCP normal distributions while keeping standard deviation fixed, gave good matches to the clinical data. A mean shift represents the e\u011bect of the dynamic mechanism of lung units at di\u011berent PEEP values. More speci\u00bfcally, once a collapsed lung unit is recruited, it does not necessarily collapse again at the same pressure at which it was recruited. Instead, it stays recruited at a lower pressure. This e\u011bect is especially signi\u00bfcant in the ARDS lung because of the reduced number of functional lung units and lower compliance of the overall lung. The bene\u00bft of recruitment manoeuvres on ventilated patients is based on this dynamic. The methods also allowed a good prediction of lung response to data not used in the identication. Therefore, there is a potential to use the model to trial and test various PEEP settings before application to the patient. Another benefit of this approach is to provide constant monitoring for a patient's level of lung recruitment, and thus the level of ARDS and the impact of therapy as the patient's condition evolves. Conclusion: A minimal model of the mechanics of a ventilated lung is developed. It employs only 2 unique parameters for each limb of the breathing cycle. The model was validated by fitting to clinical data and predicting lung response to various PEEP settings. These initial results show that the model could be used to both monitor a patients condition and predict PEEP therapy response. Longer term this approach may lead to improved management of ARDS in critical care. Introduction: Opioids, commonly used for post-operative pain relief, can cause respiratory depression in 0.1-1% patients with subsequent hypoxia. Timely detection of this loss of airway tone would be useful in preventing damage to these patients. The major effect of opioids is directly on the central nervous system with decreases in sympathetic activity, reduction in parasympathetic activity and vagal tone. Specifically for this study, opioids affect respiratory drive & rhythm; decreased activity in motor neurons driving respiration is modulated by ANS respiratory centres. Respiratory modulation is reflected in heart rate changes creating the possibility that the opioid effect could be measured by monitoring heart rate variability, HRV. HRV uses changes in heart rate to indirectly observe changes in the activity of the autonomic nervous system and in particular, the changes in activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches. Methods: This pilot study investigated the ability of very short term (30 sec) heart rate variability to predict the occurrence of loss of airway tone in patients administered with fentanyl pre-operatively. While many HRV indices are correlated, this investigation used the major HRV indices (e.g. SDNN, rMSSD, pNN50), and Poincare indices that are known not to be correlated with these major indices.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "Results: Loss of airway tone could not be predicted using the major HRV indices, nor with uncorrelated Poincare indices.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PREDICTING FENTANYL-INDUCED LOSS OF AIRWAY TONE WITH POINCARE INDICES"}, {"text": "Fentanyl causes respiratory depression through modulation of the ANS respiratory centres however very short term measures of HRV are not sensitive enough to these modulations to predict the loss of airway tone. Introduction: Brain disorders can decrease a person's ability to perform the physical and cognitive functions necessary for safe driving. A computerized battery of sensory-motor and cognitive tests (SMCTests) has been developed comprising tests of visuoperception, visuomotor ability, complex attention, visual search, decision-making, impulse control, planning, and divided attention. This study investigated the power of binary logistic regression (BLR) and nonlinear causal resource analysis (NCRA) models to classify blinded on-road pass or fail in a large group of people with brain disorders referred to the Driving and Vehicle Assessment Service (DAVAS) at Burwood Hospital. Methods: Two-hundred referrals to DAVAS with brain disorders were recruited and their performance on SMCTests and a blinded on-road assessment determined. Referrals had definite or suspected brain disorders, comprising stroke (n=61), agerelated substantive cognitive decline (n=55), dementia (n=43), traumatic brain injury (n=21), Parkinson's disease (n=8), brain tumour (n=3), and other brain disorder (n=9). Figure 1 shows the SMCTests apparatus at Burwood Hospital. Forwardstepwise BLR and NCRA predictive models based on SMCTests performance were developed to classify blinded on-road driving performance for the whole referral group and for different diagnostic subgroups. Results: Both BLR and NCRA models were able to classify on-road pass or fail for the whole referral group with an accuracy of 69.5%. Greater accuracy could, however, be achieved by splitting the referrals into two groups: (1) Dementia (dementia or age-related substantive cognitive decline) and (2) Non-dementia (all other brain disorders). The BLR models classified on-road driving outcome as pass or fail with accuracies of 76% (Dementia) and 75% (Non-dementia), while the NCRA models had accuracies of 77% (Dementia) and 80% (Non-dementia). The Discussion: For both dementia and non-dementia groups, NCRA identified the same measures as predictive of on-road driving as BLR but was able to identify and use additional measures to improve accuracy. NCRA appears better able to accommodate outliers due to it being a non-linear modelling method based upon individual performance-limiting impairments. Measures of attention (complex and divided) were important for predicting on-road driving in both diagnosis groups but were most critical in the dementia group. This indicates a greater emphasis on attention deficits, rather than physical function, in the dementia group. In the non-dementia group, prediction of on-road driving was most accurate with assessment of a broader range of sensory-motor and cognitive functions. Conclusions: Predictive models which emphasize assessment of attention deficits are more accurate for predicting on-road driving in people with dementia. Predictive models which include a broader assessment of sensory-motor, cognitive, and coordinated sensory-motor and cognitive function are more accurate for predicting on-road driving in people with a variety of other brain disorders such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. However, while SMCTests provides useful data regarding areas of sensory-motor and cognitive dysfunction in people with brain disorders, an on-road assessment is still required to make a final decision regarding on-road driving safety. Further research is required to identify other factors which underlie inability to drive safely in people with brain disorders and which may increase the accuracy of predictive models. Other factors must be either (1) sensory-motor and/or cognitive deficits not currently being fully assessed or (2) unrelated to sensory-motor or cognitive functions (e.g., attitude, confidence, insight, driving skills, road code knowledge).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2115, "end": 2118, "text": "The", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1303, "end": 1311, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion:"}, {"text": "Lan Methods: This new device can measure and store force and ROM measurements simultaneously.

Particle bunches containing about 10**9 protons are bought into collision at the rate of 40 MHz producing around 1000 particles every 25 ns.

Higher concentrations of oxygen are usually administered during general anaesthesia, and are measured using a fuel cell or paramagnetic analyser. During normal inspiration, air is drawn into the lungs by increasing the intrathoracic volume and making the intrathoracic (and therefore alveolar) pressure subatmospheric. The situation is completely different during anaesthetic or ICU ventilation where positive pressure ventilation is usually used. During inspiration, the atmospheric air is warmed and humidified in the upper airways, resulting in a reduction in the pO 2 to 150 mmHg. During anaesthesia, a heat and moisture exchange filter (HMEF) is used to reduce heat and water loss. By the time the air gets to the alveoli (the tiny air sacs where gas exchange takes place), the partial pressure of oxygen has dropped to approximately 100 mmHg, mainly because of dilution by carbon dioxide which is being transferred from the blood into the alveoli. The pO 2 in the alveoli cannot be measured directly but can be estimated using the alveolar gas equation: P A O 2 = P i O 2 -P a CO 2 /R where P A O 2 = pO 2 in alveoli P i O 2 = pO 2 of humidified inspired air P a CO 2 = pCO 2 in arterial blood R = respiratory quotient, approximately 0.8 Alveoli to Blood: Movement of oxygen from the alveoli to the blood is by simple diffusion. This occurs rapidly because, in the human lung, there are about 300 million alveoli closely associated with tiny blood vessels, resulting in very small diffusion distances. In the normal lung, the pO 2 drops from 100 mmHg in the alveoli to 95 mmHg in the arterial blood. This is the \"A-a gradient\" and may be massively increased in lung disease. There are a number of reasons for this gradient, including shunt (mixing of venous deoxygenated blood), mismatching of alveolar ventilation and blood flow, and diffusion problems. An example of abnormal shunt that can occur in a ventilated general anaesthesia patient results from atelectasis or closure of small airways. Inspired oxygen is unable to reach the collapsed alveoli and therefore the blood next to these alveoli remains deoxygenated, resulting in an overall lowering of arterial pO 2 . During ventilation, atelectasis can be prevented or treated by the use of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Consultant Anaesthetist Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand"}, {"text": "The delivery of oxygen to the tissues depends on adequate blood flow and adequate oxygen content in the blood. Most oxygen is bound to haemoglobin. Each haemoglobin molecule reversibly binds four oxygen molecules and the amount of binding can be quantified by measuring oxygen saturation. Continuous monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry has contributed hugely to improving anaesthetic safety during the last twenty years. The pO 2 can also be measured in the laboratory using a blood gas machine (Clark or oxygen electrode). The transfer of oxygen from the blood to the cells is analagous to the situation in the lungs. Diffusion is rapid because of very small distances and there is rapid equilibration between capillary blood and the interstitial fluid surrounding the cells. The pO 2 at this point is approximately 40 mmHg. Oxygen then diffuses intracellularly to the mitochondria (pO 2 5-20 mmHg), the \"power stations\" of the cell where oxgyen is used to make the energy-rich molecules that keep us alive.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Blood to Cells:"}, {"text": "Trevor Ackerly, Janet Droege, Craig Lancaster, and Kathleen Roxby William Buckland Radiotherapy Centre, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia Introduction: The William Buckland Radiotherapy Centre (WBRC) at the Alfred Hospital recently installed the BrainLab ExacTrac Frameless stereotactic system, an integrated treatment system which extends from imaging, through planning to treatment. The additional components in the treatment room comprise an infra-red detection system, blue-tooth connection, video camera, a pair of fixed oblique in-floor mounted kilovoltage X-ray tubes, matching roof mounted detectors, and a tiltable patient support, termed the robotic couch. The imaging process involves a mask based fixation and registration system at the CT scanner. The iPlan treatment planning system automatically recognizes the registration and uses it to relate the isocentre position to the CT data when exported to the ExacTrac computer on the treatment unit. At the treatment unit, ExacTrac provides four independent, and successively more accurate, corrections or checks of the isocentre position. Firstly, the patient is prepositioned to the isocentre by an infrared positioning sensing system. Secondly, this initial positioning is checked with a target positioning array against the lasers. Thirdly, automatic planar image fusion between in-room kilovoltage images and CT-derived DRRs gives a 6D correction. A manual review of the planar image fusion provides the final confirmation before treatment. Methods: A rando phantom was CT-scanned with the Head and Neck Localizer and Target Positioner in place. The images were imported into iPlan and an isocentre was added. The CT images and isocentre were then exported from iPlan to ExacTrac. The phantom was then positioned for treatment with the use of the ExacTrac system, including kilovoltage imaging and 6D correction and verification. Demonstrating the clinical practice being modeled, Figure 1 shows the ExacTrac in-room user interface at the point where patient prepositioning has been achieved and the user is asked to activate the kV image correction process. Figure 2 shows a patient DRR used in fusion with a patient kV image, an example of which is given in Figure 3 . After correction, the position of the isocentre was determined using a modified Winston-Lutz test. An electronic level was used to test the accuracy of the couch tilt. Commencing with the conclusion of the first fractionated treatment, the summaries automatically recorded by ExacTrac detailing the 6D corrections for each fraction were reviewed. A PTW 77334 1 cm 3 ion chamber was used to measure the dose required to obtain a kilovoltage image. Results: On the basis of segmented phantom models of intracranial treatments, the accuracy of isocentre positioning relative to bony anatomy for intra cranial treatments was determined to be 0.7 mm (with 1.25 mm CT slices). The tilt of the couch was found to be within the specified accuracy of 0.2 degrees. The first treatment summary review showed an average correction angle of 0.3q, with a maximum correction of 1.0q. The dose to the patient surface from a single exposure was of the order of 0.1 mGy for the standard verification exposure at 80 kV 100 mA 100 ms. Discussion: The minimum slice thickness the CT is capable of is 0.625 mm, but it was found that this did not improve the accuracy of isocentre positioning. Although the pitch angle of the couch was found to be within tolerance, for intra cranial treatments the robotic couch pivot point is about 170 cm from the isocentre. An average pitch angle correction of 0.3q corresponds to a height change of 9 mm at isocentre, 1q corresponds to 3 cm. The 0.2 degree tolerance for the robotic couch pitch angle does not amount to a 6 mm tolerance in the positioning of the isocentre because the infrared positioning system is used to drive the isocentre to the correct height after the robotic couch has pitched. The tilt mechanism can in this sense be thought of as a requirement to implement 2D fusion, rather than an objective.

Introduction: Treatment of lesions in the lung with radiotherapy requires particular treatment margins to account for breathing induced tumour motion. These margins may be reduced if real-time tumour tracking methods are applied, i.e. if the tumour position was known at all times during treatment the relative position between the tumour and the beam could be adjusted. Tracking can potentially be done in two different ways: either the aperture of the beam is continuously adjusted to the current tumour position by means of dynamic motion of individual leaves of the multileaf collimator or the patient is shifted continuously relative to the stationary radiation beam. With our adaptive tumour tracking system (ATTS), which we are in the process of developing, we pursue the second approach. The ATTS is designed to detect and track the tumour in real-time. In this work we concentrate on the tracking part only, which aims to adjust the patient position during irradiation. Patient position correction is achieved by means of adjusting the position of the treatment table during irradiation. Therefore the behavior of the robotic HexaPOD table (Medical Intelligence, Schwabm\u00fcnchen, Germany) was investigated in terms of its dynamic capabilities but also limitations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "A 4D phantom capable of simulating tumour trajectories was developed consisting of an industrial 6-axis robot (MELFA Industrial Robot, RV-1A Series, Mitsubishi Electric, Ratingen, Germany) to which an arm containing a tumour surrogate was attached (see Figure 1 ).

Introduction: Radiotherapy of the intact breast often requires the use of beam modifiers to achieve a homogeneous dose distribution within the breast tissue. More recently beam modulation techniques including forward planned segments and intensity modulated radiotherapy have been used to achieve a uniform dose distribution. The proximity of the breasts to the chest wall subjects them to respiratory induced motion. In this study respiratory motion was modelled (in 1-D) in a solid water phantom and the dose distribution for various sized multileaf collimator (MLC) apertures measured. The effect of respiratory motion on the dose distribution for a breast radiotherapy patient was determined by performing a 4DCT radiation therapy treatment planning (RTP) study. Several breast radiotherapy techniques were assessed for their sensitivity to patient respiration. Methods: An Anzai motion phantom was coupled to a cuboid solid water phantom, the direction of motion was perpendicular to beam incidence. Dose profiles were measured with radiographic film positioned at d max. in the phantom. Dose profiles were measured for 1, 2, 10 cm wide apertures with the phantom under motion conditions of static, sinusoidal, and a more complex respiratory type waveform involving a power cosine motion. A convolution kernel was created to model the effect of motion and verified against the measured data. A range of motion amplitudes and the effect of random setup errors were simulated. A radiotherapy treatment planning study was also performed using both 3DCT and 4DCT patient data. On the 3DCT data motion was mimicked by introducing isocentre shifts and assigning each isocentre a separate beam set, the beam weights were set according to a probability density function that described the motion. A 4DCT planning study was performed with patient motion inherently accounted for within the data set. The patient respiratory trace taken at the time of CT acquisition was modelled and a probability density function extracted, the dose from each phase of the breathing cycle was weighted according to this function and then summed to provide the total dose accumulated over the entire breathing cycle. Standard tangents, forward planned multi-segment treatment, inverse IMRT, and a non-coplanar technique were analysed. Plans were compared using dose difference maps and dose-volume histogram analysis. Results: Motion with amplitudes typical of patient respiration were found to have a large effect on the dose distributions measured in the phantom, as shown in Figure 1 . \"Static\" and \"Anzai Motion\" are measured distributions, \"Patient Trace\" and \"2cm Motion\" are convoluted static dose profiles derived from a patient motion trace. Amplitudes of motion that were comparable or larger than the aperture width produced the largest dose variation compared to the static dose distribution. The modelling of random setup errors in the presence of respiratory motion also revealed considerable perturbation of the dose distribution. In the planning study dose variation resulting from respiratory motion was concentrated in regions of high dose gradients. This can be seen in Figure 2 where the same plan was generated on the 50% exhale phase reconstruction, being representative of a 3DCT data set, and on the multi-phase 4DCT data set.

Results: No significant differences in CT number were found between the standard 3D scan and the 4DCT (individual phase data sets, untagged scan).

Two of the most important assumptions generally made are: i) that the variance of the random component of the patient inter-fraction motion is the same for each patient (i.e. that the variance of the treatment error is the same for all patients); and ii) that the treatment regimen can be regarded as consisting of an infinite number of infinitely small treatment fractions. Analysis of historically collected treatment position data for prostate radiotherapy shows that the first assumption does not hold -i.e. some patients move about more than others on the treatment couch. With regard to the second assumption, simulation studies show that a conventional hyper-fractionated course of treatment, consisting of roughly 30 treatment fractions per patient, gives rise to treatment dosimetry that is significantly different from the dosimetry of a hypothetical treatment regimen consisting of a far larger number of extremely small treatment fractions. This work develops a margin recipe that takes into consideration the empirically observed breaches of these two key assumptions. Methods: We regard the standard deviation of the patient position across fractions to be a random variable at the patient level, rather than being constant across patients. Analysis of inter-fraction motion data from a dataset of around 100 patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer shows that this random variable can be fit well by a gamma distribution. Sensible values for the mean and variance of this gamma distribution for a typical clinical scenario are estimated from the same dataset using the method of moments. Given this information, large scale Monte-Carlo simulations of mock patient treatments are performed for patient sets in which the mean and variance of each patient's treatment error standard deviation are selected from a range of values that span the empirical values for these parameters estimated from the prostate data.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References:"}, {"text": "Treatments are simulated for many patients (thousands), and a margin is calculated for each patient using Marcel van Herk's classic margin recipe with parameter values set such that each patient has a 90% probability of receiving 95% isodose to the entire target volume. The proportion of patients that actually receive 95% of dose to the entire target volume in simulation using this margin is recorded. The simulation process is repeated with the van Herk calculated margin multiplied by a margin adjustment factor (maf), which is allowed to range in value from 0.7 to 1.6. The result is a dataset in which each observation represents a simulated treatment outcome, and contains the mean and variance of the gamma distribution from which the standard deviation of the treatment error was drawn for this patient, the maf applied to the classic analytic margin, and an indicator variable specifying whether the patient did indeed receive 95% of the prescribed isodose to the entire tumour volume (in simulation) or not. This dataset is used to develop a logistic regression model for the probability of receiving 95% of prescribed dose as a function of the gamma distribution parameters and the maf. This model is used to determine the maf required to satisfy tumour volume dosimetry constraints over a range of parameter values of the gamma distribution that describe the patient mean inter-fraction motion. Results: When applying a margin recipe which assumes a treatment regimen consisting of an infinite number of infinitely small treatment fractions to a conventional hyper-fractionated regimen consisting of 30 fractions, the computed margin needs to be increased by roughly 20% for realistic patient data (maf \u00a7 1.2). When typical inter-patient variation in mean treatment error is also allowed for, the required margin increases by roughly a further 20% (total maf \u00a7 1.4). Discussion: When applying a margin recipe in clinical practice, care must be taken to ensure that the assumptions under which the margin recipe was developed adequately describe the clinical situation in which the margin recipe is to be applied. If this is not the case, then appropriate adjustment must be made to the margin. Conclusions: Various real world breaches of standard margin recipe assumptions render margin adjustment necessary. Introduction: Head and neck cancers, specifically squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), often present with regions of hypoxia (low oxygenation). Hypoxia affects the ability of radiation to damage DNA and has been proven to increase cellular radioresistance and decrease tumour local control after radiotherapy (RT). Methods: A Monte Carlo computer model is in development, which aims to simulate individual tumour cell propagation using epithelial cell data including: cell cycle time, stem cell and differentiated cell percentages, and cellular oxygenation. Currently, tumour oxygenation parameters have been taken from Eppendorf probe results from the literature, in terms of partial oxygen pressure at individual points in head and neck tumours. A RT module is also in development, which will simulate fractionated treatment according to any desired schedule, as well as the effects of reoxygenation and accelerated repopulation. Results: Modelling results will be presented in terms of the effect of hypoxia on tumour growth rate, as well as the investigation of the effects of very low oxygenation levels on cell kinetics and corresponding tumour growth. RT simulation results currently show that there is up to a 37 % difference in dose required for local tumour control if varying the levels of hypoxia, accelerated repopulation and reoxygenation within an expected range (see figure 1 for plans to experimentally analyse the oxygenation distribution for a human equivalent radiotherapy schedule (using the Oxylite 2000 measurement system by Oxford Optronix Ltd) in FaDu tumour xenografts in immuno-deficient mice will be discussed. Introduction: Spectroscopic x-ray detectors, such as Medipix, are opening the door to the widespread use of energy selective biomedical x-ray imaging. With dual energy computed tomography quickly becoming the clinical standard, spectroscopic imaging is a likely next step. However to confirm the utility of spectroscopic x-ray detectors there needs to be a clearer indication of the clinical benefits of the technology. Methods: In order to identify possible applications of spectroscopic imaging we conducted a brief literature review of clinical applications of dual energy systems. In addition we analysed simulation results from our own group, our collaborating partners, and industry. This information was coupled with information regarding the clinical significance of diseases and radiology work practices. Results: Broadly, we grouped the benefits of spectroscopic x-ray imaging into three areas; 1) Improved image quality, in particular reduction in beam hardening artefact.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3702, "end": 3714, "text": "figure 1 for", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "References:"}, {"text": "2) k-edge imaging, the identification of high Z-number contrast agents based on their k-edge.

The diagnosis of several diseases, such as breast cancer, are known to be improved by dual energy systems. In addition, there is improved soft tissue contrast of normal structures.

The detector provides new, exploitable information beyond the high temporal and spatial resolution of conventional x-ray equipment. 3-D x-ray reconstructions (computed tomography or CT) have revolutionized medical imaging. At present diffraction, interference, and energy information of the incident x-ray photons is largely untapped, leaving much opportunity for advancement. Spectroscopic x-ray information is likely to be the next technological advance in medical imaging, beyond current dual-energy CT. Numerous benefits arise from the advent of spectral CT; namely, a reduction in beam hardening artefacts, increased intrinsic tissue contrast, and a reduction in dose for contrast based protocols. Methods: Medipix2 is a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor with single photon counting capabilities. An extensive calibration process was undertaken to correct for inhomogeneities in the pixel cells due to variations in the electronics layer; the resulting threshold distribution yields a flat field response across the pixel array. Further calibrations including beam hardening corrections, the derivation of a photon energy scale, and charge sharing corrections were implemented to optimize the chip for image acquisition. Single threshold images, energy window images, and dual-energy subtraction images were acquired of the tip of a chicken wing and the left hand of a 20-week-old miscarried fetus. Matlab provided the platform for dual energy digital subtraction of the images. Results: The resulting dual-energy subtracted images display the first spectral images of biological tissue using Medipix2. Both projection and dual-energy subtracted images demonstrate clinical quality (good spatial resolution, high contrast, and low noise) over the 14 x 14mm 2 field of view. Figure 1 shows a projection image of the tip of a chicken wing. Conclusions: This study achieved two principle objectives: Medipix2 extracted energy information from the x-ray beam, facilitating spectral images through dual-energy digital subtraction. The detector also produced clinical quality radiological images. The methods used and images produced form the foundation of spectroscopic x-ray imaging by demonstrating energy selectivity. We believe that spectral CT is an exciting, useful, and feasible direction in which to progress with Medipix. Our group has designed and built a small, spectroscopic CT scanner (MARS) to further explore the powerful capabilities of Medipix2, as well as the forthcoming Medipix3. The scanner will not only record spatial and temporal information, but will also have the added feature of energy information and the benefits associated with spectral imaging. 14mm implants will further advance the field. Instrumented implants will be come intelligent implants. With the advance in electronics and nanotechnology, the goals of orthopaedic implants will be pushed even further. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a rehabilitative technology that uses electrical currents applied to the peripheral nerves. The purpose of FES is to provoke contraction of muscles deprived of nervous control, in order to obtain a useful functional movement. This distinguishes FES from purely therapeutic electrical stimulation, which is used predominantly to improve muscle strength, and wound healing, and to reduce pain, spasticity, and joint contractures. The prerequisite for FES is preserved excitability in the lower motoneuron and muscle that is able to contract. At the beginning (in 1970), FES was planned mainly as an orthotic device fro stroke patients, but in later years therapeutic use become more important in comparison to orthotic use. The paper investigates the objective evidence of benefits derived from surface functional electrical stimulation (FES)assisted gait for people after complete and incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), stroke, and cerebral palsy.

Introduction: Multi-modality imaging of the breast is becoming incresasingly common, and yet combining the information from the different images is difficult due to differences in the basic imaging physics, geometry, and loading conditions under which the breast is imaged. A key step in moving between these images will be the establishment of an individual-specific biomechanical model of the breast that provides the mapping between the different imaging configurations of the breast. We are creating such biomechanical models and are developing a software platform to incorporate the models into the clinical workflow for breast cancer diagnosis. This paper presents a study specific to predicting breast configurations during MR imaging and ultrasound where gravity loading significantly changes breast shape; for instance, the breast shape changes from when a patient lies prone (on her stomach) for an MR scan to when the patient lies supine (on her back) for an ultrasound. Methods: MR images of the breasts of a volunteer in prone and supine gravity-loaded configurations were acquired using a 1.5T MR scanner. The prone images were used to create a biomechanical model of the Volunteer's breast. The geometry was modeled using hexahedral volume elements with cubic-Hermite shape functions that provide smooth, realistic representations of breast shape. The breast was assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous and its mechanical behavior was modeled using a neo-Hookean stress-strain relationship (W = c 1 (I 1 -3)), where I 1 is a measure of strain (1 st prinicipal strain invariant) and c 1 is a measure of breast tissue stiffness that must be determined for each individual. Using a material parameter estimation technique, we identified c 1 for this individual as 0.08 kPa. A finite element implementation of large deformation elasticity was used to predict breast shape in the supine gravity-loaded configuration. The breast was assumed to be fixed to the chest wall and gravity loading was applied as a body force. The predicted shape was compared to the MR images of the supine configuration by projecting segmented data of the skin surface from the supine images onto the predicted breast surface configuration.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Results: The biomechanical model predicted breast shape in the supine configuration with an RMS error of 8.4 mm.

The purpose of lung function testing is to determine the efficiency of gas exchange, and identify any impairment in this process by disease or injury. There are many different tests of lung function that either measure singularly, or complementary components of the gas exchange process.

The basis for the reduction of integral dose is the proton's Bragg peak which increases the dose deposited in the tumour while reduces that to the normal tissue at the distal side of the target volume. Protons also have a demonstrated advantage for treating small tumour volumes at shallow depths such as tumours of the eye and of the CNS such as chordomas and chondrosarcomas. Proton radiotherapy reduces the volume of normal tissue exposed to low doses, which is clinically significant with respect to the risk of second malignancies. That risk is notably more pronounced for younger patients than older ones as younger patients are more at risk to future radiation induced cancers. However, proton therapy is less tolerant than photon therapy to uncertainties in both treatment planning and treatment delivery. For example, tissue inhomogeneity has a greater effect on proton dose distributions than on photon dose distributions. In planning proton therapy, the density of tissue along the proton path must be precisely determined and accounted for in order to obtain the required proton energy distribution to achieve the planned dose distribution in the patient. Failure to allow for a zone of higher density could result in a near zero dose in a distal segment of the target volume due to the reduced range of the protons. In contrast, for photons, because of their different energy loss processes, an increased density would cause only a modest lowering of the dose distal to the higher density region. Conversely, neglecting to account for an air cavity upstream of the target volume would, for proton beams; result in a high dose being deposited in distal normal structures while only a modestly increased dose would be deposited in the case of photon beams. Furthermore, motion and mis-registration of the target volume with the radiation beams have far more severe consequences in proton therapy compared to photon therapy. If the target volumes are to be adequately irradiated, and adjacent OARs are to be protected in proton therapy, it is essential: that the causes and possible magnitudes of motion and mis-registration are understood; that their possible consequences are understood; that measures are taken to minimize motion and misregistration to the extent possible and clinically warranted. It is almost impossible to get rid of all uncertainties in radiation therapy. Therefore, it is important to understand the sources of these uncertainties quantify their magnitude and develop mitigation and/or minimization strategies. In proton therapy these uncertainties arise from several sources that include; dose calculation approximations, biological considerations, setup and anatomical variations, and internal movements of low and high density organs into the beam path. Organ motion also has a major impact on the proton range, which is managed by adding a distal safety margin. These margins reduce the benefit of proton therapy in treatment sites where the physical properties of protons could make a significant difference, such as lung cancer. The focus of this presentation is to; a) understand the potential sources of dosimetric uncertainties in proton therapy b) evaluate the impact of these uncertainties on the accuracy and conformity of dose delivered to patients and c) suggest potential strategies that translate physical advantage of proton therapy into a maximized dosimetric benefit in the patient.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"}, {"text": "Introduction: Proton therapy is an important innovation in external beam radiation therapy. Through the benefits of the Bragg peak a highly conformal dose may be delivered across a tumour volume. Such a dose-distribution can minimise the occurrence of normal tissue complications whilst maximising effective tumour control. For quality assurance (QA) purposes it is important to be able to accurately characterise a proton therapy beam. A measure of the absorbed dose along the beam does not provide sufficient biological information. An alternate method of characterisation is the microdosimetry approach. The microdosimetry approach infers the radiobiological properties of the beam by measuring the energy deposited by the beam in a micron sized volume. This allows the changing radiobiological effectiveness (RBE) of the beam along the Bragg peak to be considered. Traditionally gas proportional counters have been used as the detector of choice in microdosimetry. These detectors have the advantage of excellent tissue equivalency of the gas but also suffer from some well documented short comings. In particular, they are unsuitable for proton therapy QA purposes as the large physical size of the sensitive volume (SV) limits the spatial resolution achievable in measurements. Silicon detectors possess a truly microscopic SV volume and thus exhibit a far superior spatial resolution. They also address several of the other problems associated with gas detectors. Recently a silicon detector with a planar SV has been developed at the University of Wollongong's Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP). This device has been successfully tested and used to obtain biological data at various proton therapy institutes including: Loma Linda University Medical Centre (LLUMC), California, and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston. Novel in-field and out-of field measurements have been performed. These have led to a clearer understanding of a proton beam's RBE at various points within a patient. Studies have identified that the performance of the device may be improved upon by modifying the geometry of the SV from planar to cylindrical. Through the CMRP's collaboration with the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) such a cylindrical device has been fabricated and is currently being tested. Methods: The charge collection characteristics of the new cylindrical silicon detector structure were experimentally determined via an ion beam induced charge (IBIC) study. This was performed using the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) heavy ion microprobe. The amount of energy deposited within the microdosimeter for each ion traversal, \u01fbE, was measured with a standard charge sensitive preamplifier, shaping amplifier and MCA in coincidence with digitized voltage signals of the beam position, x and y for each event in \u01fbE. Data triplets (x,y,\u01fbE) were saved for each event in a list mode file. Analysis software used these files to generate IBIC imaging maps displaying either; a spatially resolved image of the median amount of charge collected, or the spatially resolved frequency of events contained within a particular range of deposited energies of interest, as a function of beam position. Results: Results reveal that the new detector structures posses a well defined cylindrical SV, see fig. 1 . An array of these structures successfully provides a greater effective surface area without any degradation of the measured spectrum. Discussion: Given that the second generation detector structures possess a well defined cylindrical SV, they have the potential to improve upon the performance of the previous silicon microdosimeter design. Conclusions: Silicon microdosimeters have the potential to play an important role in proton therapy QA. The CMRP has successfully tested a silicon microdosimeter at various international proton therapy institutes. Recently a second generation silicon microdosimeter has been developed. Charge collection imaging reveals the new device possesses a well defined cylindrical SV, as required for an improved performance. Introduction: Proton computed tomography (pCT) is a novel imaging modality that has been suggested as a means for maximizing the potential benefits of proton radiation therapy. Currently, proton therapy treatment plans are carried out based on data acquired from X-ray CT scans. However, there is a well documented uncertainty in converting CT numbers to electron densities, which are the values required by the treatment planning software to predict how the dose will be deposited within the patient. Proton CT employs proton-by-proton energy loss measurements to directly obtain a 3D map of relative electron densities, minimizing the uncertainty of Bragg peak location at treatment time. In order to achieve desired spatial resolution in the reconstructed image, reconstruction algorithms must employ a path approximation formalism that takes into account multiple Coulomb scattering of the protons within the patient. Therefore, algorithms that can handle non-linear paths are required. Algebraic techniques that involve cyclic processing of many linear equations are one such example. Although these algorithms result in images of superior quality to those reconstructed with transform methods, such as filtered backprojection, far more computing time is required. Therefore, a time efficient method of reconstructing the pCT projection data must be developed. This presentation outlines the process of image formation in pCT; from measurement, to path calculation, to specific image reconstruction algorithms aimed at reducing the time required to reconstruct pCT images. Methods: The Monte Carlo simulation toolkit GEANT4 is used to simulate a prototype pCT system. Using this data, images are reconstructed using various algebraic image reconstruction algorithms on a quad core machine. Calculating the relative error between the reconstructed images and the known phantom composition allows for a comparison of image quality. The amount of time saved by employing block iterative (BI) reconstruction algorithms (SART, BICAV and DROP) as opposed to a fully sequential algorithm (ART) is also demonstrated. Results: Figure 1 illustrates relative error for each algorithm as a function of cycle number. Discussion: When the data is divided into one projection angle per block (180 blocks), all the BI algorithms investigated were found to demonstrate faster convergence than the fully sequential ART. On the quad core machine used in this study, the use of block iterative algorithms was found to speed up the reconstruction process by a factor of 3. Further acceleration is possible with a greater number of processors, or with graphical processing units. Conclusions: Although image reconstruction in pCT may be a time consuming task on a single processing unit, BI image reconstruction algorithms allow the workload to be divided over multiple processors, thus reducing the time required to reconstruct images. The results from this study indicate that of the BI algorithms tested, DROP provides the best quality images when applied to pCT projection data.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3411, "end": 3417, "text": "fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 6301, "end": 6309, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"}, {"text": "Introduction: Following the implementation of a quality system, the ARPANSA radiotherapy calibration service was accredited to ISO 17025 1 by the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) in 2007.

This Level III dosimetry audit is intended to test the full treatment chain, including treatment planning, thereby providing verification of the overall accuracy of delivery of prescribed radiotherapy doses. The NRL, acting as New Zealand's regulatory authority, will utilise the method developed to conduct biennial audits at all radiotherapy centers. Methods: A CIRS anthropomorphic chest phantom (see Figure 1 ) and a MOSFET dosimetry system were purchased for the project. The MOSFET's reproducibility, energy dependence and angular dependence were assessed. Following the commissioning of the MOSFETS the dosimetry system was trialed at Christchurch Hospital's radiation oncology department. Measurements were carried out in the phantom to test the MOSFET's response in both lung and soft tissue. With clinical input a simple treatment plan and a more complex plan (involving lung tissue and wedges) were devised. These plans were designed to test the entire treatment planning and dose delivery process. An audit protocol was written and tested at two radiotherapy centres. Results: Commissioning measurements for the MOSFETs revealed that the calibration factors were energy dependent, and each MOSFET required individual calibration. Reproducibility was found to have an average standard deviation of 2% on standard sensitivity and 1.2% on high sensitivity in the dose range of 1 -2 Gy. When operated at 90 degrees to the beam axis a drop in response of 6% for 60 Co and 3% for 6 MV photons was observed with regards to 0 degrees. This indicates that angular dependence of the MOSFET was also a function of energy. Based on this commissioning work, an uncertainty of \u00b13.4 % at the 95 % level of confidence has been estimated for measurements of dose in the region of 2 Gy. The results for the initial treatment protocol trials produced agreement between the planned doses, and the measured doses to within the calculated uncertainties for 2 of the 4 treatments delivered Discussion: The performance of the MOSFETs was found to be not entirely consistent with the manufacturer's claims, and careful characterisation of the MOSFETs was required in order to determine accurate doses from their raw readings. Despite such characterization, there was disagreement between the calculated doses and measured doses in 2 of the 4 trials. Teething problems were encountered in the audit protocol which may partially account for this, as well as the fact that the MOSFETs used in this trial were relatively old, and their performance was probably not optimal. Lessons learned from these trials have been incorporated in an updated treatment protocol, and for future work new MOSFETs will be purchased to improve the system performance.

Introduction: Image guided brachytherapy offers the ability to accurately deliver high doses of radiation in a small number of treatment fractions. However, with the rapid fall off in dose, small geometric uncertainties in source position can lead to significant errors in dose delivery. Furthermore, in the absence of a record and verification system and often the pressure to plan and treat the patient in a very short period of time, the potential for error is large. International studies 1,2 have demonstrated that an audit process can identify geometric and dosimetric errors that may significantly impact on clinical outcomes. Despite these risks and international evidence, a brachytherapy audit has not been conducted in Australasia. To address this issue, local hospital, university and industry funding was sourced to run a pilot study with the intention of designing a Level III (anthropomorphic) dosimetry audit that will be open to all Australian brachytherapy sites. In this paper we describe the design of the pilot study, the challenges that we have encountered, the results from TLD measurements and centre survey. Methods: Seven sites from 4 states were invited to participate in the pilot study. The cylindrical phantom, which is similar in design to that used by the ESTRO group 2 , was filled with water and imaged using the centre's standard imaging protocol for a multi-catheter implant (ie orthogonal radiographs or CT). A treatment plan was generated to deliver 1Gy to the central (1 of 3) TLD from 6 dwell positions. The phantom provides three channels that contained the catheters provided by the local facility. Each catheter was used to deliver the dose to the TLDs. The TLDs were calibrated using an in-air calibration jig. The calibration factor for the ion chamber used to determine the air kerma rate of the source (used to calibrate the TLDs) was derived from the National Physical Laboratory (UK) primary standard and an interpolated value from the Australian laboratory (ARPANSA).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "The purpose of the pilot study was to verify the feasibility of a brachytherapy audit, define the methodology and quantitate the uncertainties in the measurement process.

All TLD results from the phantom measurements were within 5% of one another with the exception of one subset of TLD readings where an error in programming the dwell positions was detected. TLDs provide a convenient method of measuring dose and their small size is appropriate in a high dose gradient, though initial calibration of the TLDs revealed a systematic 8% difference between TLDs irradiated in the air-jig and the water phantom and tests are currently underway to confirm a TLD energy response as a cause for the discrepancy. Most centres use a well chamber to determine or verify the air kerma rate of their Ir-192 source and small differences in calibration standards add to the uncertainties in the TLD readings.

A difference of 2mm can lead to field nonuniformity of up to 35% along the junction. Field junction QA should therefore be carried out when junctions are used regularly to ensure that there is no overdose or underdose along the junction. Junction QA is often performed qualitatively as quantitative QA often requires the use of film dosimetry which is time consuming and requires specific software. The technique introduced uses a regular QA device which is already set up as part of fortnightly QA. Results are quickly achieved and can be compared quantitatively in a period of minutes without the time consuming use of film dosimetry. Methods: A commercially available 1D diode array (Sun Nuclear Profiler) was evaluated as a QA tool for determining the jaw mismatch along a junction. By comparing the diodes on either side of the central axis (CAX) the relationship between junction mismatch and diode reading was evaluated. Even though the diodes are placed 2.5 mm on either side of the CAX reasonable results of the junction mismatch can be achieved by this method as penumbral influences are pronounced at a distance of the width of the penumbra, and become more apparent with mismatch. The resulting relationship between nonuniformity is therefore expected to be approximately linear for small shifts becoming non-linear for large shifts. By using the diodes on either side of the CAX an accurate measurement of jaw offset can be calculated. This concept can be extended to IMRT film QA, where the jaw calibration is checked by moving the junction through the IMRT range of fields for the MLC leaves, combined with a visual film check.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Department of Medical Physics, Adelaide Radiotherapy Centre, Adelaide, Australia"}, {"text": "Results: There is a linear relationship between the average value of the diodes next to the CAX and the offset in leaf position (mm).

Introduction: Medipix is a hybrid x-ray detector designed to provide energy selective images at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This spectroscopic capability gives control over the received x-ray spectrum to be analysed and additional information on material composition through variations in mass attenuation. A brief feasibility study was undertaken, which used plain radiography to successfully demonstrate the practical application of this technology to biomedical imaging. The subtle variations in absorption that Medipix can detect are most useful if overlying tissues do not dilute the effect; it was therefore decided to construct a CT scanner to further demonstrate the clinical utility of the detector. Methods: A desktop CT scanner was designed that would enable us to image small (up to 80mm diameter and 200mm length) animals and biological samples to demonstrate the novel spectral information that Medipix can deliver. The scanner was designed to take full advantage of the high spatial resolution that Medipix offers (55\u03bcm pixels) and to access the most energy information possible within the limits set by detector material and low energy charge-sharing effects.

Introduction: Near-infrared diffuse optical tomography (NIR-DOT) has been developing and evolving continuously over the past 15 years. It is a promising tool to probe highly scattering media such as biological tissue to recover and localize variations in optical properties from which functional parameters can be extracted. We study the development and performance of a DOT system using a single light probe and multiple detectors. The light transport through a tissue is diffusive in nature and can be modeled using diffusion equation under certain constraints. The experiments are carried out by inserting single and multiple inhomogeneities of size 6 mm of high optical absorption coefficient in an otherwise homogeneous phantom, while keeping the scattering coefficient same. Diffusion equation for photon transport is solved using Finite Element Method (FEM) and Jacobian is modeled for reconstructing the optical parameters. The inverse problem is solved using Model Based Iterative Image Reconstruction (MoBIIR). The simulation result with a single light probe shows that the system is capable of resolving inhomogeneities of size 6 mm, when the absorption coefficient of the inhomogeneity is three times that of the background tissue. To validate this result, a prototype model for performing this experiment is developed. The high frequency (100 MHz) sinusoidal is used for modulating a laser beam and is propagated through the tissue.The amplitude and phase changes are found to be disturbed by the presence of the inhomogeneity in the object. The experimental data (amplitude and the phase measured at the detector) are used for reconstruction. The results show that a single source system is capable of detecting multiple inhomogeneities of sizes of 6mm in diameter. The localization error for a 6 mm inhomogeneity is found to be 2 mm.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Figure 1. a) Posterior view of the LV epicardial surface fitted to the segmented surface contours; b) Posterior view of the LV showing fitted fibre vectors; c) Posterior view of the individual errors between predicted and tracked material points coordinates;"}, {"text": "We discuss the development of single source system for detection of absorbing and scattering inhomogeneity using the principles of diffuse optical tomography.

Although very few data are available on pelvic floor morphology and anatomy, studies have shown possible links between muscle hypertrophy and long-term, highintensity training that involves activation of the pelvic floor muscles. It is postulated that these changes in morphology (including both muscle size and tone) may contribute to birth complications for athletes during the second stage of labour as the fetal head descends through the maternal pelvis. In this study, we will investigate the effect of muscle size on vaginal delivery using individual-specific pelvic floor models and an anatomically-based fetal skull model, by comparing the biomechanical response of the levator ani (LA) muscle of an athlete and a non-athlete.

Fig. 1 shows the pelvic floor model created from the non-athlete MR images. The fetal skull data was provided by Dr Rudy Lapeer from the University of East Anglia by laser scanning a skull replica produced by ESP Ltd. This data was extrapolated into 3D by introducing a constant bone thickness of 5 mm. To mimic the second stage of labour, the fetal head was passed through the LA over several displacement steps. Simulation started as the fetal head came into contact with iliococcygeus in an initial occiput anterior orientation. The path of the head was controlled by defining the spatial positions of several nodes on the head. The LA muscle was fixed at its attachment points to the pubis (anteriorly), ischial spines (laterally), and coccyx (posteriorly). The biomechanical interaction between the head and the passive muscle was modeled using finite deformation elasticity with contact mechanics. Results: Two important factors were evaluated from the simulation to measure the level of difficulty during vaginal delivery for each individual: the amount of force required to deliver the fetal head, and the maximum muscle stretch. We have found a more than 40% increase in peak force in the athlete model compared to the non-athlete, indicating the need for more effort for athletic mothers. The maximum principal stretch ratio exceeded 3 for both the athlete and the non-athlete. The amount of stretch was similar at similar positions of the two models. Discussion: Biomechanical modelling of the second stage of labour is challenging with very sparse data on the mechanical and morphological properties of the pelvic floor. We plan to further improve our modelling framework by introducing muscle fibers into LA.

(2005) reported that breast cancer is one of the most common causes of female cancer death in New Zealand. X-ray mammography is currently recognised as the gold standard for screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Since mammographic X-ray images are 2D projections of a 3D object, localisation of features identified within the breast volume is not trivial. Furthermore, mammograms represent highly deformed configurations of the breast due to compression, thus the tumour localisation process relies on the expertise of the clinicians. The primary objective of this research is to remove this subjectivity of tumour tracking and address the above limitations through the development of a physics-based biomechanical model of the breast that can realistically predict mammographic compressions, and thus reliably track visible tumours to an uncompressed configuration of the breast.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion:"}, {"text": "We have constructed a modelling framework using in-house software CMISS (http://www.cmiss.org) to numerically simulate the mammographic compression.

An experimental framework was set up using homogeneous, incompressible, and isotropic silicon gel phantoms undergoing two large compression modes, in order to validate the modelling framework. The compressed configurations of the gel phantom were imaged using a 1.5T MR scanner, from which the surface data and locations of four internal markers were segmented.

In order for clinicians to diagnose and manage breast cancer, various modalities such as mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sonography may be used to image the breasts. However, each imaging modality displays information about the breast tissues differently 1 . Researchers have found that a combination of all three modalities leads to more effective diagnosis and management of breast cancers 2 . In order to aid clinicians in interpreting the breast images from different modalities, we have developed a computational framework for generating individual-specific, 3D, finite element (FE) models of the breast 3, 4 . Medical images are embedded into this model, which can then be solved subject to finite elasticity mechanics to predict the deformation and warped view of the image 5 . In order to analyse the accuracy of the model predictions, normalised cross correlation (NCC) was used to compare the model-warped images with the clinical images of different gravity-loaded states. A biomechanical image registration tool of this kind will aid radiologists to provide more reliable diagnosis and localisation of breast cancer. Methods: An individual-specific FE model was created in order to model the large deformations that the breast undergoes due to gravity loading. A female volunteer was asked to lie in different positions to allow MR images of the breast to be obtained under different gravity-loading states. MR images were acquired using T2 weighting (TE=102, TR=6560). The image dimensions were 512x512 pixels with a 350x350 mm field of view and 2.5 mm slice thickness, with 52-60 slices through the supero-inferior direction. The prone MR images were segmented to isolate the breast tissues and a tricubic Hermite FE model was created from the geometric data.

A novel model of lung mechanics that estimates threshold opening pressure (TOP) and threshold closing pressure (TCP) of alveolar units captures the fundamental characteristics of acute lung injury and ARDS. Changes in the distributions of TOPs and TCPs can be used to inform the clinician about the level of de-recruitment and the impact of changes in therapy.

Similarly, understanding the patient condition and dynamics is a direct lead-in to diagnosis, particularly if used to diagnose levels of function, such as the percentage of ARDS affected lung. Patient agitation is a universal phenomenon in the critically ill. The result of suboptimal management is either dangerous agitation or over-sedation.

The gamma evaluation tool assesses differences in dose as well as differences in position. We assessed the performance of the electronic portal dosimetry system by delivering six IMRT plans that had passed our previous (film-based) quality assurance testing. In addition, we introduced deliberate dosimetric errors by varying the monitor units delivered; plus positional errors, by rotating the collimator. We treated the plans both at gantry zero and the clinical gantry angles, in order to find the most reliable, and realistic method of quality assurance. At each new gantry angle, the EPID was retracted and then brought back out into position.

The questionnaire was sent to eminent physicists in 20 countries in the Asia/Pacific region in early 2008. Results: Answers were received from 16 countries representing nearly 2500 medical physicists. There was general agreement that medical physicists should have both academic (typically at MSc level) and clinical (typically at least 2 years) training. ROMPs spent most of their time working in radiotherapy treatment planning (average 17 hours per week), however also radiation protection and engineering tasks were common. Typically, only physicists in large centers are involved in research and teaching. Most respondents thought that the workload of physicists was high with more than 500 patients per year per physicist, less than 1 ROMP per two oncologists as the norm and on average 1 megavoltage treatment unit per physicist. There was also a clear indication of increased complexity of technology in the region with many countries reporting to have installed helical tomotherapy, IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy), IGRT (Image Guided Radiation Therapy), gamma and cyber knife units. This and the continued workload from brachytherapy will require growing expertise and numbers in the medical physics workforce. Conclusion: As demand for cancer treatment and radiation oncology increases, there is an increasing need for qualified medical physicists. The increasing complexity of the treatment technology also requires a highly skilled workforce with significant continuing education needs. Addressing this will be an important challenge for the future. Acknowledgements: The State-of-the-art pixel semiconductor devices of Medipix type are becoming a very powerful instrument for position sensitive X-ray photon and particle spectroscopy. The semiconductor pixel detector of Timepix type (256x256 pixels 55 \u021dm wide) is a successor of the Medipix2 device. Each Timepix pixel can be operated in one of the three modes, i) counting of the particles, ii) measurement of the charge generated by interacting particles (Time Over Threshold (TOT) mode), iii) measurement of the time of interaction. Then, the device can count the amount of charge being deposited by a charged particle in each pixel due to charge diffusion and subsequent charge sharing within the particle cluster or track and these counts can be translated into energy with a proper calibration. This feature makes possible on-line 3D-visualization of particle tracks in solid state sensor. The charge sharing effect influencing the particle track generation has been investigated with Timepix pixel detectors with 300 \u021dm thick silicon sensor exposed to X-ray photons, protons, alpha-particles, and ions allowing one to measure sensitively the local Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE) at a 5 keV pixel threshold level. Cluster shapes and sizes measured as a function of the bias voltage for protons and heavier charged particles of various angular incidences on the Timepix devices are reported.

Quantifying the exhaust differential pressure was necessary to ascertain the 'ideal' differential pressure. The manufacturer's information was vague. Most hyperbaric units have set their differential pressures by 'trial & error' but we took a more scientific approach.

In the past year, public awareness of the radiation risks associated with x-ray imaging examinations has increased with several high profile articles appearing in the scientific literature (e.g., JAMA, New Engl J Med) as well as the popular press (e.g. NY Times). The magnitude of the per capita medical radiation dose, or temporal changes in this parameter, should not be a major concern to the medical imaging community per se. Key questions that do need to be addressed are: (1)) whether proposed examinations is indicated; and (2), are patient exposures as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) without sacrificing valuable diagnostic information. Since an indicated examination is one where the patient benefit is greater than any corresponding risk (detriment), it is vital that imaging practitioners understand the magnitude of the radiation risks associated with each type of diagnostic procedure. In this paper, we describe a method for estimating patient doses (and risks) in cardiac CT angiography where account is taken of: (a) patient size; (b) patient age; and (c) patient sex.

Data from 1458 diagnostic only CA procedures performed in 2006 was used for comparison. For each procedure type, FT, number of digital frames acquired and estimated effective dose (E) were compared. Strategies included the minimal use of high dose imaging modes, use of minimum frame rates, use of low radiographic density imaging projections and minimisation of detector entrance doses (to achieve clinically relevant image quality). Results: A summary of the data acquired in this study is shown in Table 1 . E has been derived from procedure dose area product using case specific conversion factors.

However, EP procedures generally are associated with lower E than for CA, the exception being procedures for atrial fibrillation (AF). Overall generalised descriptors of radiation use were found to be markedly influenced by case load spectrum. Conclusion: Through the application of a range of exposure minimisation strategies, the radiation risk to patients undergoing diagnostic and most therapeutic EP procedures (except AF ablations) can be reduced to be significantly less than that faced by patients undergoing CA.

It has become increasingly important, therefore, to be able to accurately asses the thickness of shielding required for walls, and whether it is really necessary to extend such shielding all the way to the ceiling. A series of Monte Carlo simulations of the dose deposited in a person positioned behind a shielding barrier were carried out using the EGSnrc code.

The dose from scatter over the barrier in scenario 5, at head level, was calculated to be 0.50 PGy/h per GBq in the patient phantom.

For a person positioned 30 cm behind a 2 cm thick by 210.0 cm high lead barrier, approximately 60% of the dose at head level is due to scatter coming over the wall, while at hip level, the dose is due to radiation transmitted through the wall. A simple geometric analysis shows that the personal dose due to scatter is greatest when the person is positioned approximately 130 cm from the barrier. In summary, PET shielding estimates based on parallel broad beam geometry appear to overestimate the transmission through lead shielding walls by a factor of about 2. The dose from scatter over the barrier at waist height is relatively small, but may have to be taken into account if the design dose limit is low.

For PET/CT and nuclear medicine shielding, a similar approach is usually employed [3] . Although the methodological approach may be similar, considerable variation is possible in the choice of design dose limits and occupancy factors. For uncontrolled areas, design dose limits of 1 mSv per annum, 0.3 mSv per annum and 0.25 mSv per annum are recommended in different reports. The rationale for the lower limits is that some account must be taken of possible exposure from other sources; although this is undeniably true, there appears to be no solid scientific basis for the limits chosen, and this has been the subject of some controversy [4] . In addition, the choice of occupancy factors for shielded areas is somewhat subjective and, as will be shown in this paper, the way in which they are generally used is somewhat flawed. Methods: Concurrent exposure from multiple sources of exposure (e.g. in a shared control room between two fluoroscopy imaging rooms) is relatively easy to handle; the designated design dose limit for the area can be simply divided by the number of concurrent exposures. Sequential exposures from multiple sources of exposure are more problematic and are poorly handled by current shielding methods. For example, an office, corridor, tea room and bathroom adjoining a CT Room would typically be allocated occupancy factors of 1, 0.2 , 0.2 and 0.05 respectively. The problem here is that the \"representative individual\" (as defined by the ICRP) is highly unlikely to be exposed in these areas in an \"exclusive OR\" fashion (e.g., .all of their day in the office OR 0.2 of their working day exposed in the corridor, OR 0.2 of their day in the tea room OR 0.05 of their working day in the bathroom). A far more likely scenario is that they may typically spend (say), 6 hours in their office AND 0.75 hours in the corridor AND 1 hour in the tea room (lunch and tea breaks) AND 0.25 hours in the bathroom (a total of 8 hours per day).

In particular it was felt that these types of devices provide the opportunity for additional rehabilitation activity to occur without impacting significantly on therapist time as patients can potentially undertake this exercise outside of conventional therapy or following discharge from existing rehabilitation services. Traditionally, access to post-inpatient rehabilitation services is very limited and so devices that have the potential to be used in the home environment were seen as advantageous. However, cost and ease of technical use were seen as major potential limiting factors. While common issues were often identified by engineers, clinicians and patients, each had their unique perspectives and priorities that need to be considered and rationalised as part of this process.

Transcutaneous Energy Transfer (TET) can provide continuous power to implanted devices without the risk of infection associated with a wire passing through the skin. It is implemented through a transcutaneous transformer where the primary and the secondary coils of a transformer are separated by the patient's skin providing two electrically isolated systems. The electromagnetic field produced by the primary coil penetrates the skin and produces an induced voltage in the secondary coil which is then used to power the biomedical device. Challenges for a TET system relate to the need to avoid heating effects and deal with variable coupling conditions between coils. Implementing resonant circuits, with a characteristic resonant frequency, is a valuable approach to dealing with loose coupling between the primary and secondary coils. In this paper, we present a closed loop frequency based power regulation method which varies the resonant frequency of the primary system to deliver the correct power to the load. Methods: Frequency control involves varying the operating frequency of the primary power converter to vary the power delivered to the load. Depending on the operating frequency of the primary power converter, the secondary pick-up coil is either tuned (maximum power transfer) or detuned (reduced power transfer); there by varying the effective power delivered to the implantable load. The operating frequency of the primary converter can be varied by varying the effective capacitance in the primary resonant tank. This was carried out by a dynamic switching capacitor control method. As illustrated in figure  1 , the closed loop control is implemented by placing two radio frequency (RF) transceivers into the system.

Impairments in the propagation of this gastric electrical activity (GEA) induce changes in normal gastric motility. These motility disturbances have been observed in various gastrointestinal pathologies such as gastroparesis, in which there is delayed gastric emptying. Alteration of GEA by external stimulation, referred to as gastric electrical stimulation (GES) has been proposed as a potential treatment for gastroparesis and obesity. We aimed to perform highdensity recordings from pigs in-vivo to improve knowledge of GEA propagation and the effects of GES. Methods: Platform: A 4x8 electrode platform was constructed by arranging 0.3 mm Teflon-coated silver wires at 5mm intervals in a PVC and epoxy-resin base plate. Electrodes were soldered to stainless steel connecting wires, which passed through the base plate to a sleeve constructed of copper shielding and silicone, and eventually to meet a SCSI cable connector. In-vivo mapping: Four weaner pigs weighing 30 -35kg underwent general anaesthesia followed by a midline laparotomy. The electrode assembly (Fig 1a) was positioned over the antral serosa (Fig 1b) with the aid of wet gauze.

Introduction: The Siemens ARTISTE linear accelerator is a new product which has a 160 leaf multileaf collimator (MLC). One of the main differences between the Siemens 160 MLC and earlier versions, such as the 58 and 82 MLC, is that the leaves move horizontally rather than divergently. This change in leaf movement has significantly increased leaf speed. Furthermore, the 160 MLC provides improved conformal shape for small irregular fields, and reduced IMRT treatment delivery time. However, because the 160 MLC is a new design there may be some questions and clinical concerns regarding its ability to improve treatment delivery with reliability. Therefore, before the 160 MLC can be used clinically, its characteristics must be verified and evaluated relative to a previous design. This process is known as commissioning and is a requirement for clinical use. The purpose of this project is to commission the 160 MLC, and thus report on its characteristics, which include leakage, penumbra, leaf positional and movement accuracy, leaf speed and collimator and gantry angle dependents. Methods: Leakage and penumbra measurements were performed using ion chambers and a water tank. Interleaf leakage was measured by scanning along the central axis, perpendicular to the direction of leaf motion. The Y jaw was fully open, while the X1 and X2 jaws were positioned at 19cm and 20cm respectively. The maximum leaf end leakage was measured by scanning along the central axis parallel to the direction of leaf motion, for a 0 x 40 cm 2 field size, with the leaves closed in the centre. Leaf end leakage with the Y jaws closed was also measured using the same method. These measurements were performed at D max and 100cm SSD for a 10 MV x-ray beam. The longitudinal penumbra of a 6 MV x-ray beam at 90cm SSD and depth 10 cm was measured for field sizes 5 x 5, 10 x 10, 20 x 20, 30 x 30 and 40 x 40 cm 2 . The profiles were obtained by scanning along the central axis parallel to direction of leaf motion. These measurements were verified using film. Leaf positional accuracy was measured by verifying the position of the MLC leaves using the light field and radiation field. Graph paper was used to verify the light field, and film was used to verify the radiation field. Leaf speed was evaluated by measuring the time taken for the leaves to travel from a 1 x 40 cm 2 field to a 40 x 40 cm 2 field, and from a 40 x 40 cm 2 field to a 1 x 40 cm 2 field. Collimator and gantry angle dependence was checked by measuring the position of different field shapes at different collimator and gantry angles. Results: The maximum leakage was 0.67% while the average leakage was 0.37%. The maximum leaf end leakage, measured with the Y Jaw open along the central axis was 12.17%, and the maximum leaf end leakage when the Y Jaw was closed was 0.69%. The average longitudinal penumbra for field sizes up to 10 x 10 cm 2 was 0.56 \u00b1 0.05 cm, while for field sizes greater than 10 x 10 cm 2 , the average longitudinal penumbra was 1.04 \u00b1 0.13 cm. The speed of the MLC leaves was -3.47 \u00b1 0.27 cm/s. MLC leaf position was within reasonable accuracy. Collimator and gantry angle dependence checks showed that when the collimator and gantry were rotated to different angles, there was no evidence of sag in the MLC due to gravity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "The measured leakage for the 160 MLC is considerably lower than the leakage measured for the Siemens 58 MLC; this is because the 160 MLC leaves do not use the conventional tongue and groove design, but uses a new tilted design, known as the triangular tongue and groove design. By tilting the leaves 0.37\u00b0 it appears that interleaf leakage is reduced. The leaves of the 160 MLC have a minimum closing gap of approximately 0.4 mm to avoid opposing leaves colliding; this contributes to the overall leaf end leakage. However, the reason for maximum leaf end leakage along the central axis is due to the rounded s-shaped design of the leaf ends. Penumbra width is defined as the distance between the 80% and 20% isodose lines. The average longitudinal penumbra is influenced by several factors; including the distance of the MLC leaf bank from the patient, the design of the leaf ends, and field size. As a result, the penumbra is greatest at the large field sizes. The fact that the MLC is positioned relatively close to the patient compensates for the single focused, rounded leaf end design of the leaves. The 160 MLC can only produce smaller penumbra than the double focused 58 MLC when the field size is 10 x 10 cm 2 or less; for large field sizes the 160 MLC produces larger penumbra than the 58 MLC. This suggests that the 160 MLC may be more suited to IMRT.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion:"}, {"text": "The results presented here suggest that implementation of the 160 MLC for clinical use would allow improved dose delivery and enhanced quality of treatment, as a result of fast leaf movement, accurate field shape forming, and low leakage.

Introduction: There is a trend towards including treatment couches and immobilisation devices in the dose calculation by the Treatment Planning System (TPS) rather than applying a bulk correction factor to account for the dosimetric effects of these objects. Large air gaps (up to 15 cm) that can occur between the patient and the treatment couch and/or immobilisation device can be particularly difficult for the TPS to model accurately. For example, a posterior field to a patient's axilla treated on a tilted breast board can create a large air gap between the treatment couch and the skin surface. Previous studies [1] [2] [3] [4] have investigated the ability of various TPS's to calculate the dose beyond small air gaps but these were for air gaps within the body or for shallow depths beyond the air gap. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of the Eclipse\u2122 analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA) for the calculation of dose behind large air gaps, as compared to Monte Carlo calculations and results obtained from measurements. This work is a continuation of previous work with the Eclipse\u2122 pencil beam convolution (PBC) algorithm which used the equivalent tissue air ratio method of inhomogeneity correction. Methods: Central axis depth dose data in water for a 6MV photon beam (Varian Clinac 600), 10 cm x 10 cm field size and 100 cm source to water surface distance were measured behind a range of air gaps (1 to 15 cm) using a parallel plate ionisation chamber. The air gaps were created by supporting water equivalent RW3 slabs (0.2 to 4 cm thick) above the water surface. The dose for each setup was normalised to that delivered by 100 monitor units at 5 cm deep. For each setup, the dose was calculated using the Eclipse\u2122 TPS and DOSXYZnrc software (with a phase space produced by the BEAMnrc Monte Carlo system) and then compared to the measurements to a depth of at least 15cm beyond the air gap.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1094, "end": 1097, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1101, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1105, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1109, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "The results from measurement indicate that a secondary build up region is present beyond the air gap. As the air gap thickness increased, the dose was found to reduce at the water surface. For larger air gaps, the dose behind the air gap is also reduced at depth. The Monte Carlo calculations confirmed these results. Eclipse\u2122 (AAA) was found to overestimate the dose beyond the air gap. For a setup using a 2 cm RW3 slab before the air gap, for a 5 cm air gap, Eclipse\u2122 overestimated the dose by up to 3% in the first 1 cm depth in the water phantom beyond the air gap and by up to 2.5% beyond 1 cm depth; for a 10 cm air gap, Eclipse\u2122 overestimated the dose by up to 4.5% in the first 4 cm beyond the air gap and by up to 3% beyond 4 cm depth; and for a 15 cm air gap, Eclipse\u2122 overestimated the dose by up to 5% in the first 5 cm beyond the air gap and by up to 3.5% beyond 5 cm depth. This trend was evident for all setups investigated in this study. Discussion: The Eclipse\u2122 AAA dose calculation overestimated the dose beyond the air gap but was found to predict the presence of a secondary build up region, which increased with increasing air gap thickness. This is a considerable improvement on the calculations resulting from previous work investigating the Eclipse\u2122 PBC algorithm with the equivalent tissue air ratio method of inhomogeneity correction which did not predict a secondary build up region beyond an air gap of any thickness. AAA did not predict the reduction in dose beyond the secondary build up region created beyond large air gaps. The results were similar to those from the PBC algorithm. The errors in the dose calculation by AAA can be attributed to the approximations within the algorithm, particularly with respect to scattered radiation. the dose measured at different depths, without specifying the actual depths used. A linear regression was performed through the data points of the dose difference and mean dose. Results and Discussion: Bland-Altman plots were generated by comparing depth doses from the Farmer chamber with those of the parallel plate chambers. The minimum depth for comparison was 5 mm due to the diameter of the Farmer chamber. For the NACP and Roos chambers, the mean dose difference with the Farmer chamber was 0.1% and a standard deviation of 0.1%. For the Markus chamber, the mean dose difference with the Farmer was 1% and one standard deviation of 1%. The results also indicate a trend for the Markus to over respond with increasing depth, as compared to the Farmer chamber.

We also obtained profiles across other regions of this pattern including the dynamic leaf gap region and the interleaf leakage region. Introduction: Most commercially available in vivo dosimeters are dose rate and/or field size dependent. In vivo measurements for complex dynamic treatments such as IMRT are therefore difficult, because dose rate and field size change during the delivery of a single field and it is not practical to apply correction factors. Previous work 1 concluded that errors introduced by the field size dependence are reduced by using a 6 cm diameter water-equivalent scatter disk around the detector instead of the traditional metal buildup cap. OneDose TM MOSFET detectors are packaged with minimal overlying material and should be used with additional buildup material. In contrast, the OneDose TM Plus MOSFET detectors have a thin metal disk glued to the top and the manufacturer states that these can be used without additional build up material. This study aims to determine the response of OneDose TM and OneDose TM Plus dosimeters in static fields and complex dynamic fields. Methods: OneDose TM dosimeters (under a 6 cm diameter wax scatter disc) and OneDose TM Plus dosimeters (with no added scatter material) were placed on the surface of a solid phantom and exposed to static square fields and dynamic fields (sliding window, pyramid and inverse pyramid fields) using 6 MV photon beams from a Varian 21EX. Their responses were compared to the response of a diamond detector at d max for the static fields and a 0.125 cc ion chamber at d max for the dynamic fields.

Collection and correlation of this data may be used to suggest when and how to intervene and appropriately adapt the treatment to conform with the intended prescribed dose. Introduction: The motivation for developing megavoltage (and kilovoltage) cone beam CT (MV CBCT) capabilities in the radiotherapy treatment room was primarily based on the need to improve patient set-up accuracy. There has recently been an interest in using the cone beam CT data for treatment planning. Accurate treatment planning, however, requires knowledge of the electron density of the tissues receiving radiation in order to calculate dose distributions. This is obtained from CT, utilising a conversion between CT number and electron density of various tissues. The use of MV CBCT has particular advantages compared to treatment planning with kilovoltage CT in the presence of high atomic number materials and requires the conversion of pixel values from the image sets to electron density. Therefore, a study was undertaken to characterise the pixel value to electron density relationship for the Siemens MV CBCT system, MVision, and determine the effect, if any, of differing the number of monitor units used for acquisition. If a significant difference with number of monitor units was seen then pixel value to ED conversions may be required for each of the clinical settings. The calibration of the MV CT images for electron density offers the possibility for a daily recalculation of the dose distribution and the introduction of new adaptive radiotherapy treatment strategies. Methods: A Gammex Electron Density CT Phantom was imaged with the MVCB CT system. The pixel value for each of the sixteen inserts, which ranged from 0.292 to 1.707 relative electron density to the background solid water, was determined by taking the mean value from within a region of interest centred on the insert, over 5 slices within the centre of the phantom. These results were averaged and plotted against the relative electron densities of each insert with a linear least squares fit was preformed.

Several recent studies on prostate cancer patients show that in many hospitals patients are treated with higher than conventional radiation dose. Results of the randomized trials confirm that dose escalation improves the biochemical control rates. The gradual escalation of prescription dose affects the dose distributions. Radiobiological models are being used to evaluate and predict the outcome of a treatment plan in terms of both tumour control probability (TCP) and a normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). In this study linear quadratic model has been used to investigate the radiobiological effects of dose escalation in a three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and an intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment plans for a prostate cancer patient. Methods: Two 3D-CRT (one with 4 beams, another with 5 beams) and an IMRT treatment plans were developed with an initial prescription dose of 60 Gy in 2 Gy/fraction to prostate. Then the prescription dose was gradually increased from 60 Gy to 70 Gy in 1 Gy steps to investigate the sensitivity of TCP and NTCP to dose escalation. Plans were developed for an increasing number of fractions (30 to 35 fractions) keeping dose/fraction constant (2 Gy/fraction) and also for increased dose/fraction keeping the number of fractions the same (30 fractions). TCP, NTCP and complication free tumour control probability (P+) were calculated using the Pinnacle planning systems. Results: Table 1 shows a brief summary of the TCP, composite NTCP and P+ for three treatment plans for different prescription doses planned in 2 Gy/fraction. Discussion: When the dose is increased, both the TCP and NTCP increased gradually as expected. In all cases TCPs increase with the dose, but as NTCPs also increase with them, overall P+ is not always optimum at the highest prescription dose. The optimum value for P+ was obtained for IMRT plan with the prescription dose 66 Gy planned in 33 fractions with a fraction size of 2 Gy. For high prescription doses, fraction size 2 Gy gave P+ higher than those from the fixed number of fractions. At higher prescription doses, fraction size increased when fraction number was fixed. The large fraction size causes the high NTCP. Accurately delivered IMRT reduces the complication rate among the organs at risk.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1784, "end": 1791, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "The characteristics of a proton Bragg peak allow most of the dose to be deposited at depth. This ensures highly conformal dose distributions to be delivered during proton therapy with lower integral doses than those possible with x-ray techniques. The range of a proton beam in tissue is finite, meaning doses distal to the target receive close to zero dose. The choice of treatment modality is also influenced by the risk of secondary malignancy from radiotherapy. There is currently no definitive model to describe secondary cancer incidence as a function of dose, but even doses of less than 6 Gy are believed to be capable of inducing malignancy 1 . Methods: Treatment plans for a prostate cancer patient were generated for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), passively scattered proton therapy (PT) and intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) using an Eclipse treatment planning system. All IMRT plans employed between 5 and 9 fields to ensure acceptable dose conformality in the target and used inverse planning for optimisation. PT plans employed two lateral beams of equal weight, assuming a double scattering technique of beam generation and were forward planned. IMPT plans employed inverse planning. The treatment plans were evaluated through DVH analysis for the PTV and critical structures. Results: Figure 1 shows a treatment plan using PT (left) and IMRT (right) for the same patient. The minimum dose shown is 4 Gy. Both IMRT and PT give acceptable target coverage with higher dose conformality achieved in the PTV by the PT plan. The PT plan irradiated approximately 14% of normal tissue volume in the CT data set to 4 Gy, compared to 33% in the IMRT plan. The rectum received less irradiation in the PT plan, particularly at low doses. The difference between the rectal DVHs of the two plans diminishes as dose increases. The mean dose to the rectum from the PT plan (36.9 Gy) is lower than from IMRT (40.1 Gy). The bladder also receives less dose from the PT plan (9.9 Gy mean dose compared to 23.0 Gy for IMRT). IMPT plans gave better dose conformality than the other modalities with better rectal sparing (30.9 Gy mean dose). Normal tissue exposure was also reduced by IMPT. Discussion: As dose conformality in the PTV for the IMRT plan approached that of the PT plan, the level of normal tissue sparing diminished. Improving tissue sparing in IMRT is only possible by reducing the target dose conformality. The PT plan prescribes a more conformal target dose with less irradiation of critical structures and normal tissue. Adding intensity modulation increases conformality and further reduces normal tissue exposure. Increasing the number of beams can increase conformality in both modalities, but normal tissue exposure would also increase. The lower integral doses predicted in the proton plans may result in lower levels of secondary cancer incidence. However, the proton therapy plans only account for scattered primary protons in the dose calculation and does not consider the dose from secondary particles such as neutrons. Failure to account for secondary particles can result in dose errors in the region of the proton Bragg peak 2 . The current uncertainty in the RBE of neutrons means that from these plans alone, a complete determination of secondary cancer risk from proton treatments is not possible. Conclusions: Proton therapy treatment plans can generate highly conformal dose distributions in the target with better normal tissue sparing compared to IMRT plans. Critical structures are also better spared by the proton plans, particularly IMPT.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1325, "end": 1333, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction:"}, {"text": "Introduction: Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy has been introduced in many departments worldwide.

Another potential benefit to utilizing IMRT for head and neck may be a decrease in the number of fractions (or hypofractionation) while maintaining clinical effect to the normal tissues when compared with conventional treatment plans. As head and neck tumours are highly proliferative, this hypofractionation or reduction in fraction number may improve the resulting cell kill, as well as reducing the treatment time for the patient. This modeling study was undertaken to determine the potential reduction in fraction number of a number of IMRT treatment plans. Methods: For a series of patient data sets both conventional and IMRT treatment plans were generated. The Biological Effective Dose (equation 1) was utilised to consider two situations i)maintaining the number of fractions and increasing the dose to the target or ii)decreasing the number of fractions and maintaining the biological effect to the target. For both situations the acceptable effect to the spinal cord was calculated as the BED for the conventional treatment plan. This BED value was maintained. The dose per fraction and the number of fractions was then adjusted for the IMRT plan to determine either the increase in BED to the target achieved when the dose/fraction was increased or to determine the reduction in number of fractions possible if the BED to the target was maintained. An \u04a1 value of 10 Gy was utilised for the target volume and a value of 2.5 Gy was utilised for the spinal cord. Discussion: As head and neck cancer is known to be highly proliferative with extended treatment schedules reducing clinical effect, it may be of benefit to consider utilizing the improved dose distributions achievable with IMRT to hypofractionate. This reduction in the number of fractions and increase in dose per fraction to the target volume could be achieved without increasing the BED to the spinal cord from that resulting with conventional treatment plans. In the example presented here a reduction from 35 fractions to 16 could be achieved. If a clinical trial was to be attempted this could be approached in a systematic fashion gradually reducing the number of fractions and increasing the dose per fraction to the target volume. This would minimize the likelihood that any drastic changes in clinical effect would be seen. Prior to commencing a clinical trial other surrounding normal tissues such as the parotids would also be considered. These initial modeling investigations have intentionally not included time factors in the modeling, as this is the more cautious approach.

For these energies, the average difference between calculation and measurement was 2% with a maximum difference of 3.8%. For the lower energy electron beams of 6 and 9 MeV, the average difference was also 2% but with a maximum difference of 5.0% and 4.5% respectively. The comparison of calculated dose distributions to measurements in a water tank for a 4\u00d74 cm 2 square insert and a triangular insert showed good agreement in the penumbra region to within 2%/2 mm. The agreement between eMC and measurement remains acceptable until the field size becomes less than 1.5 cm for both the 9 and 20 MeV electron beams. This is an improvement on the GGPB algorithm. Discussion: The MU accuracy results with eMC supported our current practise of manual renormalisation used with the GGPB algorithm. This involves renormalisation of the maximum dose on a profile through the centre of the insert in the beam direction. Due to statistical noise in MC type calculations, normalisation to the maximum is expected to result in an error of up to 1%. Implementation of this algorithm, which calculates dose-to-medium, was accompanied by education of the planning radiation therapist and the radiation oncologist as to the effect this would have on normalization, dose distributions and DVH results.

All doses were calculated using the PENELOPE Monte Carlo code V2006 for x-ray beams in the energy range of 50 to 280 kVp. The PENELOPE code requires a primary x-ray spectrum that was determined using an analytical program 5 . The accuracy of the primary spectrum was verified by determining the HVL from air kerma calculations with the appropriate beam attenuator. Each phantom material was modelled in PENELOPE as a large cylinder with diameter 20 cm and length of 20 cm. We calculated two sets of doses for all phantom materials and all x-ray beams. Firstly, we calculated the depth dose on the central axis of the phantoms in order to determine the relative attenuation of the x-ray beam as compared to water. We also calculated dose to a small water voxel located at the surface of the solid phantom in order to determine the changes in backscatter due to the different phantom material. The number of incident particles was selected to provide statistical uncertainties of less than 0.5%. Results and Discussion: For the depth dose calculations, the greatest variation occurred for the 50 kVp x-ray beam. The depth doses measured in white polystyrene (RW3) and Plastic Water had the greatest dose variation compared to water by up to +14% and -19% respectively. This is attributed to the presence of high atomic number elements in the phantom, leading to an increased photoelectric cross section. There were also deviations when using the PMMA and polystyrene phantoms, but of a lower magnitude. In comparison, there was very good agreement between depth doses measured in water and the RMI 457 Solid Water and A150 solid phantoms giving less than 2% deviation over the range of depths. As the x-ray beam energy increased, the agreement in the depth dose between the solid phantoms and water gradually improved. However the Plastic Water continued to give the greatest deviation as compared to water in terms of depth doses. For the dose to the water voxel at the surface of the phantom, the changes in dose varied between -4.5% to 10.6% for the 50 kVp x-ray beam as compared to the dose in a water phantom only. The greatest deviation occurred for the polystyrene and RW3 solid phantoms. In comparison, the doses measured in the RMI457 Solid Water were in excellent agreement with doses to water, giving differences of less than 0.5%. These changes in dose for the phantoms studied are consistent with measured dose output factors for a kilovoltage x-ray unit 2 . Conclusion: In this work, we have demonstrated that some solid phantoms can give significant differences if used for dosimetry of low energy photon beams. This occurs whether the solid phantom is used for depth dose measurements or for providing backscatter material. If one had to measure dose in a solid phantom at these energies, the best choice would be the RMI 457 Solid Water, Virtual Water or A150 phantom materials. It is recommended that any dose differences between a solid phantom and water be quantified before the clinical use of the solid phantom, checking the relative absorption and scattering.

This is because for the former, protons interact with fewer beam modifying devices which will emit scattered primary radiation and neutrons. We utilized silicon-oninsulator (SOI) microdosimeters and microdosimetry techniques to determine the dose equivalent in close proximity to proton pencil beams and compared the results to both Monte Carlo simulations and analogous measurements of passively scattered proton treatment fields. Methods: From measured microdosimetry spectra we determined the dose equivalent deposited up to 10 cm laterally from the center of stationary proton pencil beams and up to 8 cm downstream of the Bragg peak. These measurements were performed using an array of SOI diodes, each with a sensitive volume similar to biological cells, that simultaneously provide the dose deposited and the spectra of energy deposition events within each sensitive volume. Information from the spectra of energy deposition events allows one to determine the average quality factor using established microdosimetric methods and the dose equivalent at each detector position. The small (1.2 x 3.6 x 0.01 mm 3 ) size of the sensitive volume array is ideally suited to this near-field region as high spatial resolution is required in regions of steep dose gradients. Measurements were also performed for passive scattering fields using the same experimental setup and microdosimeter as the pencil-beam measurements. In addition, we modeled the expected detector response with a GEANT 4.8.0 Monte Carlo simulation. Results: GEANT4 simulations show that the dose equivalent lateral to the pencil beam is dominated by contributions from scattered primary protons and not neutrons. These protons are scattered through wide angles in the phantom and upstream windows required for ionization chambers and vacuum. The dose equivalent due to neutron events dominate downstream of the Bragg peak, and therefore the average quality factor differs in this region compared to the lateral region. From the experimental results the average quality factor was 2 lateral to the pencil beam and 7 downstream of the Bragg peak. The GEANT4 simulations were used to virtually scan the experimental pencil beams to produce a 3-D irradiation, which was compared to measurements in the passively scattered field. Results indicate that the dose equivalent in the lateral regions were within +10% to -30% of analogous positions in the passively scattered field. Conclusions: It is important to utilize a dosimeter with high spatial resolution and established quality factors when determining the dose equivalent and average quality factor as the radiation field depends on the detector position. SOI microdosimeters and microdosimetry techniques provide such a tool with which to determine these quantities directly from experimental data. Preliminary results suggest that the differences in the dose equivalent near the treatment field from a scanned 3-D irradiation and an analogous passive scattered field are not significant when the same number of primary protons are delivered to the phantom. We hypothesize that for a given field we obtain comparable dose equivalent in the lateral region near the treatment field using pencil beam scanning and passive scattering (as the scattering of primary protons in the phantom will be the same). Pencil beam scanning can have better conformation of the dose in the proximal region compared to passive scattering and can, however, produce less dose in the near-field region if fewer protons are required to treat a target volume. At the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, the eMC (v7.5.14.3, v7.5.18 and v8.0.05) algorithm is used for clinical plans which involve either, a complex surface area, inhomogeneities, build-up material, electron/photon combinations, junctional electron fields or skin to surface distances (SSD) greater than 105 cm. In addition, eMC is used when the electron field represents the main contribution to a radical prescribed treatment course or if dose information to a critical structure is required. As part of the clinical introduction of the eMC algorithm, verification of skin dose under bolus for a range of eMC planned patients was performed. Methods: Patient groups requiring eMC for their planning include en-face head and neck, breast, axilla photon/electron junctions and scalp. The en-face patient plans are varied and have included a large single field or a combination of feathered and junction gap fields. Optimum calculation parameters 1 were based on reasonable calculation times and accuracy levels for our clinical requirements. Energy-specific calculation grid sizes with 3mm CT slices, accuracy of 2 %, and 3D Gaussian 'strong' smoothing were applied for all patients' dose calculations.

The patients skin dosimetry under bolus was measured with pairs of TLD's and compared with the eMC calculated dose at the same location obtained from the CT images. Results: The measured TLD doses were corrected for the calibrated linac output at the time of TLD measurement to ensure good accuracy in the comparison. The data was percentage depth dose corrected, due to small errors in the build-up region calculated by eMC, varying with energy and bolus thickness, thus improving the skin dose differences. All patients' average skin doses under build-up for the eMC versus TLD's have been within 5%. A total of 29 of the 33 patient's dose results were within 3% agreement. The average difference for all patients at all measurement and TLD locations was found to be 1.9 + 1.2 % (1sd). Discussion and Conclusions: Closer investigation of the four patients where the differences between plan and measurement were between 3 and 5%, indicated these patient's eMC plans presented with steep dose gradients in the TLD region of interest. Complex customised wax created for these patients, required careful selection of TLD location based on the plan.

Many patients who present for radiation therapy treatment have prothetic implants, and where possible, the treatment is planned such that the radiation beams avoid the implant. However, this is not always feasible. It is imperative to test how accurately the treatment planning software models the dose beyond these inserts. With the expectation that the treatment planning system would not be very accurate, the main aim of this study was to quantify the inadequacies of the planning system in a way that the data could be used clinically to provide a reliable dose estimate. Results: Eclipse overestimated the dose beyond the metallic insert in all cases. The over-prediction became smaller as the distance from the insert increased. Also, as expected, the over-prediction increased with thickness of the metals. For titanium, the error ranged between approximately 2 and 9% of D max . In the case of the Cobalt-Chromium, the over-prediction of dose by Eclipse was much larger, ranging from approximately 5 % to 24 %. Discussion: Predictably, Eclipse overestimated the dose beyond the metallic inserts. This was predominantly due to the fact that the maximum CT number that could be specified by the user was 3000 HU. This is an unavoidable limitation when calculating patient dose distributions, as the patient CT images usually contain too many artefacts to use the raw CT numbers. The required CT numbers were 4820 HU for titanium and 9750 HU for cobalt-chromium. The dose perturbations at the metallic interfaces were also not present in the Eclipse calculations, simply because PBC does not model them. A future version of Eclipse (ARIA version 8) will allow the user to input CT numbers up to 20,000 HU. The Eclipse Anisotropic Analytical Algorithm (AAA) also models the interface doses to an extent. Both these will be available at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in the near future and it is predicted they will greatly improve the accuracy of high density material calculations. Despite the current limitations, tables have been created that allow the medical physicist to quantify the dose over-prediction by the treatment planning software, as a function of thickness of the implant, and depth beyond the implant that can easily be used in clinical situations. Conclusions: Eclipse V6.5 using the Pencil Beam Convolution (PBC) algorithm with Equivalent TAR inhomogeneity correction was found to over-predict the dose beyond metallic implants. This over-prediction has been quantified and tabulated for titanium and a cobalt-chromium alloy. This table will be used in conjunction with the patient treatment plan to accurately calculate dose beyond the implant. Introduction: With the introduction of new technologies, the quality and success rate in curative treatment are increasing. But the quality of care depends on a chain of procedures and the final result will never be better than the quality of the weakest link. Great efforts have been made in defining quality control procedures for equipment, patient set-up, treatment reproducibility and dose delivery. But only a few studies explore the uncertainty related to medical decision, prescription, volume definition and all the clinical steps that contribute to the dose delivery process. It is an interesting question that for a patient with prostate cancer, do the treatment plans vary if the plans were done by different treatment planner? To investigate the sensitivity of the model to inter-observer variability at the planning stage, the biological responses obtained from several 3D-CRT treatment plans in the same planning system for the same patient performed by different planners were compared. Methods: CT scans obtained from a local hospital in Brisbane for a particular prostate cancer patient were used by ten different radiation technology students and each of them designed a treatment plan for the patient. The total dose prescribed for the patient is the same (70 Gy) in two phases for all 10 plans. Each plan has a prescription dose of 60 Gy in first phase, and 10 Gy in a boost phase resulting a total of 70 Gy. The differences caused by the target volume variations in interobserver plans influence the radiobiological responses for the plans. To investigate the differences in radiobiological responses to the different inter-observer plans, TCPs for prostate and NTCPs for bladder, rectum and femoral heads are calculated for all the 10 inter-observer plans. Results: The calculated TCPs for prostate, NTCPs for rectum, bladder, right femur head, and left femur head, composite NTCPs and complication free tumour control probabilities (P+) are given in Table 1 . Discussion: All the 10 inter-observer plans result with very similar TCPs. But there were differences in NTCPs for different organs, so differences arise for P+ as well. It is evident that all the TCPs were above 98 %. The composite NTCPs are quite low but quite different ranging from 6 % to 13 %. As a result there are differences among the P+ for these inter-observer treatment plans. Conclusions: TCPs can be achieved by just merely delivering high dose into the tumour volume. Inter-observer dependency of TCP is very low. But as one of the main aims of successful radiotherapy is not to harm healthy tissues, NTCPs must be as low as possible. The NTCPs are very much planner dependent. There should be a detailed protocol for contouring organs at risk volumes and should be followed. This study reflects the comment made by Cazzaniga et al 1 that each department should evaluate its own uncertainties, the statistic of which represents the quantitative criterion to be adopted to precisely define operative instructions. Introduction: With advances in technology, the amount of data generated for each radiotherapy patient has increased. To manage this large mass of data, almost all hospitals use a Record and Verify (RV) system. An RV system is a database capable of storing a wide range of information related to a patient's treatment including scheduling data, image data, treatment history, patient notes and planning data. Most RV systems retain patient setup data collected from image registration which can be accessed and processed to provide useful patient group statistics. Our motivation for accessing setup data was to inform the selection of an appropriate CTV to PTV margin size for prostate cancer patients in our fiducial marker program. Method and Materials: The Peter Mac uses Impac TM as an RV system, currently Multi-Access V 8.3. Impac's underlying Btrieve TM database contains 164 separate data tables, each of which can be accessed using a database report writing utility such as Crystal Reports. Queries were written in Crystal Reports V8.5 linking together a number of the tables to extract treatment time and setup information. The reports were processed through software developed in Visual Basic.NET TM for this purpose. The data was finally exported to a Microsoft Access TM database for further analysis Results: The Access database calculates group systematic and random errors and hence the CTV to PTV margin calculated using van Herk's margin recipe. Toxicity data is also displayed for individuals and the whole group. Treatment time information is also available, and comparison between times for the imaging process using kV equipment and MV equipment is straightforward. Conclusion: Software was developed to allow large amounts of information to be extracted readily from a commercial record and verify system. This has helped materially in the assessment of department treatment margins. Introduction: PMCC treats selected prostate patients with high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR). These patients are implanted trans-perineally with a number of flexible plastic catheters which pass into or through the prostate and receive two or three fractions of HDR treatment over two or three days. Because brachytherapy dose distributions have a rapid reduction in dose with distance from the catheters, HDR relies for its success on accurate and stable location of the implant. Unfortunately, the implant has a tendency to move inferiorly over the time the patients remain on the ward. The cause of this movement is attributed in the literature to swelling due to oedema in the region between the apex of the gland and the perineum, and yet standard nursing care for these patients is to drastically restrict their movement in bed. A study is underway at PMCC to assess whether there is any relationship between the extent of patient movement while on the ward and the movement of the implant. This required the development of a device to measure the flexure and extension of the hip joint.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4819, "end": 4826, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction:"}, {"text": "A new device based on a miniature three-axis accelerometer has been developed to measure patient movement while lying in bed.

Introduction: There are a large number of commercially available radiotherapy treatment planning systems. These treatment planning systems form the basis for the large majority of radiotherapy treatments performed in Australia and in many other countries. Different treatment planning systems utilise different dose calculation algorithms, resulting in minor differences between treatment plans. The recent introduction of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) with inverse planning has added to the potential differences resulting between treatment planning systems. This study was undertaken to compare treatment plans generated with two commercially available treatment planning systems and to conduct an initial assessment of the possible difference in terms of radiobiological effect. Methods: The KonRad and XiO IMRT Treatment Planning systems have been compared in this study. As an initial comparison the calculated dose distributions for a sample of open beams on a flat water phantom were considered to assess any differences in the beam models.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Relative dose"}, {"text": "To assess the differences in the inverse planning algorithms treatment plans were generated for both systems based on a standard prescription to the target and normal tissue dose limitations.

Tumour control probability was determined for the target volume and normal tissue complication probabilities were determined for the spinal cord and the parotids. Results: KonRad uses a gradient descent optimisation algorithm, which was originally written by Bortfeld [1] and uses a pencil beam model for dose calculation. XiO IMRT uses a \"conjugate gradient\" optimisation algorithm, which is a special type of \"gradient descent\" optimisation algorithm. Both methods use the negative gradient of a cost function, with respect to input parameters, to systematically find the minimum of a cost function. The difference between the conjugate gradient and gradient descent methods is in the sequence of search directions that is selected during optimisation. Conjugate directions are influenced by the local gradient but usually do not follow the negative gradient. [2] . Differences were seen in the final treatment plans generated between the two systems. Differences were also seen in the tumour control probability and the normal tissue complication probabilities, primarily due to the difference in weighting between the two optimisation algorithms for the target and normal tissue volumes. Discussion: Differences between inverse treatment plans generated with different treatment planning systems is expected, however the clinical impact of this has not been assessed. The results of this initial comparison indicate that further investigation of the impact over a large patient population is warranted. The impact of these differences should also be compared with the differences in patient treatments due to other facts (e.g. contouring, patient motion and clinician prescription variations). Conclusion: KonRad and XiO have slightly different optimization algorithms, and different beam models. This results in differences in the resulting treatment plans and potentially differences in clinical effects. Further investigations are necessary to consider the impact of these differences over a patient population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 383, "end": 386, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 977, "end": 980, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "COMPARISON BETWEEN KONRAD AND XIO TREATMENT PLANNING SYSTEMS -IMPACT OF TREATMENT PLANNING SYSTEM ON POTENTIAL CLINICAL EFFECT"}, {"text": "External beam therapy quality assurance (QA) requires that plans are validated.

For irregular field, RadCalc calculated output factors agreed with the measured data within 3%. Discussion: Since the square root method in RadCalc uses interpolation to calculate the cut-out factors, the calculation accuracy depends on the square field data entered into the software. The sector integration method uses circular cut-outs to calculate each sector. The calculation accuracy depends on the amount of circular field data entered into the software. For rectangular fields, RadCalc uses formula to calculate cut-out factors. The uncertainty increases for larger X/Y ratio. It is not possible to make the calculation more accurate by adding more rectangular fields into the database because the calculation algorithm does not use the rectangular fields for the calculation. We advise that for elongated field/rectangular fields, first choice is to select a factor from the measurement database (Get from table option) , and if no data is available, then square root method should be used for calculation. For irregular fields both algorithms should give similar results. The calculation accuracy could be improved by using curve fitting for the measured square and circular fields instead of liner interpolation. Conclusions: RadCalc can be used as independent monitor unit calculator for electron beams provided user inputs enough data to the database.

Slow waves originate from specialised pacemaker cells called the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which are situated between and within the gastric smooth muscle (SM) layers. Slow waves depolarise smooth muscle cells, which are required for contractions. In the normal stomach, slow wave activity occurs at a frequency of 3 cycles-per-minute (cpm). Dysrhythmic slow wave activity decreases gastric motility and leads to motility related disorders such as gastroparesis. Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) entrains slow wave activity through external electrical stimulation. However, identification of the ideal stimulation parameters to achieve a desired outcome is an ongoing challenge. We propose computational simulation as a new strategy to identify which parameters are likely to achieve ideal results. A gastric tissue model was developed, firstly showing the normal gastric electrical activity (GEA) and then the effects of applying a 9 cpm stimulus to the tissue. Methods: A gastric tissue model was developed to represent a portion of the stomach as shown in Figure 1a . The model consists of two electrically coupled continuum domains. The ICC domain (Figure 1b ) was described by a cellular automation algorithm providing the pacemaker current (IICC) to the SM domain (Figure 1c ). The SM domain was described using a biophysically based cellular model of gastric smooth muscle cells. Each domain was solved over a 100 x 100 mm 2D layer using the Finite Difference Method (FDM).

Introduction: Bone allografting is a technique that can be used to assist in the treatment of cancer, osteomyelitis, and in the revision of prostheses. Postoperative infection is a major issue in the use of bone allografts, with postoperative infection rates of up to 13% 1 , often resulting in the need for further surgery or amputation. Iontophoresis is the movement of ions across a membrane using an externally applied electric potential. Historically, iontophoresis has been used almost exclusively as a trans-dermal drug delivery system. Using iontophoresis to relatively rapidly saturate cortical bone allografts with antibiotics in the operating theatre setting (prior to their use in surgery) has the potential to reduce the incidence of postoperative infections 2 . This study intends to use iontophoresis to saturate a sample of cortical bone with a radio labelled solution of Iodine-125. Autoradiography will then be used to image the bone to illustrate the exact location of antibiotic within the sample. Micro computed tomography images and scanning electron micrographs of the bone sample will be used to highlight the bone microstructure in the sample, and relate this to the resultant location of the antibiotic. This work will utilise a custom-built iontophoresis cell that has already been developed and tested. Methods: A customised iontophoresis cell was constructed so that a solution of charged ions could be visually recorded as it diffused through a cylindrical sample of cortical ovine bone. The biological stain methylene blue was used to demonstrate the diffusion process, as it is highly visible and has similar electrical properties to the antibiotic gentamicin. The solution of methylene blue was placed in the medullary region of the sample. At the centre of this region was placed a positive electrode comprised of stainless steel. The bone was immersed in a saline solution contained in a plastic cylinder, the inside of which was lined with a cylindrical shaped mesh stainless steel electrode. The fluid in the centre of the sample was separated hydrostatically from the outer solution by sealing the upper and lower bone edges with Perspex and Ethylene Vinyl Acetate foam respectively, and clamping the cell externally. When a potential difference of 90 volts was applied between the electrodes, the diffusion of charged methylene blue molecules from the endosteal to the periosteal surface was facilitated, so the whole bone sample became permeated with the dye. It was hypothesised that gentamicin would undergo a similar process of facilitated diffusion in human bone.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Results: A custom cell has been constructed that can be used to visually record the iontopheric diffusion of a solution of charged ions through cortical bone.

Changes of the heart rate are not appearing only due to respiratory motions but undergone many control processes from the autonomic nervous system. However, in most cases many researchers consider respiratory motions as the phenomenon most influencing the heart. Respiratory artifacts are considered to be one of disturbing factors influencing both the ECG and the EGG. Unfortunately both useful component of the EGG and respiratory artifacts are localized in the same range of frequency. Classical approach to mentioned disturbances removal based on proper filtration leads to artifacts arise in the useful EGG signal as well as to the loss of the part of the important information included in that signal. A new method sorting out mentioned problems is suggested in the presented paper. Methods: EGG signals have been registered with the help of four channels amplifier which can be characterized by the set of the following parameters: frequency range from 0.015 to 50 Hz, gain k = 2500 or k = 5000, amplitude resolution equals to 12 bits, sampling frequency equals to 200 Hz per channel and finally useful signal amplitude range equals to \u00b11mV.

Both the acceleration sensor signal (ACS) and the EGG signal have been registered synchronously. Only one component (AY) has been applied in the examination process due to the fact that other components in the perpendicular surfaces to the direction of the chest motion did not include visible component correlated with respiratory motions. signals lasting from 20 to 120 minutes have been registered during the examination process.

Introduction: Radiation protection eyewear (RPE) is used to protect the eyes from scattered radiation during fluoroscopic procedures and is worn by interventional radiologists or cardiologists, to reduce posterior subcapsular cataract formation. These are typically made from glass impregnated with high atomic number elemental lead and / or barium. Motivation for this study was initiated when a few interventional radiologists received greater than 1.5mSv (Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital lowest collar dose trigger level) in their monthly collar film badge measurements. The aims of this study were to determine (i) the effectiveness of RPE in attenuating scattered radiation and (ii) if the scattered radiation doses measured at collar badges position reflected doses received at the eyes. Methods: In this study, the Aegis ED2 (John Caunt Scientific Limited, Oxford, UK) solid state (probe) dosimeter was used to measure scattered radiation doses. The physical dimensions of the Aegis ED2 probe are 1x3cm, appropriate for placement on the frame of the RPE for dose measurements.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "In the first phase of this investigation, unattenuated and attenuated scattered radiation were measured using a Toshiba fluoroscopic system (Toshiba Ultimax, Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), with a PEP phantom simulating a patient.

Dose measurements were recorded for ten different interventional procedures. Dose area product (DAP) and screen times were simultaneously documented from each procedure. The variability and complexity of the interventional procedures involved made comparison between absolute doses at the forehead less meaningful. In this respect, we have used the normalised averaged dose per screen time as an estimate of the attenuated scattered radiation dose to the eye of the interventional radiologist as a possible index.

The correlation of scattered radiation doses at the collar badge and at forehead was high (R 2 =0.96), though differences (at film badge -at forehead) varied between -3 to 16.9 Sv (3.83 Sv).

The film was investigated to determine the characteristics of this revised film. Methods: Film was exposed on high frequency general radiographic units and air kerma was measured using a 15cc ion chamber and electrometer system calibrated by the National Radiation Laboratory. Film measurements were made using an Epson Expression 10000XL or X-rite spot densitometer and analysed using ImageJ software. Results: The film has a sensitive dose range of 1cGy -400cGy (Fig 1) . At increasing doses the sensitivity decreases as the film saturates. There is also notable energy dependence to this film (Fig 2) . Post exposure growth was found to be ~ 4% for film stored in a dark environment over a period of 78 days post exposure to 50cGy. A strong polarisation effect was observed and concluded to originate from the radiochromic dye layer. Discussion: It can be difficult to compare this film to the previous XR-R model owing to different methods used between investigators. However the characteristics were very similar. Polarisation effects can be a hindrance to accurate dosimetry, however it can also be used to improve the sensitivity of the film with some scanners. Conclusions: Gafchromic XR-RV2 has similar characteristics as the obsolete XR-R. It has a wide dose range a relatively small post exposure growth. Methodology for dosimetry with XR-R should be applicable to XR-RV2. Introduction: Concern for radiation dose to the breast as a result of Computed Tomography (CT) examinations has led to many radiological practices implementing the use of bismuth breast shields. Publications state the reduction in dose to the breasts, from the use of a bismuth breast shield, is from 30% to 50% 1,2 . However there is little information on the effects of imaging protocol, with respect to dose modulation techniques for different manufacturers, on breast dose. Current CT scanners utilise dose modulation because there are dose and image noise benefits. Consequently the aim of this study was to compare the effects on breast dose and image quality of different methods of imaging with and without dose modulation, utilising bismuth shields and to find the optimum method of applying this dose reduction technique. Methods: Breast dose measurements were made using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD 100s) inserted into the right breast of a set of right and left breast attachments (size DD, 1250 mL) purchased for and attached to a male RANDO phantom. All the measurements were performed on a Philips' 64 slice Brilliance multidetector CT. CT scanner manufacturers utilise various methods for performing dose modulation (DOM). This Philips CT scanner has \"DoseRight -Automatic Current Selection (ACS)\" as a protocol specific automatic method for setting uniform noise levels, with modulation options of Z DOM or D DOM. Z DOM is dose modulation in the z (or longitudinal) direction. Based on the scout or surview scan, the mA can vary along this axis to achieve uniform noise along the length of the body part scanned. D DOM is dose modulation that, based on the previous image rotation, varies the mA dynamically ('on the fly'), as the tube rotates through different body angles adjusting the mA for the body part eccentricities.

The female breast is a radiosensitive organ and when using the x-ray for examination, there is a small but significant risk of radiation induced carcinogenesis. The most radiosensitive part of the breast structure is the mammary glands, as these are considered as the place that the breast cancer frequently occurs. The estimation of the absorbed dose by the breast is an important part for the quality control program of the mammography. Therefore, accurate assessment of the surface exposure levels is considered a first step. Additionally, the relationship between the surface exposure and the absorbed dose to tissue as a function of depth is also important. The breast surface exposure is typically translated into a Mean Glandular Dose (MGD) to access the radiation risk within the mammary glands. Method: Even with the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP, 1986), and other protocol agreements of using MGD to measure the risk of exposure to the breast, measuring MGD directly is currently impossible because the glands are inside the breast. There are two methods of measuring the MGD: using the breast phantom or indirect measurements from the surface exposure to the patient. In this research the breast phantom is used, enabling us to have wide range of breast thicknesses, which is one of the main factors that affect the MGD value. The phantom mixtures (compositions) will be used is the standard phantom which is, 50 glandular tissues/ 50 fat tissues. By using the phantom, the effect of different thicknesses on the MGD value will also be tested; the phantom will be on slabs (rectangular) with different thicknesses, and the maximum thickness for the phantom is (7.5 cm). Holes will be milled (on one of the phantom slabs) to place the TLDs. The TLDs are used due to their tissue equivalent properties, high sensitivity, energy and dose response, and small size. In this research different mammographic x-ray tubes are used in terms of target/filter combination; Molybdenum/ Molybdenum (Mo/Mo), and Molybdenum/Rhodium (Mo/Rh) under KVp range 26, 28, and 32. Results: Currently, the set-up of the phantom and measurements is starting in June 2008 at Christchurch Hospital. The expectation from these measurements is to find the MGD at different depth in the breast not just at a fixed depth (standard depth) by applying a range of KVp using different x-ray tubes target/filter materials. These measurements will be used to estimate the radiation dose values that are necessary for quality control and optimization. Discussion: Of the results will be presented. this purpose. The tube furnace operates on the principle that if the target material can be vapourised, and the vapour blown down a tube subject to a temperature gradient, the 96 Tc will plate out onto the walls of the tube at a different location to the other components of the target. Methods: The 96 Tc was produced in the cyclotron by bombarding a 1 cm diameter, 0.5 mm thick natural molybdenum target with 18 MeV protons. Because Mo has a very high melting point (2617qC), it is necessary to first oxidize the target before it can be vapourised (MP MoO 3 795qC). Oxidation was achieved by dissolving the molybdenum in 6M nitric acid and then calcining it to dryness to produce MoO 3 . Because it is not practical to irradiate Mo in a cyclotron every time the furnace is used, experiments were performed with MoO 3 spiked with 99m Tc, or 99m Tc alone. The spiked MoO 3 or 99m Tc was placed in a small ceramic boat which was loaded into the tube furnace. The tube furnace consisted of a 110 cm long quartz glass tube surrounded by heating elements embedded in ceramic, which was in turn wrapped in insulating material. A 25 cm long removable end-piece, which protruded beyond the heating elements and insulating material, was attached to the cool end of the tube via a ground glass bayonet joint. Because the end-piece is not heated or insulted, vapour entering the end-piece cools rapidly to room temperature. The tube was heated by three separate heating elements, each having a maximum temperature setting. These were initially set to 850qC, 650qC, and 500qC, producing a temperature gradient ranging from 700qC at the hot end of the tube down to 350qC, with a maximum temperature of approximately 850qC 15 cm from the hot end of the tube and the optimal position for ceramic boat. The heating elements were controlled such that when the furnace was switched on, the last two elements (650qC, and 500qC) began heating. Once they reached their target temperature, the last element was activated. Oxygen was blown through the tube at 60 cc min -1 . The temperature at the hot end is sufficient to melt the target material and release both the MoO 3 and the technetium oxide (Tc 2 O 7 ). The vapour encouraged to flow with the introduction of the oxygen along the tube, and the MoO 3 and Tc 2 O 7 plate out along the walls once the temperature is below each elements specific condensation point. MoO 3 vapour will condense back to a solid at a higher temperature than Tc 2 O 7 and by varying the temperature gradient appropriately, the MoO 3 should plate out earlier than the Tc 2 O 7 which may be gathered in the endpiece. This can then be removed and rinsed with saline to remove the Tc 2 O 7. Results: The target was dissolved and calcined successfully, with particular attention paid to the concentration of the nitric acid used. It was found that 6 M fully dissolved the target in 5 minutes at 100qC, although increasing the concentration to 11 M slowed the reaction considerably, presumably due to the oxidation of the surface creating a barrier. It was found to be necessary to remove the oxide layer before the Mo could be dissolved; this was achieved by placing it in 7M NH 4 OH. When the MoO 3 was heated in the furnace it plated out as crystalline deposits in the region of the tube which corresponded to a temperature range of approximately 800qC to 650qC. By measuring the activity along the tube with a collimated contamination monitor, the region of technetium deposition was measured and this was found to be at the end of the tube (350q). Subsequent runs with the temperature of the last element raised to 525qC resulted in the technetium depositing in the removable end-piece as desired. Discussion: The system worked as planned, although the MoO 3 plated out earlier than expected. MoO 3 should plate out in the temperature range of at 500qC to 600qC, and the fact that it plated out in a supposedly hotter region of the tube suggests temperatures within the tube may actually be lower than preliminary measurements indicated. Conclusions: A tube furnace that can extract technetium from a natural molybdenum target has been successfully constructed. Work will continue to optimise the efficiency of this device.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3077, "end": 3083, "text": "The 96", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mohammad Zeidan, Lou Reinisch, Juergen Meyer and Samir Abdul-Majid"}, {"text": "PACS.

DICOM handshaking and data transmission can be monitored and log files generated. When using these tools, it is important to have the supplier's permission and to have appropriate security measures in place; the applications themselves use standard communications and should not cause any security issues. Results: When communication issues arise during the commissioning of a modality on a PACS, there is often little error information immediately available. To identify the issue, log files have to be accessed by a remote PACS support or the supplier's service centre. It is often necessary to have several attempts at communications with different DICOM settings before the issue can be resolved. A few cycles of changing settings, accessing logs and waiting for feedback can result in long delays at a time-critical point in commissioning. Using these tools, it is possible to resolve DICOM communication issues such as misidentified AE Titles or unusual reasons for Association Rejections. For example, one of our recently commissioned modalities required a ScheduleStationAETitle for worklist entries. With JDICOM it is possible to configure worklist entries and test for this situation. Another example is of a modality with incomplete licensing that used a Port number which was different from the published one; Wireshark reported the wrong DICOM Port and the licensing issue was resolved. Discussion: JDICOM and Wireshark are relatively straightforward to install and configure, and provide a useful window on DICOM communications between PACS modalities.

Comparison of the dose survey results with published diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) had clearly indicated the feasibility of substantial dose reduction across a large number of QH scanners. Preliminary results of the optimisation process and some problems encountered are presented. Methods: The first stage of this project has been scoped to include consideration of patient dose and scan technique on Philips Brilliance 64 scanners at three pilot sites ie. Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH), Gold Coast Hospital (GCH), and Townsville Hospital (TH). Choice of pilot site hospitals included consideration of the range and number of examinations undertaken, in addition to the interest level of local radiology staff -particularly staff radiologists. The range of examinations has thus far been limited to six types ie. routine head, abdomen with contrast, chest-abdo-pelvis, CTPA, KUB, and chest with portal liver phase.

The urethral mini dosimeter provides online in vivo dosimetry as a safeguard to protect the urethra from hot spots during implantation. The system provides real time dose planning, allowing the plan to be adjusted during the treatment to avoid urethral overdose, whilst still providing adequate dose coverage to the target volume. For such a system to operate successfully, the dosimetric calculations need to be properly verified. The following paper describes comparisons between point source approximation dosimetry, the Task Group 43 (TG43) formalism 1 , and Monte Carlo simulations, and their relative target dose coverage, urethral dose and DVHs, all calculated using the Seed Dosimetry Toolkit. Methods: The Seed Dosimetry Toolkit was developed at the CMRP to calculate the dose distribution of seed arrays in a phantom for equipment calibration purposes. The Seed Dosimetry Toolkit may use the TG43 protocol recommended functions or standard point source approximations for I-125 based brachytherapy seeds to calculate the dose at any point in a phantom, with up to 200 seeds in a predetermined array (representing a treatment plan). The tool is very useful for calculating the expected dose rates along an artificial urethra during testing and calibration of the Urethral Mini Dosimeter. The Seed Dosimetry Toolkit was used to generate isodose curves around a treatment plan within a phantom for both the point source approximations and the full TG43 functions. The expected dose rates along the artificial urethra were also compared using the two calculation methods. 100% isodose curve (a) and urethral dose profile (b) for a 142 seed LDR plan, calculated using the TG43 functions (red) and point source approximation dosimetry (blue).

Often clinicians rely on experience and intuition for MV treatment, which can sometimes result in further damage to the lung units. The proposed research looks to change the current approach by creating patient specific models that can accurately predict lung response to various MV treatments. A critical part lung response is the distribution of recruited and derecruited alveoli, that can change significantly after MV. Previous work and limited clinical data in the literature has suggested that the distributions are normal. However, this paper shows from the results of 8 ICU patients, that a log-normal type distribution is more suitable. The overall result is an improved capturing of the pressure volume (PV) curves and better prediction of PEEP therapy response. Methods: Groups of alveoli and the distal airways are modelled as lung units. The recruitment and derecruitment of the modelled lung units are controlled by the distribution of Threshold Opening Pressure (TOP) and Closing Pressure (TCP), respectively.

If more than one MU setting is used clinically then an average of the CT values acquired with different numbers of MU could be utilized without loss in accuracy. Conclusions: No significant differences have been shown between the pixel value to ED conversion for the Siemens MV CT cone beam unit with change in monitor units. Thus as single conversion curve could be utilised for MV CT treatment planning. To fully utilise MV CT imaging for radiotherapy treatment planning further work will be undertaken to ensure all corrections have been made and dose calculations verified. These dose calculations may be either for treatment planning purposes or for reconstructing the delivered dose distribution from transit dosimetry measurements made using electronic portal imaging devices. This will potentially allow the cumulative dose distribution to be determined through the patient's multi-fraction treatment and adaptive treatment strategies developed to optimize the tumour response.SENSITIVITY OF TCP AND NTCP TO DOSE ESCALATION IN 3D-CRT AND IMRT PLANNINGSchool of Human Life Sciences, University of Tasmania, Launceston.

Traditionally, the validation is undertaken by comparing the measurements with published values for the same make and model of accelerator and similar beam quality 1 . For field size factors used for all monitor unit calculations, external verification using specific machine geometry is now realistic using Monte Carlo (MC) calculations.Full MC treatment head simulations are time consuming but are necessary to calculate collimator scatter factors (Sc) accurately. This work investigates the accuracy of a simple point source MC model for validation of phantom scatter factors (Sp) thereby validating the output factor measurements used to derive Sp. Methods: Measurements for field size factor (Scp) and collimator factor were performed in 6 and 18 MV x-ray beams produced by a Varian Clinac iX linear accelerator. Scp values were measured at 100cm SSD and 10cm depth using a 0.6 cm 3 chamber in large water tank. Sc was measured following ESTRO recommendations 2 . Phantom scatter factors were derived from the measured Scp and Sc using Sp=Scp/Sc. Monte Carlo calculations used BEAM code DOSXYZnrc 3 to calculate Sp for a simple point source model using published x-ray beam spectra for Varian accelerators 4 . Ding5, 6   calculated Scp and Sc for 6 and 18 MV Clinac 2100 beams using full MC treatment head simulations. This data has been used to derive Sp as an external check. Results: The measured and calculated Sp values were compared for square fields are given inFigures 1 & 2 for 6MV and 18 MV. The agreement between local measurements and both MC calculations at 18 MV is excellent being <1% over the full range of field widths.

Nicolau W P Holman Clinic, Royal Hobart Hospital, Hobart, Tasmania Introduction: Quality assurance (QA) of an intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment includes verification of the successful delivery of the modulated x-ray fields by the accelerator and multi-leaf collimator system. This is done by measuring the two-dimensional dose distribution generated for each modulated x-ray field, historically using film, now more commonly with an array of diodes or ion chambers. The measured distribution can be compared, field by field, with that predicted by the planning system -the 'planar dose map'. Alternatively, the measurements can be converted to fluence maps, and used to calculate volume dose within a computerised tomography (CT) data set representing the patient's anatomy. In either case, we are obliged to pass or fail the QA according to some objective criteria, representing the match between a planned dose distribution and that delivered. A popular tool used in radiation therapy is 'gamma analysis', as described by Low et al 1, 2 . Gamma analysis is based on the 'Van Dyk' criteria, which express our tolerance for error in terms of dose difference in regions of low dose gradient, and distance between isodose surfaces in regions of high dose. Gamma analysis generalises this concept, by scaling the planned and measured distributions to our preferred Van Dyk criteria. Gamma is a dimensionless number, whose value is no greater than unity where the criteria are met.Conclusions: When a beam passes through a large air gap created by a patient positioning device, the dose to the patient's surface and to depths of up to 15 cm below is reduced due to a decrease in scattered radiation. While the dose calculated by AAA is considerably better than that calculated by the PBC algorithm, significant errors can still result when using AAA to calculate the dose beyond a large air gap.

The SunNuclear rf-IVD diode system has been designed for in-vivo dosimetry; and in this instance is applied to the measurement of entrance dose for 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams. AAPM Report 87 (2005) details methodologies and pitfalls in diode in-vivo dosimetry. Methods: SunNuclear QED \"gold\" n-type diodes were calibrated for measuring entrance dose, with measurements compared to predicted doses. Commissioning of the system included measurements of SSD and field size factor corrections for the diodes. A feature of the system is its ability to temperature-correct the diode response. This feature was also tested. Results: Field size correction factors for the diodes were up to 0.5% for square field sizes from 5 cm to 20 cm. SSD correction factors were up to 2.1% for SSD's down to 80 cm. A heat pack was used to deliberately raise the temperature of the diode up to 10 o C above the calibration temperature. Application of manufacturer-specified temperature correction factors was found to correct the diode reading to within 0.5% of calibration. Following commissioning, the system was used for measurement of entrance dose on selected patients. Results were compared to entrance doses predicted by a simple dose check program used as an independent monitor unit calculator. The recording of both uncorrected and temperature-corrected diode readings allowed a measurement of the patient's skin temperature at the point of measurement. Preliminary patient results indicate agreement between measured and predicted entrance doses to within 4%. Measured skin temperatures were in the expected range (28 to 34 o C) except when the diode was placed on a thermo-plastic cast rather than the patient's skin. Discussion: Temperature compensation reduces systematic error in diode readings which can be up to 6%, increasing confidence in the diode system in detecting set-up and treatment errors in radiotherapy.

Introduction: The Bland-Altman statistical test is used widely in the area of medicine as a means of comparing a gold standard method of measurement with a new method Altman, 1986, 1999) . One purpose of this statistical test is to determine whether a new method of measurement can be used to replace an established method. The Bland-Altman test compares the two methods using graphical techniques and simple statistical calculations (Bland and Altman, 1986 ). The analysis is performed by plotting the difference against the mean for the two methods, with the mean difference and two standard deviations of the differences included in the plot. In this work, we use the Bland-Altman statistical test to compare several ionisation chambers in the measurement of depth doses for a low energy x-ray beam. Methods: Depth doses for a 75 kVp x-ray beam were measured in water using four ionisation chambers. A PTW Farmer chamber was considered the 'gold-standard' detector and compared with three parallel plate chambers: Markus, NACP and Roos. Depth doses were measured in a water phantom from the surface to a depth of 10 cm. For the Bland-Altman statistical test, we plot the dose difference as measured by the two detectors i.e. (Farmer chamber dose -parallel plate chamber dose) against the mean dose from the two detectors. On the plot, reference lines are included that correspond to the 95% limits of agreement based on the standard deviation of the dose differences.

All measured results were accurate within 3% and 2 mm. Introduction: Superficial lesions are often treated with electron beams in radiation oncology. The dose delivered by electron beams with a radiation oncology linear accelerator has a complex dependence on the shape of the field, the design of the electron collimator system and the energy of the beam. Most of these effects are normally accounted for via an output factor. This is the ratio of the dose with a field shaped insert to that with a standard insert in the electron applicator of the accelerator, measured at the depth of maximum dose under reference conditions. Measurement of output factors for the irregularly shaped electron fields frequently encountered in clinical practice is a time-consuming task. Several methods have been proposed to calculate output factors, see [1] and references therein, with Monte Carlo techniques considered the most accurate [2] . For small ( 3 cm) low energy ( 9 MeV) or non standard source to surface treatment fields, Monte Carlo techniques provide the only reliable calculations. Methods: The latest version of the BEAMnrcMP Monte Carlo code [3] is being used to commission a model of a Varian 21EX Clinac, based on an existing model [4] . Using the method described in [5] [6] [7] , initial matching of model data with measurements is being performed for an open field (40 \u00d7 40 cm 2 ) no applicator configuration of the linac. This will be followed with calculations with standard applicators in place and finally with clinical field shapes in the applicators. Calculations are being performed on a small (~30 GFlop/s) cluster of twelve 2.4 GHz Pentium IV cores using the linux Rocks cluster suite [8], which was specifically commissioned for this work. Investigations are also being made into using Condor [9] to harvest compute cycles on idle machines and the ~200 GFlop/s Sony PlayStation 3 for computations. Results: Initial simulation results show significant variations between measured and simulated open-field applicator-free percentage depth dose curves for 6 MeV and 9 MeV beams, where the simulated beam energies were tuned so the resulting PDD curves match the measured PDD curves at R 50 . Discussion: Commissioning of the model will require adjustment of the model parameters, such as the position and thickness of the scattering foils [5] [6] [7] , to achieve better matching of the simulated linac dosimetry to measurements before proceeding with inclusion of applicators and clinical fields into the model. Introduction: Brachytherapy allows one to deliver a high radiation dose locally to a nearby tumour with rapid dose fall off in the surrounding tissue. In-vivo dosimetry measurements of a brachytherapy treatment are difficult to perform due to the steep dose gradient of the radioactive sources. These measurements may be required to verify the predicted dose from the brachytherapy treatment planning system which assumes full scatter conditions in dose calculations. Previous studies have highlighted the dose uncertainties due to the finite patient size and tissue inhomogeneities 1,2 . The aim of this research was to verify the accuracy of a brachytherapy treatment of a superficial melanoma using in-vivo thermoluminescence dosimetry.

The paper will show that transmitting raw ECG signals over TCP/IP (to be processed by a remote server) is the most inefficient scheme (Scheme 1); implementing embedded digital signal processing algorithms on a sensor node (Scheme 2), parallel processing through multiple sensor nodes (Scheme 3) and implementing a dedicated DSP (dsPIC) processing layer on a sensor node (Scheme 4) improves overall power efficiency important in long-term monitoring systems. The wireless onbody-network sensor node is based on the MULLE developed in collaboration with Lulea Institute of Technology, Sweden. The MULLE is a low power sensor node based on a Renesas m16C microcontroller and implements Bluetooth protocols that allow totally wireless patient monitoring via a mobile phone. Methods: To characterize the power profile for these schemes accurately, the algorithm is firstly standardized. The algorithm consists of a noise removing digital filter through convolution, base line drift removal through differentiation, an autocorrelation function and an adaptive R-R peak detection stage. Low-level (assembly language) programming was used to further standardize the algorithm throughout the schemes. The test ECG signal represents a 4 second epoch measurement at a sample rate of 250Hz, with a resolution of 10 bits requiring approximately 2Kbytes of memory. The execution of the algorithm occurs as soon as samples are converted by the A/D in a single interleaving pass. To aid better visualization, schemes 2,3 and 4 transmits the extracted parameters once every 4 seconds. In practical systems, the 4-second epochs will not be transmitted continuously allowing the MCU to sleep and the Bluetooth module to be in a wait or parked state consuming very low power. The DSP in scheme 4 however is turned off completely during the 4 second A/D conversion by the sensor node and is activated by a SPI interrupt. A 250mAh Lithium button cell battery is used to power the sensor nodes. Current draw measurements are taken in series from the battery supply.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and Conclusion:"}, {"text": "The diagrams below show the power profile for Schemes 1,2,3 and 4.

Scheme 2 processes the 4-second ECG signal on-board a sensor node. This results in the radio used only to transmit the extracted parameters to the remote server. Average power consumption is reduced by 53%. Scheme 3 divides the signal-processing task between 2 sensor nodes over Bluetooth.

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is becoming the method of choice for a number of diagnoses. However, only relatively low temporal resolution is able to be obtained with the conventional MRA sequences currently available on scanners. This restricts the ability to see subtle changes in flow which can indicate partial blockage of arteries and the ability to get sharp images of the arterial system before contrast agent has distributed into other tissues. Our new algorithm is called GUISE (Generalised Unaliasing Incorporating object Support constraint and sensitivity Encoding). It is a parallel method (i.e., using multiple receiver coils) and has similarities to 2D-SENSE, the most successful parallel MRI method in current use. In preparation for carrying out a study on human volunteers, we have simulated the use of GUISE on a set of data acquired conventionally in a previous study.Methods : The principle of the algorithm is that during the sequence of data acquisitions, only the contrast and blood within the blood vessels change significantly with time. By establishing the approximate region in which the blood vessels lie, the algorithm concentrates attention on information known to come from the vessel region. This allows a series of images with better time resolution to be formed and increases the visibility of the vessels. Furthermore, there is no need to synchronise the injection of the contrast agent with the data acquisition.Results: A single simulated result is shown in Figure 1 .

Over the past decade various studies have considered the use of allfiber systems as this presents several advantages in terms of compactness, flexibility and stability\u00b2. However, this type of system introduces significant chromatic dispersion, which in turn broadens the point-spread-function (PSF) and degrades the axial resolution. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that two fiber stretchers made of different fiber types can be used to compensate for dispersion variations resulting from fiber inhomogeneities and from a fiber length mismatch. Methods: Our OCT system is based on a Mach-Zender configuration in which the light from a 110nm bandwidth 840nm SLED source is split and recombined with two single-mode broadband fused fiber couplers. The sample arm incorporates a third identical coupler to direct the light towards the sample and collect the reflected signal. At the output of the interferometer, the OCT signal is detected by two photodiodes in a balanced detection configuration. The variable optical delay line required to scan through the depth of the sample is obtained by stretching part of the fiber with a piezo-electric actuator. Additionally, each arm of the interferometer incorporates another mechanical fiber stretcher. These stretchers are made by wrapping some fiber around a cylindrical piece of rubber in between two metallic plates tightened together by a screw. Initially, our setup was entirely made up of FiberCore SM800 fiber, which has a single-mode cut-off wavelength of about 730nm and is compatible with our light source. Results: From the measured spectrum of our SLED source, we had estimated a theoretical axial resolution of our OCT system to be about 5.4\u03bcm. However, the experiment revealed a much wider PSF covering more than 400\u03bcm as shown in Fig.  1 (a). This is due to a large chromatic dispersion variation that can be attributed to longitudinal fiber inhomogeneities. In order to compensate for this unexpected dispersion imbalance, we replaced some of the fiber in the reference arm of our OCT system with a slightly different fiber (Nufern S630). We selected this fiber as it is single mode at our wavelength, but has slightly different waveguide dispersion when compared to the SM800. After substituting about 7.7m of the original fiber with this new one we were able to decrease the PSF width close to the theoretical limit. Fig. 1(b) illustrates the result. The observed asymmetry is most likely due to some residual third-order and polarisation mode dispersion, and the non-gaussian source spectrum. Clearly, to make our all-fiber OCT system flexible enough and easy to build, we need to avoid having to precisely cut fiber lengths to sub-mm accuracy. To solve this, a fiber-based variable dispersion compensator was built by simply wrapping the new S630 fiber around a second stretcher. We have tested our approach in the following way. We started by adjusting very carefully the length of the S630 fiber to perfectly balance the dispersion. The resulting PSF is shown in Fig. 2(a) . Subsequently, we have moved the sample mirror away by 1mm, compensating the extra optical delay by stretching the reference arm only, thereby introducing a dispersion imbalance of an equivalent-air-path of 1.4mm of fiber between the two arms. The resulting PSF, shown in Fig. 2(b) , appears broadened by about 20%. Finally, we have compensated this dispersion imbalance by adjusting the two stretchers simultaneously while leaving the sample mirror fixed. As shown in Fig. 2(c) , the PSF can be recompressed back to its original width.

Family information recorded here includes the family tree, family number, family name, and the IRD affecting the family; (3) Hard copy records. Each subject has a hardcopy medical record file. Results and Discussion: Details of 1578 subjects are recorded in the IRD register, sourced from 850 families. DNA has been obtained from 671 of these subjects, sourced from 232 families. Table 1 presents the diagnostic grouping of IRD sufferers recorded in this register. From this table it is estimated that the prevalence of Inherited Retinal Disease in Western Australia is one in 2100, and the prevalence of Retinitis Pigmentosa in particular is one in 4500.
