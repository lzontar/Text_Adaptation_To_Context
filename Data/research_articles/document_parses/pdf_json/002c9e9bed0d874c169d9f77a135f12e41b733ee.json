Cellular and extracellular LAPase activity in infected cells was higher than the LAPase activity found in uninfected cells. However, cellular and extracellular LAPase activity as well as total protein kinase C activity was lower in Bestatin-treated cells. Conversely, the incubation of human lymphocytic HUT78 cells with LAPase promotes HIV infectivity. The possible role of LAPase in the pathophysiology of HIV was assessed by determining LAPase serum levels in HIV infected patients. LAPase activity levels were three orders of magnitude greater in sera obtained from HIV patients than those detected in sera of uninfected individuals. Although Bestatin reduced HIV infection, a moderate decrease in the reverse transcriptase activity of chronically-infected H9 human T-lymphocytic cells was observed. Based on the higher levels of LAPase present in the serum of HIV patients and on the combined inhibitory effect of Bestatin on LAPase and on protein kinase C activities, we suggest that LAPase may play an important role in the early events of HIV infection such as viral entry. \u00a9 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Aminopeptidases comprise a family of zinc metalloproteinases that catalyze the removal of 0166-3542/97/$17.00 \u00a9 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Bestatin, [(2S,3R)-3-amino-2hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoyl] leucine, isolated from culture filtrates of Streptomyces oli6oreticuli (Umezawa et al., 1976) , is a potent slow-binding inhibitor (K i =2.0\u00d7 10 \u2212 8 M) of LAPase (EC 3.4.11 .1) with various interesting immunomodulatory properties. Although Bestatin can effectively inhibit other aminopeptidases such as aminopeptidase B and to a lesser extent arginine aminopeptidase, it possesses a high specificity for LAPase (EC 3.4.11 .1) forming a tetrahedral intermediate within the active site of the enzyme (Burley et al., 1991) . In contrast, the membrane-bound aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11 .2), referred to as aminopeptidase-N, the putative receptor for some coronaviruses (Delmas et al., 1992 (Delmas et al., , 1993 Yeager et al., 1992) , is significantly less inhibited by Bestatin (K i = 1.4-4.1 \u00d710 \u2212 6 M), showing distinct inhibition kinetics (Rich et al., 1984; Wilkes and Prescott, 1985) .

The antiviral effect of Bestatin seems to correlate with a decrease in both LAPase and PKC activities following a 12 h preincubation period prior to infection. In this regard, Kinter et al. (1990) have shown that the cytokine-mediated activation of PKC can enhance HIV expression in chronically infected promonocytic cells. Hence, it is possible that the concurrent inhibition of LA-Pase and PKC by Bestatin accounts for the inhibition of HIV infection of newly infected HUT78 and chronically infected H9 cells. The potential dual mechanism of Bestatin-mediated inhibition prompted us to analyze the effect of exogenously added purified LAPase in HIV infection.

In this study, we also showed that serum LAPase activity levels were at least three orders of magnitude greater in HIV-infected patients with as low as eight proviral copies/10 6 PBMCs than in normal healthy individuals. This observation reinforces the implication of LAPase as a key cellular enzyme involved in the pathogenesis of HIV. While the exact mechanism of Bestatin-mediated inhibition of HIV infection requires further considerations such as its direct effect on virus-cell fusion, reverse trancriptase and protease activities, this study provides evidence in support of the possible role of cellular LAPase in early events of HIV infection. Recently, it has been suggested that following the required cleavage of HIV-1 envelope precursor glycoprotein (Env gp160) into gp120 and gp41 to promote viral-induced cell fusion, further cellular-mediated proteolytic processing at the V3 loop and at a novel site located within the carboxyl terminus of gp41 takes place (Rodriguez et al., 1995) . We suggest that LAPase exopeptidase activity may be involved in the further cellular processing of Env during virus to cell and cell to cell fusion.

In accordance with our previous report on the effect of Bestatin on HIV-infection (Pulido-Cejudo et al., 1992) in this report we provide further evidence that emphasizes the role of LAPase and PKC in the early events of infection and demonstrate that the actual number of HIV proviral copies is decreased after in vitro infection of HUT78 cells incubated with Bestatin. Although Bestatin has also been shown to possess in vitro anti-viral activity in lymphocyte coculture experiments (Bourinbaiar et al., 1994) , to date, the potential clinical application of Bestatin alone or in combination therapies remains largely unexplored (Hording et al., 1990) . The clinical benefit of Bestatin in combination therapies is currently under investigation.
