Statistical theory demonstrates that >30 clusters help ensure cluster means have a normal distribution. The larger the number of clusters, the smaller the design effect (i.e. study efficiency improves, and the total number of study subjects needed will decrease). E.g. 40 \u00d7 20 (n = 800) will prove more accurate and efficient than 30 \u00d7 30 (n = 900). 50 clusters \u00d7 30 households will be more precise, but 30 clusters \u00d7 50 households may be more logistically feasible.

If a team can only measure 20 kids/day (which is common), then it's best to increase the number of smaller clusters. \u2022 To permit an equal number of children to be selected from each of 30 clusters, 6 children would not achieve the necessary n.
