We developed a reverse transcription nested PCR endpoint assay (RT-nPCR) and showed that RT-nPCR has comparable performance to the standard RT-qPCR test. In the course of comparing the results of both tests, we found that the standard RT-qPCR test can have low detection efficiency (less than 50%) in a real testing scenario which may be only partly explained by low viral representation in many samples. This finding points to the importance of directly monitoring detection efficiency in test environments. We also suggest measures that would improve detection efficiency.",

These primers were tested for amplification by a primary PCR, followed by a second round of nested PCR. The starting template was cDNA prepared from a pool of RNA isolated from two NP swab samples that had previously been identified as positive using a RT-qPCR diagnostic kit. From a set of 40 candidate amplicons we selected 4 amplicons that gave visible amplification in the primary PCR and strong bands in the secondary PCR reaction as visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. The primer sequences for these amplicons were checked against 78 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Indian isolates. Except for a single mismatch with two sequences in the middle for two primers, all primers were 100% identical to all 78 sequences. These amplicons comprised portions of Orf1ab, M, and N genes ( Figure 1A ; Table 1 ). The amplified bands were excised from the agarose gel, the DNA was extracted, and identity of each band was confirmed by sequencing. Similarly a set of nested primers was developed for the human RPP30 gene as a control. To test efficiency of amplification we used a dilution series of amplicons as templates in primary and secondary PCR. 1-10 molecules of DNA in dilutions of isolated viral amplicons could be detected by nested PCR ( Figure 1B ). To detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in RNA isolated from NP swabs we performed a multiplex one-step RT-PCR on RNA from positive and negative samples using pooled primers for the four viral amplicons together with human RPP30 control. The product of the primary one-step RT-PCR was used as template in separate nested secondary PCR reactions for each of the amplicons followed by detection using agarose gel electrophoresis. Using the nested RT-PCR assay we were able to detect amplification of the four viral amplicons in RNA from positive samples and no amplification was detected in negative samples ( Figure 2 ).",

In order to assess the suitability of the RT-nPCR test for analysis of pooled samples, we performed the test on three sets of pooled samples comprising RNA isolated from different dilutions of a positive sample in a pool of ten negative samples. For a sample having a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 38.7 for the E gene, the RT-nPCR test gave robust detection in RNA from undiluted sample (positive for 3 out of 4 viral amplicons) and less robustly at a dilution of 1:5 (positive for 1 out of 4 viral amplicons; Figure 3 ). For two samples having a Ct value of 28.7 and 34.5, the RT-nPCR test successfully detected presence at a dilution of 1:20. Hence the RT-nPCR test was able to detect presence of all three samples in a pool of 1:5. Direct testing of samples by RT-qPCR without RNA isolation has been described in recent reports (Bruce et al., 2020; Merindol et al., 2020; Smyrlaki et al., 2020) . We performed direct testing of heat inactivated positive samples by the RT-nPCR test. Using 3 \u00b5l of swab sample directly, which corresponds to 1/5 of the amount used in testing of isolated RNA, the RT-nPCR test detected a positive sample having an E gene Ct value of 27.9 but not a sample having a higher Ct of 32.7 (Figure 4 ). Using a higher volume of swab sample gave weaker amplification suggesting the presence of an inhibitor in the VTM. We observed improved amplification when polyvinylpyrrolidone was included in the PCR reaction. Passage of the sample through a Sephadex-G50 spin column also relieved the inhibition and gave improved amplification.",

The NIV set covered 400 samples and had a prevalence rate (% positives) of 15%. The detection efficiency for this set was calculated to be 0.47. The LabGun set comprised 1186 samples and had a prevalence rate of 3.7%. The detection efficiency for the second set was estimated to be 0.44.

It uses well-established methodologies and reagents that are widely available and can serve as a basis for broadening the scope of testing for SARS-CoV-2. The performance of the RT-nPCR test was comparable to RT-qPCR and the cost of consumables for the test based on list prices is around US $ 7 per test about half of which is the cost of RNA isolation. The test uses two rounds of PCR amplification which does increase potential for contamination.

Several studies have compared the performance of different RT-qPCR kits on RNA from clinical samples primarily to assess the performance of the kits, and have found agreement as well as differences that also point to the existence of false negative test results (Hogan et al., 2020; Pujadas et al., 2020; van Kasteren et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020) . However, direct experimental analysis of RT-qPCR negative RNA samples at testing centres using different but related RT-PCR based tests as a way of estimating detection efficiency has received limited attention likely because of the high demand for diagnostic tests, shortage of testing kits, and cost of testing. The low detection efficiency that we have estimated may not be entirely explained by a low representation of the virus in many of the samples as the mean number of positive amplicons by RT-nPCR for the 12 false negatives (10 NIV + 2 LabGun) was 3.25 ( Figure 5 ). Possible alternative explanations are variability in test performance or in representation of different portions of the viral RNA. Low detection efficiency could be a possible concern in other tests including those under development that are based on reverse transcription as a first step followed by DNA amplification and detection (Broughton et al., 2020; Rauch et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) . Many 8 RT-qPCR tests use RNA corresponding to about 1% of swab sample. Increasing the amount of sample for RNA isolation and concentration of the sample are possible options for improving detection, however these would also increase the number of operations and expense, and it would need to be assessed whether this would be compatible with medium to high throughput protocols. Protocols based on initial detection of a single amplicon followed by a confirmatory test for a second amplicon may also contribute to false negatives and lower detection.",

The results indicated that the agreement between the RT-nPCR and NIV tests could be rated as moderate (Cohen's Kappa = 0.612, 95% CI: 0.42-0.81) (McHugh, 2012) while that between the RT-nPCR and LabGun tests could be rated as almost perfect (Cohen's Kappa = 0.905, 95% CI: 0.80-1.0;)(Figure 5). The lower agreement with the NIV set was due to 10 samples that were negative by the NIV protocol but positive in the RT-nPCR test. The mean number of positive amplicons for these 10 samples was 3.3 indicating that they were likely to be true positives (i.e. false negatives). Based on the number of RNA samples that were negative in the RT-qPCR tests but positive by RT-nPCR we derived an estimate of the proportion of positive samples that were being detected by the NIV and LabGun RT-qPCR tests (",
