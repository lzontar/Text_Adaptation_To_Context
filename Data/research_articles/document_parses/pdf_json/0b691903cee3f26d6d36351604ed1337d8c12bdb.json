We noticed a strong pro-inflammatory response in all cases (CRP, IL-6 or 84 IP-10), which started early and remained positive while IFN-I response decrease after day 10 of 85 infection (Figure 1B-D). Patients with no IFN-\u03b1 production presented poorer outcome, all of them 86 requiring invasive ventilation (n=5/5) and showing a longer ICU stay (Table 1). The viral load tended 87 to be higher in IFN-negative COVID-19 patients at disease diagnosis. IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb were 88 undetectable while low amount of IFN-\u03b3 was detected in all patients with no evident link with IFN-\u03b12 89 level (supplemental Figure 2B-D of this article's Online Repository). 90Taken together, our data demonstrates a heterogeneous pattern of IFN-\u03b1 response in COVID-19 91 patients with IFN-I response being impaired in about 1/5 of critically ill patients. This defective innate 92 immune response may be associated with a poor outcome. In murine models of SARS-CoV-1 93 infection, delayed IFN-I production is associated with lung lesions and fatal outcome while early 94 administration of IFN-I prevents lung lesions 6 . SARS-CoV-2 displays a better sensitivity to IFN-I in vitro 95 compared to SARS-CoV-1 virus in infected cell lines 7 . Therefore, early administration of IFN-\u03b12 might 96 be promising for COVID-19 patients, especially in those who demonstrate a defective IFN response. 97",
