As of 31 May 2020, the disease has reached over 200 countries and territories, causing more than 5.9 million infections and 360,000 deaths (WHO 2020). COVID-19 is also having a detrimental impact on patients with underlying diseases (such as cancer) and ongoing clinical trials. Some of its impacts are direct, e.g. infections and deaths (Dai et al. 2020) . Others are indirect but still deeply concerning, e.g. increased demands on the health service, travel restrictions and measures of social distancing, leading to clinical site closures, treatment interruptions/discontinuations and delayed/missed trial visits (Singh and Chaturvedi 2020) . In March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency issued separate guidance on the conduct of clinical trials during COVID-19 (FDA 2020; EMA 2020a) . The call to action was clear: 1) Ensure the safety of trial participants; 2) To minimize the risks to trial integrity and maintain compliance with good clinical practice, trial sponsors should document changes in trial conduct due to COVID-19, duration of those changes, and how trial conduct and results were impacted.",

Each estimand is made up of five attributes (Figure 1 ). Together, the attributes determine how different patient journeys in a clinical trial are accounted for, what data to collect, and what statistical method to use to estimate the treatment effect. Sensitivity analyses may be pre-specified to explore the estimator's robustness of inference to model assumptions (Degtyarev et al. 2019) . Figure 1 . Covid-19 Impact Assessment. An estimand or \"target of estimation\" consists of five attributes: treatment, population, variable, (other) intercurrent events, and summary. We pose a key question for each attribute to facilitate COVID-19 impact assessment on whether the planned analysis of an ongoing clinical trial can still address the original clinical trial objective (in italics).",

By having a precise definition of the initial target of estimation, sponsors of ongoing clinical trials can better identify potential sources of bias due to the pandemic. They can then answer the following questions with clarity and objectivity: \"Can the estimate from my initially planned analysis still provide an answer to my clinical trial objective?\" and \"Will the data collected and trial results be useful for informing clinical practice in a world without COVID-19 pandemic?\" If the answer to at least one of these questions is no, mitigative measures may need to be taken, e.g. by clarifying the primary estimand, modifying the estimator, adding sensitivity analyses, or introducing supplementary estimands. Ratitch et al. (2019) discuss further exploratory analyses before unblinding that may help to provide supplementary evidence for interpretation of trial results.",

PI assumes that, conditional on baseline confounders, the potential outcome (e.g. PFS or OS) for the treated (untreated) is independent of the potential outcome of the COVID-19 status for untreated (treated). Stated differently, once baseline covariates that may confound the relationship between COVID-19 status and the outcome variable are known, knowing the COVID-19 status of the treated (untreated) provides no further information on the outcome for the untreated (treated) and vice versa.

As has been argued elsewhere, in the case of NPH no single summary measure can adequately capture the treatment effect entirely and alternative measures might need to be considered (Royston and Parmar 2020) . Examples are difference of survival functions at a milestone or restricted-mean survival time. However, it is recognized that these alternative measures of efficacy pose their own challenges (Freidlin and Korn 2019) .

Alternative tests that optimize power under specific scenarios for the underlying survival functions have been proposed, see e.g. Lin et al. (2020) or Royston and Parmar (2020) . On the other hand, the logrank test remains valid under NPH at the cost of reduced power. As Freidlin and Korn (2019) argue, the logrank test is quite robust over a broad range of NPH scenarios, so that power loss may be compensated through a modest increase in necessary number of events (~10%) which may require increased follow-up. So, whether to change the primary hypothesis test specified pre-pandemic also requires careful consideration. Simulations might help in this assessment. During the pandemic, missing data may be induced due to travel restrictions and disruptions of the healthcare system. Specific to oncology, multiple tumour imaging scans may be missing before death/cancer progression. The importance of capturing details explaining the basis of the missing data and reporting it in the clinical trial report was highlighted in regulatory guidelines on COVID-19 impact (FDA 2020). Accurate collection of reasons for missing data, although challenging in practice, would further facilitate the exploration of the mechanism of missing data.",

Response is usually observed at one of the first assessments in the trial, in which case ICEs due to or missing data at later timepoints are less likely to affect ORR evaluation. Generally, less missing data may be expected at first assessment considering its importance to determine the course of treatment and disease status for the patient. Moreover, if responses are durable, then it could still be observed at future assessments even if the first assessment is missing. More careful assessment of missing data mechanisms may be required for trials requiring confirmation of response, as it may not be captured if scans are missing before later progression. Deaths due to COVID-19 prior to an observed response would be typically considered non-responder (composite strategy as for all other early deaths) but similar considerations as described in Section 2 apply. No ideal approach for estimation of a hypothetical estimand for ORR seems to be available, but it could be done e.g. by imputing response / nonresponse for patients who died due to COVID-19 with a probability estimated from the proportion of responders among appropriately defined \"similar patients\" who had evaluable data. Alternatively, if the number of early deaths due to COVID-19 is low, an approximate estimate of a hypothetical estimand could be obtained by excluding such patients or just counting them as non-responders.",

Careful assessment of COVID-19 impact on safety analyses is required to ensure that trial results reflect the true safety profile of the study drug and, for example, the proportion of patients experiencing infection on trial treatment is not overestimated due to COVID-19 events. Such events might be declared as competing and estimators other than the simple incidence proportion, e.g. the Aalen-Johansen estimator, may potentially give more accurate estimates of the absolute AE risk of the actual treatment (Aalen and Johansen 1978; Stegherr et al. 2019) , with the same limitation of patients potentially only being at risk during the pandemic, see Section 3.2.

Some considerations for this assessment are provided in Section 2.5 and in Table 1 . Bias may be introduced if the administered treatment regimen (including interruptions, delays, concomitant medications) in a trial is no longer representative of the intended treatment regimen. Two aspects appear to be particularly important when determining whether using treatment policy strategy to handle these ICEs is still meaningful: the potential relationship with disease progression and any effect of the treatment (e.g. immunosuppression), and interpretability of the data after the COVID-19 related ICEs, including if a patient starts new therapy or delays an intervention (e.g. surgery, transplant). For ICEs primarily caused by the disruption of healthcare systems or patients' desire to minimize travelling independently of disease or treatment, we suggest that the hypothetical strategy may be reasonable to address the clinical trial objective. Treatment policy strategy may be more appropriate for discontinuations, interruptions or delays related to COVID-19 infection. Principal stratification assessing the treatment effect in e.g. patients who would not experience severe complications of COVID-19 on either treatment arm may be considered as another alternative to provide insight on expected treatment benefit. The potential use of different strategies for treatment discontinuations further emphasizes the importance of appropriate data collection as highlighted in regulatory guidelines.",

In addition to clarification of the estimand, changes in the sample size and/or trial duration to allow for the observation of additional events may need to be considered.

A question of potential clinical interest could be \"What is the treatment effect in patients who would never experience severe complications from COVID-19 infection, regardless of what treatment they receive?\" The answer to this question could provide additional insight into treatment efficacy in a post-pandemic world where effective therapy is available, in particular if the proportions of patients with such complications differ between the two arms. Such an approach defining a question of interest based on the potential of having (or in this case, not having) certain ICEs under both interventions is called principal stratum in the estimand framework, and in contrary to Meyer et al. (2020) we see potential usefulness of this strategy in our context. Patients in a stratum represent a subgroup of the target population which is fixed at baseline. Although in general it is not possible to identify which patients belong to each stratum, it is still possible to estimate the treatment effect of interest (more details in Section 3).",

Careful clinical assessment as well as external evidence are needed to understand whether these ICEs are associated with worse outcomes that would have been observed even had the COVID-19 pandemic not occurred. Like other discontinuations due to adverse events, it may be difficult to exclude its potential relationship to disease or effect of the treatment. Moreover, COVID-19 infection may remain a public risk for a longer time period compared to healthcare system disruption. Therefore, if treatment policy strategy is used for other adverse event related treatment discontinuations, the same strategy may be reasonable for discontinuations due to COVID-19 infection. Endpoint assessments after such discontinuations would then need to be collected for use in the analysis.",
