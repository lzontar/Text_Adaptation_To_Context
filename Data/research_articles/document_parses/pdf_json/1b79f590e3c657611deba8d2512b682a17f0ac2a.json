Personcentred care needs to be maintained in the shift to telephone consultations. Decision-making skills must account for the changed epidemiology and the need for regular and covid-related care. A comprehensive approach includes covid-specific risk management and health education. Community orientation is evidently extremely important in the context of an infectious outbreak, and, finally, psychological, sociocultural and existential dimensions define the holistic context in which the GP operates. Evaluation of healthcare system responses to earlier infectious pandemics shows various approaches and different levels of involvement of primary care in different countries, but generally a non-optimal preparedness. [6] [7] [8] Difficulties in supply and use of PPE, healthcare decisions such as prioritisation of high-risk patients, support from authorities, lack of knowledge and training and the emotional burden, are factors that compromise an effective response to a pandemic. In past years, various and divergent preparedness plans have been developed in different countries. 9 Data from the ongoing pandemic can help in tailoring strategies for the future. Therefore, this interview study aims to gain qualitative insights into the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on the core competencies of general practice, as they are experienced by GPs in the field. The interviews were taken in the early phase of the outbreak, in a time when a new routine was not yet established.",
