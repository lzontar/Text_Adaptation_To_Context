Evidence from a study in New Delhi, India, suggests that determinants of hospitalization from pneumonia include household crowding (Tiewsoh et al. 2009 ). In a household, the number of persons using a single room at night to sleep may be used as a measure of crowding.

In seven of the cities, a higher proportion of slum households than non-slum households were found to fall into the bottom quartile of a wealth index for urban India (Gupta et al. 2009 ). Thus, caste or indigenous identity, residence in an urban slum and household wealth are expected to directly and interactively result in disparities in household crowding.

For example, the pandemic plan of India fails to acknowledge the potential inefficacy of closing schools in reducing the spread of disease among the urban poor living in crowded environments. Similarly, whereas public markets may need to be closed to ensure social distancing, the potential inability of individual sales people and shop owners to live without that income is not acknowledged. Instead, the plan (MoHFW 2009a) advocates the use of security personnel to enforce law and order if social distancing is the chosen strategy. We advocate a preparedness plan that aims to protect the public through education and the provision of health care, rather than through law enforcement. This is similar to an approach suggested by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the US, that pandemic preparedness plans should be based on the broad principles of health, justice, transparency and accountability (American Civil Liberties Union 2008).

It is unclear, however, whether this was a result of differing quality of the prevailing public health systems and surveillance in states, differential criteria for testing, or genuinely different mortality rates. The MoHFW must use this opportunity to analyse, or make available for analysis, data on H1N1 case confirmations and deaths along with socio-economic and geographic data associated with each case at the national and state levels. Such data will allow us to test the conceptual model presented here, to determine if inequalities in mortality rates existed and to pinpoint the factors correlated with unequal rates of illness and death. This will allow the prioritization of vulnerable populations in the event of a future pandemic. The public health community can use this opportunity to retrospectively study the efficacy of policies that were employed, and to conduct formative research on (a) non-pharmaceutical interventions that can realistically be applied in slums and villages, and (b) the capabilities of various sub-populations to adhere to social distancing and behavioural guidelines.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Health inequalities informing pandemic planning"}, {"text": "The preparedness plan lays out a short-term and a long-term risk communication plan: the former aims to 'create wide scale public awareness and sensitize communities to appropriate behaviors', while the long-term plan aims to 'instill safe practices, increase availability and access of essential services'.

Public health agencies must think strategically about the differential resources of populations, and tailor messages that address feasible, yet meaningful behaviour change in those populations. Some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing public health training and support in remote regions in India have experience designing messages for and working with low-literacy populations. Such NGOs and other community-based organizations are also likely to have trusted spokespersons on the ground, and should be included in planning and in the design and dissemination of messages. Large percentages of the urban population interviewed in the Indian NFHS were designated as migrant in each of the eight cities studied (Gupta et al. 2009 ). Pandemic preparedness plans should take into account the potential for the spread of H1N1 from urban to rural areas by migrants by targeting them with risk communication messages and explicitly planning for how to best reach them for vaccination. Furthermore, in order to reach those who have no access to mass media, the engagement of door-to-door communication is likely to be paramount.

However, this response from the public may be seen as rational, given the lack of reliable information from public health authorities at the time. An ongoing engagement of the media, providing the media with access to information to understand the public health and medical significance of policy decisions, and empathy expressed by public health spokespersons could allay much of the 'panic' expressed by the public. In the US, the CDC held weekly telephone press briefings for hundreds of reporters, followed by posting of the transcript and audio recording of the conference.
