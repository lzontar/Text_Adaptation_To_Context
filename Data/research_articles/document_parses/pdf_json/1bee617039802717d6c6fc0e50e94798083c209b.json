The drugs that bind strongly and selectively to their biological targets are analogous to a dart that sticks firmly to a dart board in a high scoring position.

What they have in common, however, is a lack of oral availability, since they are both too large to pass through the stomach and are broken down by the digestive system. This means that they must be delivered into the circulation by injection or other means. Currently, over 12 billion injections are made annually, a figure that is likely to increase substantially as new drugs based on proteins and other large molecules are introduced to the marketplace. Much effort is being expended by the medical devices industry to find effective means of delivery that can be performed without either physical or psychological discomfort to the patient. Devices such as autoinjectors have made subcutaneous injection (sub cut) a fairly straightforward procedure for self injection, but attention is currently being focused on needle-free devices. These use high pressures to drive the protein through the skin; although this can cause more bruising than with using needles, the technology to improve this situation is being advanced all the time (Aroroa et al. 2007 ). Other delivery methods for proteins are being investigated, including transdermal patches, implants, intraocular administration, inhalation and even oral delivery, if the protein is small enough, using special carrier molecules.",

            "text": "Genes lie at the heart of biology in both health and disease. Through a digital code based on four \"letters\" used in groups of three, each gene specifies a protein with a distinct function in the cell, or in biological fluids such as blood. The path to identifying the chemical nature of the gene has been a long one, starting in 1869 with Miescher's isolation of nuclein from the pus in the bandages of soldiers fighting in the Crimean War. The name nuclein was later changed to nucleic acid and less than 100 years later, the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was announced by Watson and Crick in Cambridge. I regularly pass through the unassuming site where they did this work and look at the blue commemorative plaque on the Eagle pub where Francis Crick announced to the (apparently underwhelmed) drinkers that they had \"discovered the secret of life\". The structure led to an immediate realisation of how genetic information could be passed from cell to cell through the generations, an essential prerequisite for a living organism. DNA is one member of the family of nucleic acids, large molecules with structures that can pair with each other in a highly specific manner. This phenomenon, called hybridization, is essential for the natural function of nucleic acids, and it can also be exploited in a wide variety of laboratory investigations. Furthermore, hybridization can be exploited to target the activity of specific genes and, therefore, has potential use in drug development. For example, if a gene carried by a virus is silenced by a drug, the virus may be unable to survive in the cell that it has infected and will, therefore, die. Alternatively, a cancer cell that is growing uncontrollably because a gene is permanently stuck in the \"on\" position could be stopped by arresting its expression in a similar way. Drugs of this type are at an early stage of development and are based on ribonucleic acid (RNA). This versatile molecule is essential for transferring the genetic code from DNA and translating it into a specific protein. From more recent work, it appears that RNA is also closely involved in the regulation of genes, i.e. the process of switching them on or off at defined times and locations within the living cell. This has implications for diseases such as cancer, where many genes are deregulated, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Figure 2 .3 gives a simple illustration of the relationship between DNA, RNA and protein and shows the point where RNA-based drugs stop the production of specific proteins by silencing the expression of the gene coding for that protein.",

Once bound, this sequence signals the cell to break down the RNA at that point and thus stop the production of the protein specified by that gene.

The phenomenon of RNA interference was demonstrated by Fire and Mello in animal cells in the late 1990s and led to its rapid adoption by the biomedical research community. In fact, the two scientists received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2006, which is a remarkably short time after their initial discoveries. siRNA is used in the same way as antisense and there are similarities between the two. For example, both types of nucleic acid force the breakdown of RNA specific for the gene of interest, have to be chemically modified to improve resistance to metabolism and must be introduced parenterally. The difference lies in the fact that siRNA is introduced as a double-stranded, rather than single-stranded oligonucleotide and is processed by the cell in a different way to that of antisense molecules. As a result of these differences, siRNA is more efficient in targeting specific genes and is being used worldwide in basic research and drug development. The biotech company Alnylam (in partnership with Cubist) has conducted early proof of principle trials with an inhaled siRNA drug designed to inhibit the RSV that infects patients who have received lung transplants. The results, although preliminary, are promising enough to support further clinical development of this novel type of drug (Zamora et al. 2010 ).",

These are distressing genetic diseases that result from mutations (Latin mutare, to change) in a single gene. The number of people suffering from single gene defects, although significant, is much smaller than the number with major chronic diseases such as neurodegeneration or cancer. Therefore, in order to make gene therapy a mainstream objective of the biopharmaceutical industry, the technology must be applied to a broader range of diseases. One example is type I diabetes, where insulin-producing cells have been destroyed by the patient's own immune system. Gene therapy using a gene coding for insulin would allow the patient to make the protein in situ and, therefore, cure the diabetes. This approach works in animals, but trials in humans will be some way off.",

If not enough DNA gets into the cells, there will not be enough protein expressed to compensate for the faulty version produced by the patient. Even if the DNA is effective upon first injection, if it is cleared too rapidly, it will not be possible to maintain levels of the new gene to keep the disease at bay.

This is itself a DNA molecule, often based on the DNA found in viruses. This is because viruses have to infect human (or other) cells to make proteins from their own genes because they do not have the machinery to do this independently. The components of the virus that are used to infect cells can be purified in the laboratory and reassembled into a new virus containing the gene therapy DNA. This virus is then introduced into patients. In the process of creating the modified virus, any elements that might cause disease are removed. Sometimes, for example the components of the HIV are used, which is testimony to the confidence that scientists have in applying this technology to human subjects. Despite the efficiency of viral vectors, it has not been possible to completely eliminate their ability to provoke an immune response in the patient. This response may be a mild inflammation, or a fatal reaction (in a small number of cases), which has cast a shadow over the whole field of gene therapy. Another major problem arises when the viral nucleic acid literally integrates with the DNA in the patient's own cells and causes cancer. This happens because the new DNA switches on genes that are normally silenced in order to avoid inappropriate cell division. These problems have prompted research into alternatives to delivery vectors based on viruses, with a number of promising avenues being explored by academic and industrial researchers.",

There are now over 1,000 clinical trials for gene therapy listed by the FDA, and many of these are being applied to cancer and other chronic diseases, rather than just rare conditions.

Since then, vaccination has, along with better hygiene and sanitation, become arguably the single most effective public health measure in human history. Recent experiences with HIV, SARS and new strains of the influenza virus have brought home the fact that infectious diseases are still capable of catching us off guard, and sadly, we are also living with the threat of bioterrorism.

All medicines carry some risk, which has to be balanced against the benefits provided. There are particular issues with vaccines however, since most are designed to provide protection against future infections (prophylactic vaccination) and are, therefore, administered to healthy people who have to take the risk (admittedly small) of unwanted side effects due to immune system activation. This, along with the relatively low financial returns of vaccines, has discouraged the biopharmaceutical industry from working in this area of drug development. When I joined the industry in the 1980s, working in an immunology department, there was absolutely no interest in developing vaccines. Ironically, I had previously worked in a tumour immunology unit whose long-term aim was to discover how the body uses the immune system to fight cancer. Armed with this knowledge, it might then be possible to vaccinate against the disease. Indeed a cancer vaccine has recently been introduced for the human papilloma virus (HPV) that causes cervical cancer and is helping to revive industry enthusiasm for vaccines in general. However, this vaccine is still based on the conventional principle of immunising healthy individuals prophylactically to prevent possible infection by the virus in the future. The point of the tumour immunology approach is that it should be possible to develop a therapeutic vaccine to treat the disease itself once it has become established. Attempts at producing true cancer vaccines along these lines have been made for many years now, and the work is slowly producing encouraging results. Vaccines are also being developed for other chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's, which, like many cancers, has no obvious association with infection.",

The innate system is the first line of defence against attack by bacteria and viruses, but it has no memory of the encounter with these agents. The adaptive system is brought into play after the initial infection and reinforces the attack that, if successful, will clear the infection from the body. This is where antibodies and white blood cells called lymphocytes appear on the scene. The adaptive system retains a memory of the encounter so that a further infection will be cleared rapidly and efficiently, possibly some decades later. Until quite recently, the two arms of the immune system were seen to be separate entities; from an immunology researcher's point of view, the adaptive system was the most challenging and interesting and the innate system was frankly considered a bit boring. Times have changed, and the field has been energised with new discoveries about how the innate system recognises patterns of molecules on invading bacteria and viruses and how closely it is integrated with the adaptive system. This is highly relevant to vaccine research, since the adaptive arm is responsible for creating an \"immunological memory\" to be activated upon later encounter with the infectious agent. Vaccines are made up of two components: an antigen combined with an adjuvant. Antigen is a general term for the agent that provokes an immune response. The adjuvant literally acts as a helper to enhance that response. This is particularly useful when then antigen alone may not be very immunogenic (i.e. does not provoke a strong immune response) and it also means that the amount of antigen per dose of vaccine can be kept to a minimum. Adjuvants work in part through stimulating the innate immune system, which in turn enhances the adaptive arm. This means that new findings about this aspect of immunology are being translated into a new generation of adjuvants with superior performance to existing molecules.",

DNA vaccination requires the same kind of vector as that used for gene therapy and is introduced into the body by injection or the lungs by aerosol. If the DNA is designed to code for a protein normally found in a subunit vaccine, it will produce it directly in the human tissues and provoke an immune response.

This is because of the excitement generated over stem cells and the possibility of repairing damaged tissue by injecting these cells into patients (regenerative medicine). The human body contains roughly 200 different cell types (see Chap. 5 ) and yet originates from only one cell, i.e. the fertilised egg (ovum). This means that there must be some process operating during development of the embryo (and later the adult) that generates these different cell types. This process relies on pluripotent stem cells in the embryo which turn into different cell types, such as nerve, muscle and blood, during the course of development. Adult stem cells replenish mature cells that have a limited lifespan, such as blood and skin cells, and are present throughout life. Since many Western diseases can result in permanent tissue damage, any therapeutic approach that reverses or repairs the damage is going to be of interest to the biopharmaceutical industry, hence their involvement in stem cell research. In fact, stem cell therapy is not new; bone marrow transplantation to restore normal blood has been performed for decades. In the case of leukaemia, for example, blood stem cells are purified from the blood or bone marrow of the patient (autologous), or a normal donor (allogeneic), and can be stored outside the body, during which time radio-and chemotherapy are used to remove all blood cells, including the leukaemia. The non-cancerous stem cells are then reintroduced into the body, where they divide and repopulate the blood. Although these procedures are hazardous and often used as a last resort, they do open up the possibility of using gene therapy to introduce specific genes into the blood of patients by modifying the stem cells used in transplantation. Clinical trials are underway that use this approach for a number of blood diseases, including AIDS. The transplantation described above uses adult stem cells, but the dream of restoring damaged tissue such as heart, muscle or brain will require stem cells derived from embryos, or adult cells produced by complex manipulation in the laboratory. Pfizer has embarked upon a collaboration aimed at using stem cells to repair the damage to eyes caused by macular degeneration, a major cause of blindness in the elderly people and a large market for drug therapy (see also aptamers, this chapter). Other companies will be watching with interest how a major player like Pfizer can develop a business model for selling this type of medicine.",
