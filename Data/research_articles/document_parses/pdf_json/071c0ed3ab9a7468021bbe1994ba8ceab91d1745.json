            "text": "The coronaviruses (Orthocoronavirinae) are a sub-family of positive single-strand RNA virus with a genome size of from 26 to 32 kilonucleotides, making them some of the largest of the RNA viruses, with a diameter of from 120 to 160 nm. They have a characteristic morphology, with spicules on their surface which makes them look ''crowned''. They have been known since the mid-twentieth century as viruses which infect domestic and wild animals, especially mammals, and in the human species they cause a large number of trivial infections of the upper respiratory tract. They are divided into 4 subtypes: alpha, beta, gamma and delta. 1 In spite of their seeming harmlessness, the betacoronaviruses have caused 2 epidemics this century with major medical repercussions: the epidemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which appeared in China in 2002---2003 , and the one caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which fundamentally arose in Middle Eastern countries in 2012, with a mortality rate of 35%. 2 All of these viruses have a natural reservoir, bats, and they reach the human species through an intermediate reservoir that is usually a mammal. The new virus, which was first isolated in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China, 3 is a new betacoronavirus, although it has a genomic structure very similar to those of SARS and MERS. It was first denominated 2019-nCoV, but the International Committee on Taxonomy changed this to SARS-CoV-2, using COVID-19 to refer to the disease which it causes. This virus causes a respiratory infection that in some cases develops into pneumonia and has an overall mortality rate of 5%, although there are very large differences between countries and the figures are changing very rapidly. 4 Two genes which synthesise polymerase and RNase stand out in its molecular structure (ORF1a and ORF1b), together with gene S, which synthesises the surface spicules. This gene S has 2 subunits: S1, which creates the bond with the AC2 receptor of the cell membrane, and S2, which binds to another coreceptor and produces the fusion with the cell membrane and the entry of the virus into the cell. Once in the cytoplasm, the virus produces polyproteins which are cut by the cellular proteases, giving rise to structural components and the viral RNA which is taken through the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticule, generating cytoplasmatic vesicles that are then released through the cell membrane, creating thousands of copies of the virus in each vesicle. 5 The lung is the most affected organ and is therefore considered to be the target organ of the infection. Nevertheless, some studies underline the multisystemic involvement associated with inflammation and apoptosis of the vascular endothelium. 6 The virus binds to AC2 receptors, which are widely distributed throughout the organism and most particularly in the alveolar pneumocytes, and it causes a cytokine storm in which IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and macrophage migration inhibition factor stand out. In turn these factors attract polymorphonuclear neutrophils, which release enzymes and proteases and aggravate cellular damage, giving rise to adult respiratory stress syndrome, with the formation of the typical hyaline membranes on the internal surface of the alveolar wall, and the resulting alteration of gas exchange and tissue oxygenation. 7 The disease is basically transmitted by respiratory secretions, in person to person contact, by Fl\u00fcgge droplets or by deposits on the ground and surfaces. Oral-faecal transmission has also been proven to occur, although it seems to be less important. Transmission while asymptomatic is possible, as is transmission after cure, which is why the WHO recommends isolation during at least 2 weeks after discharge. 8 Recent studies show that the SARS-CoV-2 virus lasts in the air for several hours, and that it may last for days on some surfaces such as plastic and metal. 9 The average incubation period lasts for 5 days (from 2 to 14 days) and the symptoms are similar to those for a viral infection, with an irritant cough, fever and diarrhoea and vomiting in some cases. Although the majority of cases go on to recover spontaneously, others develop pneumonia and multiple organ failure, these being the most severe cases and the ones with the highest mortality. This higher rate of complications and mortality is associated with an age over +Model Autopsies of suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases 3 60 years old and certain pre-existing complaints, such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes and pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. As well as pneumonia and the said adult respiratory distress syndrome, the complications also consist of septic shock, kidney failure, intestinal ischemia, 6 disseminated intravascular coagulation and rabdomyolysis. 10 As well as the clinical manifestations, CT study seems to be more sensitive than conventional radiology in cases which develop pneumonia to detect alveolar infiltrates that may progress to become adult respiratory distress syndrome, with typical ground glass images. Recently several cutaneous manifestations have been reported, in the form of areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules, urticaria, maculopapular eruptions and necrosis. 11 Viral gene amplification is basic in the laboratory using RT-PCR techniques. In general, this is performed in two stages. In the first determination the E gene common to several types of coronavirus is amplified, and once it has been detected, in a second stage the polymerase RNA-dependent RNA gene specific for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is amplified. Other determinations are based on the detection of viral antigens by means of fast tests that are highly specific but low in sensitivity, leading to a high percentage of false negatives. The antibody tests have the particular feature that they may give negative results during the first days of the infection, given that antibodies only appear once a certain level of immunity has developed. 12",

Post-mortem examinations should be limited in number and scope to a specific objective, taking advantage of the options that are legally available in each country. 14, 15 There is no established scientific evidence regarding the infectious capacity of the corpses of individuals who have died due to SARS-CoV-2, so that protective measures have to be maximised. 16 Several international bodies, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, report that there is no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through handling the corpses of people who died due to COVID-19. The potential risk of transmission is considered to be restricted to direct contact with the corpse or its fluids, as well as contaminated fomites. For the same reason, procedures which create aerosols or splashing, as occurs during autopsy, lead to a higher biological risk and make it necessary to use suitable personal protective equipment. 17 The main international protocols classify the SARS-CoV-2 virus as a level 3 biological risk. This group includes infectious agents that may cause severe human diseases and are a major risk for the community, although it is possible to establish effective prophylaxis to prevent them. The risk generated by these agents for workers may be considered to be acceptable when the proper preventive measures are applied. 18 According to these protocols, there is no reason why a level 3 pathogen cannot be processed in an autopsy room with suitable preventive measures, on condition that it is performed by experienced personnel. 19 Given the risk that the corpses of individuals who died due to other causes may be carriers of the virus, it is advisable to adopt additional measures. These affect the design of autopsy rooms, the air pressure within them and the occasional use of radiology and CT imaging in suspicious cases (Fig. 1) , to avoid handling a corpse. 20 Additionally, the following special measures have been suggested for performing autopsies during the epidemic:",

Antigen tests are less sensitive, and they run the risk of not detecting the virus when the viral load is low, if they are used in isolation. On the other hand, antibody determination may be negative in the first 5 days of the infection, so that this test is not very useful in the identification of a corpse with viral load without a PCR test. 29 The best option seems to be to combine PCR and serological tests, taking samples as soon post mortem as is possible, as they offer data on the viral load as well as the immunological state of the dead individual.",

            "text": "Few works describe pathological findings in those who have died due to COVID-19. The first ones were published in China, and they are restricted to biopsies pre and post mortem with selective sampling 31---33 or minimally invasive autopsies. 34 Other works correspond to retrospective studies of surgical samples from 3 patients operated for lung cancer in which COVID-19 was detected subsequently. 32, 35 Recently, Carsana et al. published their post mortem lung findings in a series of 38 corpses in the north of Italy. 36 The only publications we know of describing complete autopsies are from the United States. The first of these studies, in Oklahoma, is forensic, 37 with post mortem diagnosis by RT-PRC based on nasopharyngeal and lung swabs in 2 corpses. The second study corresponds to clinical autopsies of 4 patients who died of COVID-19 in New Orleans. 38 Consistently with the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, the main pathological findings are located in the lungs. Pleural and pericardial bleeding may be seen in the autopsy, generally serous or serosanguineous 38 (Fig. 2a) , unless there is an additional bacterial infection that causes a purulent exudate. 39 Macroscopically the lung are compact, heavy and oedematous (Fig. 2b) , with haemorrhagic zones and brownishgrey when consolidated. 37---39 Although thrombi are occasionally detected in the peripheral arteries, 38 pulmonary thromboembolism has not been seen in any case, even though it has been associated with COVID-19. 40 In microscopic study, in early forms of the disease oedema, intra-alveolar exudate that is high in protein, interstitial pneumonitis and the presence of macrophages, giant multinucleated cells and some fibroblasts are observed. 35, 41 In an advanced phase, as is the case with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 causes diffuse alveolar damage characterised by the presence of hyaline membranes, fibrin deposits and pneumocyte descaling (Fig. 2c) . 31, 32, 34, 37, 38 The inter-alveolar walls often show inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrate (CD3, CD4 and CD8 positive) of variable intensity 31---36 and they may also be seen to form sleeving around the large bronchial tubes and small vessels. 38 In some corpses exudate in organisation with a proliferation of fibroblasts and interstitial fibrosis is observed (Fig. 2d) , 32---34 although the fibrotic phases is infrequent. 36 Fibrin-platelet thrombi are repeatedly identified in the small arteries and capillaries. 34,36---38 In the autopsies studied by Fox et al. a striking finding was the presence of numerous hyperchromatic intravascular megakaryocytes (CD61+) with atypical nuclei that may be associated with the creation of thrombi. 38 These would correspond to native lung megakaryocytes that had been activated by the viral infection. This thrombotic microangiopathy is only seen in the lungs.",

Lymphocytic depletion has been observed in the spleen, as have degeneration and necrosis of parenchymatous cells, hyaline thrombi in small vessels and chronic disease in other organs. 34 Although there are analytical hypercoagulability markers in the physiopathology of COVID-19 disease, with raised D-dimer and indications of disseminated intravascular coagulation, only Yao et al. describe thrombi in the small vessels of several organs (thrombi in glomerular capillaries are visible in a photograph in their original publication in Chinese), 34 all other works limit thrombotic microangiopathy to the lungs.",
