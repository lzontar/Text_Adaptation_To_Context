A further seven patients received low-dose subcutaneous anakinra in addition to non-invasive ventilation and standard treatment; however, anakinra treatment was interrupted after 7 days because of a paucity of effects on serum C-reactive protein and clinical status. At 21 days, treatment with high-dose anakinra was associated with reductions in serum C-reactive protein and progressive improvements in respiratory function in 21 (72%) of 29 patients; five (17%) patients were on mechanical ventilation and three (10%) died. In the standard treatment group, eight (50%) of 16 patients showed respiratory improvement at 21 days; one (6%) patient was on mechanical ventilation and seven (44%) died. At 21 days, survival was 90% in the high-dose anakinra group and 56% in the standard treatment group (p=0\u00b7009). Mechanical ventilation-free survival was 72% in the anakinra group versus 50% in the standard treatment group (p=0\u00b715).

[12] [13] [14] However, compared with other cytokine-blocking agents, anakinra has a remarkable record of safety and a short half-life, which allows prompt discontinuation, and it is therefore suitable for use in critically ill patients. 15, 16 Indeed, reanalysis of data from a previous phase 3 random ised controlled trial of anakinra in sepsis showed significant survival benefits in patients with hyper inflammation. 17 We aimed to assess clinical out omes at 21 days in consecutive patients with COVID-19, ARDS, and hyperinflammation who received anakinra in addition to non-invasive ventilation and standard treatment outside of the ICU compared with a historical cohort of patients who did not receive anakinra.",

On this basis, use of cytokine-blocking agents has been proposed for treatment of patients with COVID-19; however, data are scarce for the efficacy and safety of these treatments in this population. In particular, no published study has assessed interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade with anakinra, despite previous evidence of efficacy and safety of this treatment for patients with hyperinflammatory syndromes.",

In patients achieving sustained clinical benefit, discontinuation of high-dose anakinra was followed by daily low-dose subcutaneous administration (100 mg twice daily) for 3 days, which was deemed useful to avoid possible inflammatory relapses.

In adult patients, this drug is usually administered subcutaneously at a standard dose of 100 mg/day; 10 however, high-dose intravenous anakinra is used off-label for the treatment of hyperinflammatory conditions, such as macrophage activation syndrome. 13 In view of the short half-life of HR 0\u00b720, 95% CI 0\u00b704-0\u00b763 p=0\u00b7009 HR 0\u00b75, 95% CI 0\u00b716-1\u00b730 p=0\u00b715",

Moreover, opportunistic infections in patients treated with anakinra are rare, 27, 28 and it is routine practice when caring for children with autoinflammatory diseases to not discontinue anakinra during infections. 29 We postulate that severe and difficult-to-treat infections will be a concern for patients with COVID-19 receiving other cytokine-blocking agents, such as anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies, which have a half-life of 2-3 weeks. 30 In this study, comparable rates of bacteraemia and increases in liver enzymes were recorded in patients receiving anakinra or standard treatment only. In patients receiving anakinra, these side-effects occurred after protracted treatment and after improvements in clinical status. Since our study population was especially frail and had multiple risk factors (ie, prolonged hospitali s ation with non-invasive ventilation and central intra venous catheters), we deemed it prudent to discontinue anakinra in patients with infection. Discontinuation of anakinra was not associated with relapses in inflammation or worsening of clinical status.",

Our study arose from a specific need: medical management of patients with COVID-19, hyperinflammation, and ARDS outside of the ICU, to prevent death or escalation of intensity of care. The severity of our patient population was indeed notable: besides substantial increases in serum concentrations of C-reactive protein and ferritin (eligibility criteria for this study), poor prognostic factors included raised serum concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, respiratory failure, older age, and comorbid conditions. 5, 6 Anakinra is already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, is accessible and available, and could represent a safe and controllable off-label treatment to dampen detrimental inflammation in patients with COVID-19. Of note, previous studies indicated that IL-1 inhibition might also limit endothelial dysfunction, 34 which has a role in the development of coagulopathy in COVID-19. 35 Our study has clear limitations. The retrospective nature and the relatively small size of the cohorts (particularly the historical comparator group) limit interpretation of results and preclude definitive conclusions. A more extended follow-up is also needed to assess long-term outcomes of treated patients. Nevertheless, a sound rationale for use, objective improvements in respiratory and inflammatory variables, and comparisons with published studies assessing different treatments suggest that high-dose intravenous anakinra could have clinical benefit in COVID-19.",
