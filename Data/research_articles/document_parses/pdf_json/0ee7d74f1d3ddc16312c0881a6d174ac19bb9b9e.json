This model provides information regarding to the number of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. It also estimates the amount of reported and unreported cases from the symptomatic group. From this study, the authors found that the estimation of unreported cases is extremely important to understand the severity of Covid-19. They also showed the importance of considering the asymptomatic infectious cases to estimate disease transmission rate. From their results, the authors demonstrated the importance of implementing severe control measures by the government to decrease transmission. Anastassopoulou et al. (2020) proposed a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model to forecast the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of SARS-Cov2 and the daily rates of infection mortality and recovery.

This model fits the behavior of Covid-19 in Hubei, being able to estimate key epidemiological parameters. The approach was also successful in modelling and forecasting the spread of Covid-19 in China. Nevertheless, their SIRD model did not consider important factors that changes disease dynamics, such as the effect of the incubation period, the characteristics of the population and effect of restritive policies. The authors also point out to the urgent need for testing and available official data. These factors are crucial to build accurate forecast models, since they are the key way to tune the model by providing a more realistic amount of infected cases. On the other hand, Yang et al. (2020) proposed a modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model and the Artificial Intelligence method Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM), to predict epidemics trend of Covid-19 in China under public health interventions.

And when the correlation coefficient is close to zero, it indicates that there is no correlation between the variables (Witten and Frank, 2005). The value of the correlation coefficient serves as global evaluator of the model, so it is possible to obtain a high correlation coefficient and at the same time obtain high values for local errors. For this reason, it can not be the only metric for assessing model performance.
