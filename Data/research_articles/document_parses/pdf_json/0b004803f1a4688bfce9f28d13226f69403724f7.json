However, age, patient expectations and medical-legal concerns were also at least somewhat important to prescribing Introduction Acute respiratory infections are a frequent cause of medically attended illness in older adults and often require hospitalization. The management of mild acute respiratory infection in the outpatient setting is clear, as most infections are due to viruses, illnesses are self-limited, and data showing the safety and benefits of withholding antibiotics are robust. [1] [2] [3] [4] Interventions to reduce unnecessary antibiotics can be focused on provider education and strategies to change behavior. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] However, physicians who provide care for patients hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are faced with more challenging decisions. Data regarding the etiology of respiratory illnesses in hospitalized adults are incomplete and current microbial diagnostic tests frequently do not allow clinicians to rule out bacterial infection with certainty. [12] [13] [14] Highlighting the problem further, we recently reported that 39% of adults hospitalized with viral infections had evidence of bacterial co-infection. [15] Thus, it is not unreasonable when faced with diagnostic uncertainty to treat with antibiotics. Professional societies have espoused an approach de-emphasizing diagnostic testing and promoting empiric antibiotic treatment for community acquired pneumonia (CAP). [12, 16] In addition, the Center for Medicaid Services (CMS) has added pressure to quickly administer antibiotics as a quality measure for patients with pneumonia leading to treatment of many patients with \"possible pneumonia\" that actually have other conditions. [17] [18] [19] The wisdom of these approaches in an era of rising rates of Clostridium difficile colitis and multi-drug resistant organisms is now being questioned. [20] [21] The use of biomarkers and definitive viral diagnostic testing may provide more accurate targeting of antibiotics to those most likely to benefit, and minimize adverse outcomes. [22] [23] [24] Procalcitonin (PCT) is a peptide precursor of calcitonin released by parenchymal cells in the presence of bacterial toxins which has been shown to be strongly associated with bacterial infections. Conversely, in patients with viral infection, PCT release is down-regulated resulting in markedly low serum levels. It was first used in patients with suspected bacterial infections or sepsis to differentiate between infectious and noninfectious causes of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Despite conflicting results on the clinical utility of PCT to reduce antibiotic exposure or predict mortality, it has been adopted into widespread practice in critical care settings and is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with suspected sepsis. [27] Recent reports from Europe suggest that serum procalcitonin (PCT) may be effectively used to safely reduce antibiotic use in LRTI by helping to differentiate between bacterial and viral respiratory illnesses and guide duration of therapy. [31, 32] A large multicenter trial, the Pro-HOSP study, randomized patients with both pneumonic and non-pneumonic LRTI to PCT guided care or standard care and demonstrated that even in patients at highest risk for complicated bacterial infections, a PCT treatment algorithm can be used to shorten antibiotic duration without harm to patients. [24] However, the FDA has not approved this use of PCT in the United States and implementing this strategy in US institutions will be impeded by both current US medical society guidelines and lack of physician experience with PCT treatment algorithms. [33] [34] [35] The latter issue is supported by Europeans reports of increased algorithm adherence in PCT experienced centers compared to PCT na\u00efve centers. [30, 33] Thus, acceptance of PCT treatment algorithms in the US will likely be an iterative process requiring larger US based clinical trials and a more measured first step assessing safety and utility in low risk patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 819, "end": 822, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 823, "end": 826, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 827, "end": 830, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 831, "end": 834, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 955, "end": 958, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 959, "end": 962, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 963, "end": 966, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 967, "end": 970, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 971, "end": 974, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 975, "end": 979, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 980, "end": 984, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1355, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1360, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1365, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1519, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1781, "end": 1785, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1786, "end": 1789, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2045, "end": 2049, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2054, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2059, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2214, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2215, "end": 2219, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2397, "end": 2401, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2402, "end": 2406, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2407, "end": 2411, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2906, "end": 2910, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2911, "end": 2915, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2916, "end": 2920, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2921, "end": 2925, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2926, "end": 2930, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2931, "end": 2935, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3243, "end": 3247, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3487, "end": 3491, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3492, "end": 3495, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3830, "end": 3834, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 4082, "end": 4086, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 4087, "end": 4091, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 4092, "end": 4096, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 4239, "end": 4243, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 4244, "end": 4247, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "We recently conducted a randomized clinical trial assessing the feasibility of combining a PCT based algorithm with rapid viral testing to guide antibiotics in patients hospitalized with non-pneumonic LRTI.

Analysis of our clinical trial data found that there was a trend towards algorithm non-adherence in subjects with higher WBC, a positive adequate sputum culture, a possible infiltrate on CXR, and an admission diagnosis of pneumonia (Table 2) , with only the latter being statistically significant. Consistent with these results, our survey identified positive adequate bacterial sputum cultures, abnormal peripheral blood counts, possible infiltrate on chest radiograph, as well as age and severity of illness as factors frequently considered by providers as \"very or somewhat important\" in deciding to override algorithm recommendations. While each of the above appear to be a reasonable factor when assessing patients for the likelihood of bacterial infection, many studies have shown that such clinical variables lack sensitivity and specificity in predicting bacterial infection. [44] [45] [46] [47] Finally, though given less weight by providers, patient expectations, medical legal issues and antibiotics started in the emergency room were all at least \"somewhat important\" considerations in decision making. Many of these issues should be at least partially amenable to educational initiatives that among other things, remind physicians of the limited clinical impact of a single dose of antibiotics given in the ER compared to other treatment measures such as hydration, oxygen and bronchodilators and their culpability in giving antibiotics to very low risk patients who subsequently develop serious antibiotic related complications.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1314, "end": 1318, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1323, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1328, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1333, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 662, "end": 671, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are several limitations in the interpretation of our results.

Ideally, the information should have been captured immediately when providers made the decision to accept or overrule the PCT algorithm for a specific patient.

Our analysis suggests that addition of viral testing to a PCT algorithm is useful, and we have identified a number of issues that may be amenable to education. Our results should assist in design of definitive US randomized clinical trials of PCT guided algorithms, as these will be most influential in clinician acceptance of biomarker based approaches for the management of respiratory infections in adults.
