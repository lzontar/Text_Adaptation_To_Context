            "text": "is a rapidly emerging respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many healthcare systems are at risk of exceeding their healthcare capacities, in particular in terms of SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalised or admitted to the ICU. Here, we study clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, require hospitalisation or intensive care. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, we perform a retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data from a cohort of 5644 patients. Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify (i) patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 67%, 81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI: 46%, 51%), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require hospitalisation with 0.92 AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). In addition, we determine which clinical features are predictive to what degree for each of the aforementioned clinical tasks. Our results indicate that predictive models trained on routinely collected clinical data could be used to predict clinical pathways for COVID-19, and therefore help inform care and prioritise resources.",

The COVID-19 pandemic challenges healthcare systems worldwide as a high peak capacity for testing and hospitalisation is necessary to diagnose and treat affected patients, particularly if the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is not mitigated. To avoid exceeding the available healthcare capacities, many countries have adopted social distancing policies, imposed travel restrictions, and postponed non-essential care and surgeries in order to reduce peak demand on their healthcare systems [2] , [3] , [4] . We study the use of predictive models (light purple) to estimate whether patients are likely (i) to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, and whether SARS-CoV-2 positive patients are likely (ii) to be admitted to the hospital and (iii) to require critical care based on clinical, demographic and blood analysis data. Accurate clinical predictive models stratify patients according to individual risk, and, in this manner, help prioritise healthcare resources, such as testing, hospital and critical care capacity.",

            "text": "A substantial body of work is dedicated to the study, validation and implementation of predictive models for clinical tasks. Clinical predictive models have, for example, been used to predict risk of septic shock [7] , [8] , risk of heart failure [9] , readmission following heart failure [10] , [11] , [12] , false alarms in critical care [13] , risk scores [14] , outcomes [15] and mortality in pneumonia [16] , [17] , and mortality risk in critical care [18] , [19] , [20] . Predicting clinical outcomes for individual patients is difficult because a large number of confounding factors may influence patient outcomes, and collecting and accounting for these factors in an unbiased way remains an open challenge in clinical practice [21] . Systematic studies, such as the one presented in this work, enable medical practitioners to better understand, assess and potentially overcome these issues by systematically evaluating generalisation ability, expected predictive performance, and influential predictors of various clinical predictive models. Beyond the need for systematic evaluation, missingness [22] , [23] , [24] , [25] , noise [26] , [27] , multivariate input data [13] , [28] , [29] , [30] , and the need for interpretability [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] have been highlighted as particularly important considerations in healthcare settings. In this work, we build on recent methodological advances to develop and systematically study clinical predictive models that may aid in prioritising healthcare resources [35] for COVID-19, and thereby help prevent a potential overextension of healthcare system capacity.",

To evaluate the generalisation ability of the developed clinical predictive models and to rule out overfitting to patients in the evaluation cohort, the development data is initially split into independent and stratified training, validation, and test folds without any patient overlap. Concretely, the multistage pipeline consists of (i) preprocessing, (ii) model development, (iii) model selection, and (iv) model evaluation stages. For preprocessing and model development, only the training fold is used, and only the validation and test folds of the development data are used for model selection and model evaluation, respectively.

This removes a total of 9 features from the original 106 routine clinical, laboratory and demographic features. We then transform all discrete features for each patient into their one-hot encoded representation with one out of p indicator variables set to 1 to indicate the discrete value for this patient, and all others set to 0 with p being the number of unique values for the discrete feature. We defined those features as discrete that have fewer than 6 unique values across all patients in the training fold. For discrete features, missing features were counted as a separate category in the one hot representation. Next, we standardised all continuous features to have zero mean and unit standard deviation across the training fold data. Lastly, we performed multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) to impute all missing values of every continuous feature from the respective other features in an iterative fashion [50] . We additionally added a missing indicator that indicates 1 if the feature was imputed by MICE and 0 if it was originally present in order to preserve missingness information in the data after imputation. After the preprocessing stage, continuous input features are standardised and fully imputed, and discrete input features are one-hot encoded. All preprocessing operations are derived only from the training fold, and na\u00efvely applied without adjustment to validation and test folds in order to avoid information leakage. 4) Model Development: In the model development stage, we train candidate clinical predictive modelsf SARS-CoV-2 ,f admission andf ICU using supervised learning on the training fold of the preprocessed data. To derive the models from the preprocessed training fold data, we optimise various types of predictive models, and perform a hyperparameter search with m runs for each of them.

Most notably, we found that 71.7% of the importance for the best XGB model for predicting SARS-CoV-2 test results was assigned to the missing indicator corresponding to the Arterial Lactic Acid measurement, i.e. much of the marginal predictive performance gain of the XGB model was attributed to whether or not the Arterial Lactic Acid test had been ordered. Beyond Arterial Lactic Acid being missing, age, leukocyte count, platelet count, and creatinine were implied to be associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result by the best encountered predictive model, which further substantiates recent independent reports of those factors being potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 [59] , [60] , [61] , [62] , [48] . Similarly to the best encountered XGB model for predicting SARS-CoV-2 test results, the top encountered predictive models for hospital admission and ICU admission for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients assigned a considerable degree of importance to missingness patterns associated with a number of measurements. A possible explanation for missingness appearing as a top predictor across the different tasks is that decisions whether or not to order a certain test to be performed for a given patient were influenced by patient characteristics that were not captured in the set of clinical measurements that were available to the predictive models. A controlled setting with standardised testing guidelines would be required to determine which confounding factors are behind the predictive power of the missingness patterns that have been implied to be associated with COVID-19 by the predictive models. Beyond missingness patterns, top predictors for predicting hospital admission were lactate dehydrogenase [63] , gammaglutamyltransferase, which through abnormal liver function has been reported to be implicated in COVID-19 severity [64] , and HCO 3 [65] . For predicting ICU admission in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, pCO 2 and pH [48] were top predictors. Blood pH, and in particular respiratory alkalosis, has been reported to be associated with severe COVID-19 [66] .",

Models that predict SARS-CoV-2 test results could help prioritise scarce testing capacity by identifying those individuals that are more likely to receive a positive result. Similarly, predictive models that predict which SARS-CoV-2 positive patients would be most likely to require hospital and critical care beds could help better utilise existing hospital capacity by prioritising those patients that have the highest risk of deterioration. Facilitating the efficient utilisation of scarce healthcare resources is particularly important in dealing with SARS-CoV-2 as its rapid transmission significantly increases demand for healthcare services worldwide. The main limitation of the presented study is that its experimental evaluation was based on data collected from a single study site, and its results may therefore not generalise to settings with significantly different patient populations, admission criteria, patterns of missingness, and testing guidelines. In addition, we did not have access to mortality data for the analysed cohort, and we were therefore not able to correlate our predicted individual risk scores with patient mortality, which is another related prediction task that may be of clinical importance. Future studies should include a broader set of clinical measurements and outcomes, cohorts from multiple distinct geographical sites and under varying patterns of missingness in order to determine the robustness of the clinical predictive models to these confounding factors. Finally, we believe that the inclusion of data from other modalities, such as genomic profiling and medical imaging, and data on co-morbidities, symptoms and treatment histories could potentially further improve predictive performance of clinical predictive models across the presented prediction tasks.",

We evaluated our developed clinical predictive models in a retrospective evaluation using a cohort of 5644 hospital patients seen in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. In addition, we determined the clinical, demographic and blood analysis measurements that were most important for accurately predicting SARS-CoV-2 status, hospital admissions, and ICU admissions. Our experimental results indicate that clinical predictive models may in the future potentially be used to inform care and help prioritise scarce healthcare resources by assigning personalised risk scores for individual patients using routinely collected clinical, demographic and blood analysis data. Furthermore, our findings on the importance of routine clinical measurements towards predicting clinical pathways for patients increase our understanding of the interrelations of individual risk profiles and outcomes in SARS-CoV-2. Based on our study's results, we conclude that healthcare systems should explore the use of predictive models that assess individual COVID-19 risk in order to improve healthcare resource prioritisation and inform patient care.",
