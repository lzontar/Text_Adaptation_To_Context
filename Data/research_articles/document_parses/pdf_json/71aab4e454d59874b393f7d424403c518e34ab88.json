Immunologists and epidemiologists will investigate the role played by the absence of immunity towards this new viral strain, its speed of transmission, the multiple patterns of the disease, which makes it hard to recognize and isolate oligosymptomatic cases, the clinical course of the infection, mainly in the elderly, in making the COVID-19 pandemia an unprecedented one in the recent times [15, 18] . Did anything similar happen during the colonization of the New World after 1492, when Native Americans had no immunity to many of the deadly diseases brought there?",
