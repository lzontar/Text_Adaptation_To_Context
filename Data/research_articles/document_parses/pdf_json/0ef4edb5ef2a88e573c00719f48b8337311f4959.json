The unexpected spread of a scarcely known virus was accompanied by initial confusion and disorganization. 12 By recalling our memories and reading the emails and text messages of the past 2 months, we identified two different periods from different factors, setting March 22, 2020 as the turning point. During the first month (from 24th of February to 22nd of March), no protection was recommended during examinations of apparently healthy people, thus asymptomatic carriers were not taken into consideration as possible transmission vehicles. However, since SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through droplets, 13 progressive evidence that Otolaryngologists are at particularly high risk even when performing routine clinical procedures has suggested to use surgical masks as individual protection. At that time, surgical procedures continued to be performed wearing standard medical masks, leaving viral-filtering-PPE available for use only in case of confirmed COVID-19 patients. However, around the globe the shortage of PPE, along with the lack of clear recommendations about their correct use, have contributed to increased infections among otorhinolaryngologists. In fact, it is noticeable that the first physician who died of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, on January 25, 2020 was an ENT surgeon, but the fact was only reported globally on March 20, 2020. 14 More or less at the same time, Patel et al published a letter, which was diffused through emails and websites, about the first case of COVID-19 transmission during an endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Wuhan, that resulted in cross contamination of 14 health care workers, emphasizing the high potential for hospital-acquired viral infections. 6, 15 This has generated reluctance to perform endonasal endoscopic procedures worldwide. Preliminary data emerging from international laboratory and clinical experiences show that surgical procedures involving the airways, or using them as a surgical corridor, such as transnasal skull base surgery, must be prudentially considered high-risk procedures, at least until further evidence becomes available. 6, [16] [17] [18] The concurrent publication of recommendations by the Italian Society of Otorhinolaryngology, 19 the European Rhinologic Society, 20 and ENT UK 21 as well as the Italian Skull Base Society 5 led us from 23rd of March, to elevate the standard of protection for health care providers during sinus and skull base procedures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 173, "end": 175, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 670, "end": 672, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1777, "end": 1779, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1780, "end": 1782, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2183, "end": 2185, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2186, "end": 2190, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2191, "end": 2195, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2196, "end": 2200, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2294, "end": 2296, "text": "19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2330, "end": 2332, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper reporting the largest case series of patients operated for urgent and emergent sinus and skull base pathologies during the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care referral center.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "A considerable reduction was observed during the COVID-19 outbreak, as high as \u221260.7%.
