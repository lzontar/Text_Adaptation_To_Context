Hairpins that are hot spots for recombination in the genomic RNA of turnip crinkle virus (TCV) and satellite (sat)-RNA C, a parasitic RNA associated with TCV infections, stimulate RNA synthesis 10-fold from a downstream promoter sequence in an in vitro assay using partially purified TCV RdRp. Artificial hairpins had an inhibitory effect on transcription. RNA accumulation in single cells was enhanced 5-to 10-fold when the natural stem-loop structures were inserted into a poorly accumulating sat-RNA. The effect of the stem-loop structures on RNA replication was additive, with insertion of three stem-loop RNA elements increasing sat-RNA accumulation to the greatest extent (25-fold). These stem-loop structures do not influence the stability of the RNAs in vivo, but may serve to recruit the RdRp to the template.",

Despite vast differences in virion morphology, host ranges, symptoms, and organization and expression of genomic RNAs, positivestranded RNA viruses show striking similarities in replication strategies such as the amino acid sequences of virus-encoded replicases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Positive-stranded RNA viruses replicate efficiently in infected cells by a two-step process mediated by the viral RdRp. First, a complementary RNA strand is made from the invading positive-strand RNA template. Secondly, the new complementary (minus) strand serves as a template to produce large quantities of progeny positive-strand RNAs. The replication process is usually asymmetric, leading to a 20-to 100-fold excess of positive strands over minus strands. Despite the importance of RNA replication in the viral life cycle and pathogenesis, biochemical studies on the process of viral replication are still in their earliest stages.",

The best known cis-acting elements are the viral replication and transcription promoters that are required for initiation of RNA synthesis by specific RdRps. Replication and transcription promoters have been characterized for many viruses including bacterial, fungal, animal and plant viruses (reviewed by de Graaff and Jaspars, 1994; Buck, 1996) . Promoter sequences/structures for these viruses contain either poly(A) tails, pseudoknots, tRNA-like structures, stem-loop structures or short primary sequences without high-order structures. Another characteristic feature of most viral RdRps is the ability to initiate RNA synthesis de novo (i.e. without the need for an RNA primer). Therefore, transcription promoters must have at least two functions: (i) to recruit (bind to) the RdRp; and (ii) to promote complementary RNA synthesis from the initiating nucleotide.",

It has a small genome (4 kb) with five genes, of which two are required for replication. In addition, TCV infections are associated with several small parasitic RNAs, such as defective interfering RNAs (Li et al., 1989) and satellite (sat)-RNAs (Simon and Howell, 1986) . sat-RNA D is the smallest sat-RNA at 194 nucleotides (nt) and shares little contiguous sequence similarity with the TCV genomic RNA ( Figure 1 ). An unusual TCV sat-RNA is sat-RNA C, which is formed naturally by recombination between sat-RNA D and two short non-adjacent regions in the 3\u0408 region of the TCV genomic RNA (Figure 1 ). sat-RNAs provide excellent models for studies on replication, recombination and symptom production due to their small size, lack of open reading frames and plasticity. In vitro and in vivo analyses of sequences required for minus-strand synthesis of sat-RNA C revealed that the promoter is contained within the 3\u0408-terminal 29 bases of the plus strand (see Figure 1 ; Song and Simon, 1995; Stupina and Simon, 1997; Carpenter and Simon, 1998) . Two separate sequences have been identified in sat-RNA C minus strands that are able to function as independent promoters in vitro (Guan et al., 1997) . The 3\u0408-proximal element is located 11 bases from the 3\u0408 end of the minus strand; a second sequence is located 41 bases from the 5\u0408 end (see Figure 1 ; Guan et al., 1997) .",

In addition, deletion of the motif1-hairpin from sat-RNA C reduced its accumulation by \u03fe10-fold in protoplasts of the host plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Insertion of the above hairpins into a poorly replicating sat-RNA molecule demonstrated that RNA replication is stimulated by both the motif1-and motif3hairpins without significantly affecting the stability of the corresponding RNAs in single-cell plant protoplasts. The motif1-hairpin is shown to function in both forward and reverse orientation and its activity is not strictly positiondependent.

If the hairpins are involved in recruitment of the RdRp and/or other replication factors, then these hairpins may also play cis-acting roles in the replication of sat-RNA C and TCV. In support of this model, extensive deletions within the motif3-hairpin rendered TCV non-infectious in protoplasts and whole turnip plants (Carpenter et al., 1995) . However, the latter study did not exclude the possibilities that deletions in the 3\u0408 non-coding region of TCV altered its translatability or stability in vivo.",

The results shown in Figure 3A indicate that the two sat-RNAs have similar stabilities in the absence of replication. To exclude the possibility that the remaining undegraded sat-RNAs 5655 survived in the culture media and not inside the protoplasts (the degradation rate may be different inside versus outside the cells), polyethylene glycol (PEG) was omitted during the inoculation step in a control experiment. Omission of PEG resulted in undetectable levels of both sat-RNAs at all time points except the 0 h time point (data not shown). Therefore, the levels of sat-RNAs shown in Figure 3A (between 2 and 12 h.p.i.) reflect undegraded RNAs inside the cells. Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that the in vivo survival rates (stability) of wt sat-RNA C and \u2206mot1 are similar in the absence of replication. Therefore, the motif1-hairpin does not play a major role in RNA stabilization, but rather may be directly involved in RNA replication.",

These results indicate an additive effect of the hairpins when present in sat-RNA CX. None of the constructs showed increased stability when compared with sat-RNA CX in protoplasts in the absence of the TCV helper virus (data not shown).

Putative binding of the TCV RdRp to the minusstranded motif1-hairpin (Nagy et al., 1998) , and the enhancement of sat-RNA replication by the motif1-and motif3-hairpins in protoplasts (see above), suggest that these hairpins may act as general transcription enhancers in the replication of sat-RNAs and TCV, respectively. This, however, cannot be tested in vitro using full-length sat-RNA templates, since the partially purified TCV RdRp preparation prefers 3\u0408-terminal extension (self-priming) over de novo initiation for full-length constructs (Song and Simon, 1994; P.D.Nagy and A.E.Simon, unpublished results) . To circumvent this problem, short RNA templates were constructed that direct efficient de novo initiation of RNA synthesis. All these RNA templates contain a core linear plus-strand initiation promoter from sat-RNA C minus strands (12 nt; Guan et al., 1997) at the 3\u0408 end and sequences of interest at the 5\u0408 end ( Figure 7A ). Minusstrand sequences representing a promoter for plus-strand synthesis and the motif1-hairpin in the minus-strand orientation were chosen for these studies, since previous results on recombination (Cascone et al., 1993; Nagy and Simon, 1998a; Nagy et al., 1998) and kinetic studies on sat-RNA C accumulation (see Figure 3B ) indicate a more 5658 significant role for the motif1-hairpin present on minusstrand sat-RNA C.",

Stimulative effect of the motif1-hairpin and motif3-hairpin on plus-strand RNA synthesis in vitro. (A) Schematic representation of RNA constructs used. Sequences and predicted structures are shown in the 3\u0408 to 5\u0408 orientation since they include a minimal plus-strand initiation promoter derived from sat-RNA C minus strands (Guan et al., 1997) . The linear 12 nt promoter sequence is boxed. The relative normalized activities of constructs, which were based on analysis of denaturing PAGE, followed by autoradiography and densitometry, are shown to the right of each construct. The data were normalized based on the number of template-directed radioactive UTP incorporated and the molar amounts of templates used. ND, not determined [due to aberrant RdRp reaction, such as premature termination, see (B)]. (B) A representative denaturing gel of radiolabeled RNA products synthesized by in vitro transcription with TCV RdRp. M, single-stranded RNA marker (in bases). Templatesized products are denoted by black asterisks. RNAs that migrate aberrantly (much faster than the template-sized RNAs in denaturing gels) are indicated by white asterisks. hairpin is active in both orientations, activity is greater when present in the minus-sense orientation (Nagy and Simon, 1998;  Figure 4) . Construct mutmot1\u03e9pr contains a hairpin similar to the motif1-hairpin in minus-strand orientation, except that the normal six-member loop is replaced by a tetraloop and a deletion of two bases results in a symmetrical internal loop. This construct supported complementary RNA synthesis at a level 2-fold higher than that of Control1\u03e9pr RNA ( Figure 7B ). The third construct (GC\u03e9pr) contains an unusually stable hairpin with 10 G-C base pairs and a UCGG tetraloop. This construct supported RNA synthesis at levels lower than the Control1\u03e9pr template ( Figure 7B ). In addition, the RNA products were S1 nuclease-resistant (not shown), but shorter than template-sized. While it is possible that the smaller than expected products were due to premature termination, full-length products were synthesized from a template containing a different promoter sequence and the same GC hairpin (P.D. Nagy and A.E.Simon, unpublished results) . The fourth construct (AU\u03e9pr; Figure 7A ) has a stem-loop structure with 10 A-U pairs, which is stabilized by a UCGG tetraloop. This construct also produced a lower level of products than the control construct with no hairpin. Although the products were shorter than template-sized, as with the GC hairpin construct, full-sized products were obtained using a different promoter (P.D.Nagy and A.E. Simon, unpublished results) . Since the exact size of the products could not be determined due to the aberrant migration of RNAs with high AU or GC contents on PAGE-urea gels, the level of RNA synthesis could not be measured accurately for these constructs. Nevertheless, the very low amounts of radiolabeled products that were detectable for these constructs suggest that the GC and AU hairpins had an inhibitory effect on transcription ( Figure 7B ). Construct ministem\u03e9pr, which contains only three G-C pairs with the UCGG tetraloop ( Figure 7A ), was also less active than Control1\u03e9pr RNA ( Figure 7B ). Altogether, these experiments demonstrate (i) that the motif1-hairpin in either orientation and the motif3-hairpin are able to stimulate RNA synthesis from a downstream promoter, and (ii) that artificial hairpins inhibit transcription from the same promoter.",

To test whether the motif1-hairpin can stimulate RNA synthesis that starts from 3\u0408-located singlestranded CCC or CC sites (in the absence of known TCV promoters), construct CCA4\u03e9Mot1 with four possible start sites was generated and tested for activity in vitro ( Figure 8A ). Three S1-resistant RNA products were obtained ( Figure 8B ) that correspond to initiation at three out of the four possible CC or CCC sites based on the size of the products, as indicated schematically in Figure 8A . A control construct that carried the same four possible start sites at the 3\u0408 terminus that are present in CCA4\u03e9Mot1, plus a short 5\u0408 flanking sequence, did not direct detectable RNA synthesis (construct CCA4\u03e9Mot1short; Figure 8B ). The second control construct was Control1-pr that contains the wt sat-RNA C promoter for minus-strand synthesis along with the natural CCC start site ( Figure 8A ). This RNA directed the synthesis of a single complementary RNA product that was present in a 4-fold higher amount than the combined amounts of products obtained with CCA4\u03e9Mot1. Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that the motif1-hairpin can function like a promoter if there are single-stranded initiating sequences 3\u0408 of the hairpin.",

That these hairpins can also affect sat-RNA replication is supported by the 5-to 10-fold higher levels of sat-RNA CX accumulation in protoplasts when these elements are present ( Figure 6 ). In addition, deletion of the motif1hairpin in sat-RNA C reduces its accumulation by \u03fe10fold in protoplasts (Figures 2 and 3) , while deletion of large portions of the motif3-hairpin in TCV makes the RNA non-viable in turnip plants and reduces its accumulation to non-detectable levels in protoplasts (Carpenter et al., 1995) . Since accumulation in protoplasts is also a function of the stability of the templates, the possibility existed that the hairpins helped stabilize the sat-RNAs. However, the rate of RNA degradation of the input RNAs that carried or lacked the motif1-hairpin was similar in the absence of the TCV helper virus, suggesting that the hairpins are involved in enhancing replication and not stability ( Figure 3A ; data not shown). However, because the intercellular location of sat-RNA C may differ in cells containing TCV RdRp and in cells with no replicase present, we cannot exclude the possibility that the motif1hairpin plays a role in RNA stabilization by influencing template selection during replication. A cis-acting element for brome mosaic virus (BMV) was demonstrated to increase RNA stability only in the presence of the 1a protein (Sullivan and Ahlquist, 1999) .",

Both hairpins enhanced transcription from a TCV RdRp promoter sequence by~10-fold. The elevated level of RdRp products obtained in vitro in the presence of these hairpins can result from either an increased rate of initiation of RNA synthesis, increased processivity of the RdRp, increased rate of termination of RNA synthesis followed by reuse of released RdRps or a combination of these processes. Our data also suggest that the motif1-hairpin plays a strand-specific role in RNA replication. The coupled nature of plus-and minusstrand synthesis in RNA viruses, however, complicates the analysis, since a decreased level of newly synthesized plus strands will also reduce the level of minus strands in subsequent rounds of replication. Nevertheless, minusstrand levels decreased by 2-fold, while plus-strand levels decreased by 6-fold in the absence of the motif1-hairpin at 12 h.p.i. (Figure 3 ). This can be explained if the motif1hairpin functions to a greater extent when present on the minus strands (i.e. during plus-strand synthesis) than on the plus strands. This model is supported by the in vitro data; the motif1-hairpin in minus-strand orientation was 40% more effective than in plus-strand orientation ( Figure 7A ). In addition, when combined with the promoter at the 3\u0408 end of sat-RNA C plus strands, the motif1hairpin only enhanced transcription by 2-fold (P.D. Nagy and A.E.Simon, manuscript in preparation) , much less than the 10-fold enhancement achieved using the sat-RNA C minus-strand promoter sequence (Figure 7) .",

Portions of the motif3-hairpin sequence (minusstrand orientation) and its 3\u0408 flanking region are also similar to the minus-strand subgenomic RNA promoters (Cascone et al., 1990; Zhang et al., 1991) . The sequence similarities between the motif1-and motif3-hairpins and known replication promoters for the TCV RdRp suggest that these cis-acting elements may have similar functions, such as binding to the TCV RdRp. Based on the sequence described above and structural similarities between TCV RdRp promoters and the motif1and motif3-hairpins, the question remains as to why the motif1-hairpin can direct complementary RNA synthesis efficiently using a primer in a 3\u0408-terminal extension reaction in vitro, while, by itself, the motif1-hairpin can not support de novo initiation (Nagy et al., 1998 ; similar studies have not been conducted for the motif3-hairpin). One possibility is that TCV promoters are composed of two, not necessarily contiguous, components: (i) a hairpin enhancer that recruits the RdRp and/or other replication factors; and (ii) linear sequences, termed initiator sequences, which are used by the RdRp to initiate complementary RNA synthesis in a primer-independent manner. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the motif1-hairpin can direct de novo synthesis when singlestranded sequences similar to initiator sequences (i.e. sequences located at the start site for transcription) such as CCC and CC are placed 3\u0408 of the hairpin ( Figure 8B ). The role of the hairpin as an attractor for the viral RdRp is supported by previous studies indicating that additional copies of the motif1-hairpin inhibited 3\u0408-terminal extension by the TCV RdRp in vitro to a greater extent than other sequences. The modular nature of promoters may be advantageous for RNA viruses, since they can quickly delete or duplicate these cis-acting sequences in order to increase their competitiveness or adapt better to their hosts.",

For example, animal and human coronaviruses (Hsue and Masters, 1997) and their associated defective interfering RNAs (Kim et al., 1993) contain cis-acting sequences from both internal and 3\u0408-proximal regions of the genomic RNA. Animal alphaviruses have a conserved 51 nt sequence within the coding region (P123/4ORF) that is important in virus and defective interfering RNA accumulation (Niesters and Strauss, 1990) . In addition, a 3\u0408-proximal sequence in the P1 capsid gene of human rhinovirus 14 RNA is required for efficient RNA replication (McKnight and Lemon, 1996) . A similar element may exist within the P2-P3 region of poliovirus (McKnight and Lemon, 1996) . Flock house virus (Ball and Li, 1993) , BMV (French and Ahlquist, 1988 ) and hepatitis delta virus also contain internal cis-acting sequences. For BMV, a 150-ntlong sequence in the central portion of the RNA3 genome segment influences the extent of asymmetry in RNA replication (the ratio of plus versus minus strands). In addition, the same region has been proposed to facilitate the assembly of the replicase components into a functional RdRp complex (Quadt et al., 1995) . Further studies are needed to determine whether these viruses also have modular promoters similar to TCV-associated RNAs.",

            "text": "In addition to the role in RNA replication discussed above, RNA replication enhancers play a central role in RNA recombination, virus evolution and adaptation in the TCV system and possibly in other virus systems as well. The RNA replication enhancers may promote RNA recombination directly by constituting recombination hot spots through binding of the replicase-aborted nascent strand complex during the crossover event Nagy et al., 1998) . Thus, it is possible that RNA replication enhancers are central elements used to reassemble functional viral 'modules' around cis-acting elements in genomes, as predicted by the theory of the modular evolution of viruses (Gibbs, 1987; Goldbach et al., 1991; Dolja and Carrington, 1992) . Accordingly, non-viable sat-RNA C mutants can frequently generate viable (i.e. repaired) sat-RNAs through recombination between sat-RNA D and the mutated sat-RNA C with the help of the motif1-hairpin replication enhancer (Cascone et al., 1993) . In addition, many novel recombinants are generated between sat-RNA D and TCV around the motif3/hairpin4 RNA replication enhancer (Carpenter et al., 1995) . In addition to TCV, cis-acting elements may play a role in RNA recombination in other viral systems as well. For example, some of the junction sites in flock house virus, an animal nodavirus, resemble a replication origin located at the extreme 3\u0408 terminus of RNA2 (Ball, 1997) . The similarity between the junction site sequences and the 3\u0408 replication origin suggests that internal sequences may guide the polymerase during template switching (Ball, 1997) . Also, subgenomic RNA promoters or related sequences are frequently found as recombination sites in BMV (Allison et al., 1990) , Sindbis virus (Weiss and Schlesinger, 1991) , tobacco mosaic virus (Beck and Dawson, 1990), citrus tristeza virus (Bar-Joseph et al., 1997) and TCV (C.D. Carpenter and A.E.Simon, unpublished results) . These internal cis-acting sequences may have played a role in recombination events by recruiting the RdRp-nascent strand complex.",

Owing to the presence of the novel RNA replication enhancer, sat-RNA C was able to become the most competitive and successful subviral RNA in the TCV system. The formation of sat-RNA C demonstrates that novel cis-acting sequences can be generated during recombination events. This, in turn, gives support to the significance of studying RNA replication enhancers that may confer a 'competitive edge' to viruses and subviral pathogens.",
