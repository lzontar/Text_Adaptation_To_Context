Results from second approach involving SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome identified a set of virus encoded miRNAs which might regulate host signaling pathways. Our analysis further identified a similar \"GA\" rich motif in SARS-CoV-2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe SARS infections. Hence, we successfully identified human and virus encoded miRNAs that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host miRNAs could target SARS-CoV-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals. We identified non-coding sequences in SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards SARS pathology. The study provides insights into the overlapping sequences among these viruses for their effective inhibition as well as identifying new drug targets that could be used for development of new antivirals.",

SARS reference genome was used for comparison and the analysis was performed on both the forward and reverse sequences of viral genomes. For prediction of host miRNAs that could bind to viral genomes, miRDB algorithm was used [7] [8] . The analysis was performed in custom mode where user defined sequences can be uploaded and processed. All the analysis were done at default settings and only those miRNAs were studied further that had a target score >= 80. Using this approach, around 263 and 196 host miRNAs were identified that could target each of the forward were significantly higher as compared to number of miRNAs targeting SARS reference genome.",

Hence, in order to gain insights into various miRNAs encoded by genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses, a set of computational tools were used to predict miRNAs encoded by these viruses. Since hairpin loops forms the precursor of small RNAs, miRNAFold algorithm was used first to predict loops in viral genomes [9, 10] . The algorithm predicted around 574 and 550 hairpin loops in each SARS-CoV-2 forward and reverse genomes respectively, 573 and 575 hairpin loops in SARS forward and reverse genome respectively. Since all hairpin loops does not result in functional miRNAs, miRBoost algorithm was then used to identify whether the hairpin structures could yield functional microRNA or not [11] . The algorithm successfully predicted around 66 miRNAs in each of SARS-CoV-2 forward genome, 64 miRNAs in each of SARS-CoV-2 reverse genome, 89 miRNAs in SARS forward genome and 79 miRNAs in SARS reverse genome. Using the above mentioned algorithms we successfully identified some of the potential viral encoded miRNAs which can be used by the viruses to modulate host signaling pathways. Then we utilized mirBase algorithm to study whether our predicted miRNAs had any similarity to human encoded miRNAs or not [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Interestingly, we observed that out of 65 sequences that were predicted by miRBoost, mirBase identified 56 miRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 forward genome sequence that matched to human specific miRNAs. Similarly out of 64 miRNAs predicted in SARS-CoV-2 reverse genome, 39 matched to human specific miRNAs. The algorithm further matched 66 and 33 miRNAs to humans from a repertoire of 89 and 79 predicted miRNAs among forward and reverse SARS genomes (fig 1d, Supplementary sheet 4) . We then compared all the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS for identification of any common virus encoded miRNA.",
