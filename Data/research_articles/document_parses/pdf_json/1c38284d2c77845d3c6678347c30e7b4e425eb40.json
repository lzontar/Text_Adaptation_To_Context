The editorial by Brodin suggests some possible mechanisms why it is so (1). I would like to emphasize the significance of cross immunity due to previous exposure to seasonal coronavirus; it may be a plausible explanation for why children appear to be protected (2, 3) .",

One of the four seasonal coronaviruses, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), also uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor. In a recent study published in March 2020 it was found that convalescent serum from patients who survived SARS could neutralize binding of the sars-CoV-2 to ACE2, thus blocking the uptake of sars-CoV-2 into the cells (3). This suggests",
