Materials and methods This was a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in 304 inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM) subjects with two oral antidiabetic drugs (glimepiride 4 mg and metformin 500 mg) were randomised to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg once daily (OD) or placebo. Dose of hydroxychloroquine was selected as per body weight of the subject. Primary end point was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change at week 12 from baseline. Secondary endpoint was change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post prandial plasma glucose (PPG), body weight and any adverse reaction including no of hypoglycemic events, as well as a change in the percentage of subjects with A1C < 7.0% and > 6.5% after 12 weeks of treatment.. In follow-up of 400 mg once daily was once again divided to 200 mg twice daily (BD) to study the effect on tolerability profile for further 12 weeks. Results Hydroxychloroquine was associated with significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline (7-8.5%) in 12 weeks \u22120.78%, \u22120.91% and 1.2% for hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg OD, respectively, versus 0.13% with placebo (P < 0.005). FPG and PPG were reduced by \u221225 to \u221238 mg/dl and 34-53 mg/dl, respectively. Body weight also reduced in each group of HCQ. Hypoglycemia was reported only with 300 mg (1.2%) and 400 mg (2.1%) group of HCQ. It was observed that patients who complains with mild GI disturbance with HCQ 400 mg glycemic efficacy was maintained with 200 mg BD with significant relief of the symptoms. Conclusion Hydroxychloroquine added to sulphonylurea and metformin, improves glycemic control significantly in T2DM patients. Glycemic effect of different dose of hydroxychloroquine is dose dependent. The safety/tolerability profile of hydroxychloroquine was favourable except GI disturbance which is more frequent with 400 mg.

Similarly, the role of hydroxychloroquine has been already established to control CVD like MI in high risk individuals such as RA patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Cardiac safety studies, particularly the electrophysiological implications for HCQ, have predominantly been evaluated on the basis of its use as an antimalarial treatment and prophylactic. When looking to repurpose hydroxychloroquine for managing diabetes patients, it is essential that the presence or absence of QT interval prolongation in patients are taken into consideration [31] . A retrospective study (from January 1, 2001-October 31, 2013, excluding patients with CVD prior to RA diagnosis) done by Sharma TS et al., confirms that hydroxychloroquine use was associated with a 72% decrease in the risk of incident CVD in RA patients [32] . The authors also commented that the biological plausibility of this protective association is supported by the favourable associations of hydroxychloroquine with glucose and lipids in RA patients and with thrombosis in lupus patients and nonrheumatic patients [32] . A retrospective study recently published has also confirmed the cardiac safety of hydroxychloroquine [33] . In this study researcher evaluated effect of hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine (HCQ/ CQ) on TdP/QT using data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (> 13 million total report analysed incorporating extensive safety data of last 50 rears, 1969-2019) . Lower 95% Cls for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death or accident/injuries or depression [PRRs and 95% Cls for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29-2.59)] [33] . As a cardio vascular safety hydroxychloroquine also has been associated with beneficial changes in lipid profiles, including decrease in low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, which result in a less atherogenic lipid profile [34] [35] [36] . Even prior to the advances in current antithrombotic therapies, hydroxychloroquine was used perioperatively for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in abdominal and orthopaedic surgeries [37] [38] [39] . Studies had already confirmed that hydroxychloroquine use was associated with reduced risk of thrombotic events in patients with lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome [40] . Even it had been found that hydroxychloroquine acts as a bradycardic agent in SAN cells, in atrial preparations and in vivo and lows the rate of spontaneous action potential firing in the SAN through multichannel inhibition, including that of I f [41] .
