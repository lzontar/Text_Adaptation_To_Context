Methods One hundred and forty-six patients who underwent esophagectomy between 1995 and 2011 for stage II and III cancer were selected and separated into open esophagectomy (Open) and MIE groups. Risk adjustment was performed using the CCI-G. The outcomes of interest were operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), lymph node harvest, length of hospital stay (LOS), major complications, 30-day mortality, and overall survival. Results Sixty-four patients (44 %) underwent Open while 71 (49 %) had MIE. An additional (7 %) were converted and classified with MIE. There was no significant difference between MIE and Open in terms of operative time. MIE had less EBL (mean difference = 234 mL, p \\ 0.001), higher lymph node harvest (mean = 7.4 nodes, p \\ 0.001), and shorter LOS (median = 1.5 days,", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "p = 0.02). Atrial arrhythmias were the most frequent complication, occurring in 33 % of patients in both the MIE and the Open group (p = 0.988). Thirty-day mortality was 2 % for MIE and 5 % for Open (p = 0.459). Five-year survival was 41 % for MIE and 33 % for Open (p = 0.513). Operative approach, age, gender, BMI, clinical stage, and neoadjuvant therapy did not have any significant effect on the outcomes or overall survival. CCI-G influenced outcomes with operative time, LOS, cardiovascular complication, and anastomotic leak rate, favoring CCI-G 0 compared to CCI-G 3. Overall survival was worse for CCI-G 1 in comparison with CCI-G 0 [hazard ratio (HR) 1.99, p = 0.027].

When considering intraoperative and postoperative variables, the surgical approach was significantly different between the two groups. Eighty-three percent of the patients in the MIE group underwent a three-field approach and 88 % of the patients in the Open group underwent an Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (p \\ 0.001, Table 3 ).

In the only randomized controlled trial to date that evaluated Open versus MIE [29] , the pulmonary infection rate was 34 %, which is considerably more than that seen in this study. In a previous report, our group found a 34 % complication rate in MIE patients and 27 % in open cases [30] . It is interesting to note that only 5 % of patients in the Open group and 4 % in the MIE group had a CCI-G of 3 (advanced) while 50 % of the Open group and 65 % of the MIE group were graded as having low-grade or intermediate morbidity ( Table 1 ). The low frequency of advanced Charlson grades in our study cohort may reflect selection bias. Individuals with advanced-grade morbidities are usually either not referred for surgery or are declined surgery due to a ''high'' risk of complications or death. The second observation suggests that even patients with no or low comorbidity scores (CCI-G 0, CCI-G 1) are at risk for major complications after either open or laparoscopic esophagectomy. It appears that only CGI-G 3 is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular complications (OR 10.1; 95 % CI, 1.36-209.04, p = 0.048) and anastomotic leak (OR 8.9; 95 % CI, 1.20-70.90, p = 0.03).

Obesity also adds to the length of the procedure. Our mortality rate of 2 % in the MIE group and 5 % in the Open group is in keeping with the rates published by others [6, 7, 31] . While it is not particularly surprising that comorbidities have an influence on postoperative complications, a new finding of this study is that patient comorbidities are an independent risk factor for longer-term survival.

A retrospective review of 432 patients who underwent esophagectomy identified poor general status and poor cardiac, hepatic, and respiratory function as independent predictors of a fatal postoperative course [33] . The authors used these findings to build a composite risk score for postoperative mortality, but this instrument did not assess the impact of these comorbid diseases on longterm cancer survival.

Like others, we have found that MIE is associated with less operative blood loss [8, 12, 29, 33] , a higher lymph node harvest [12, 13, 33] , shorter LOS [9] , and equivalent short-and long-term survival rates [9, 12, 13] . However, there was a noted difference in our surgical approach between the two groups. The majority of our MIE patients underwent a three-field approach while the majority of our Open patients had a conventional Lewis operation (Table 3) . This reflects a trend in our clinical practice over the last decade of performing more MIEs instead of open procedures. A three-field technique is our procedure of choice, but we use a laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy for small distal tumors and where singlelung ventilation may be poorly tolerated. Prior laparotomy or prior right thoracotomy influences our decision to perform an open or hybrid operation. Morbid obesity, where there is no favorable neck anatomy for dissection, and cancers that extend into the fundus, where we may not be able to fashion a gastric conduit of sufficient length to reach to the neck, also influence our decision to perform a chest anastomosis. We preferentially perform neck anastomoses because leaks and stenoses are more easily managed in this configuration. Despite the difference in these operative proportions, our complications, mortality, and outcomes have remained equivalent. The one exception is the rate of RLN injury during MIE, which was 7 % in this series and continues to highlight the risks associated with the cervical dissection. RLN injury in this series is half of what we previously reported [30] as experience with neck dissection and development of a consistent approach and operative team has reduced nerve injury rates to close to zero. Currently, during dissection, we do not use any unipolar electrocautery deep to the strap muscles. We use bipolar cautery sparingly on small vessels, and the middle thyroid vessels are dissected carefully and taken sharply after suture ligation. Beyond this, only careful blunt or sharp dissection is performed. Even at 7 %, our RLN injury rate is lower than the 12.7 % reported by others from a pooled analysis of 28 comparative studies [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 519, "end": 523, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 734, "end": 738, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1252, "end": 1255, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1259, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1263, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1267, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1302, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1303, "end": 1306, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1310, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1325, "end": 1328, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1384, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1388, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1392, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2789, "end": 2793, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3376, "end": 3379, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1623, "end": 1632, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "The difference between our two groups in terms of neoadjuvant therapy (Table 1) should be addressed. The disparity is a result of the increased use of neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery that has occurred over the past decade coupled with our practice of performing more MIEs instead of open procedures. In this study, the use of neoadjuvant therapy did not lead to higher morbidity or mortality in the MIE group and this is consistent with the current literature [34] . In our multivariate model, preoperative neoadjuvant therapy had no significant effect on overall survival or on any of the other outcome variables, but this finding runs counter to that of several recent RCTs. Some have attributed increased node harvesting and fewer positive nodes to the use of neoadjuvant therapy. While our study shows a difference in node harvest favoring MIEs, there is no significant difference in the median number of positive nodes between our two groups (p = 0.84). Likewise, in a recent systematic review comparing MIE to open esophagectomy [13] , the authors report disparate lymph node retrieval data from across 17 comparative studies.

First, it is retrospective in nature and subject to bias and confounding from this perspective. Our current staging system, increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy, and multidisciplinary team approach to treating cancer was not available in the latter part of the 1990s which may contribute to differences in some patients in our Open group. Despite this, many of our outcomes are in agreement with the findings of the only randomized controlled trial currently available that compares Open to MIE [29] . Overall survival should also be interpreted with caution. Our Open group has had a longer follow-up period than our MIE group and it will take ongoing review of our data to determine if the MIE approach improves long-term survival over the open approach. Our pathological complete responder rate is lower than expected. In the Open group, this might be attributed to the lower rate of use of neoadjuvant therapy during the earlier treatment years. Overall, only 61 % of patients in this group received neoadjuvant therapy. In our MIE group, it is notable that only a small proportion of postoperative pathology specimens were available in our review of the registry. This loss of data may influence the reporting of accurate pathology response in this group. Finally, we did not analyze survival based on the histopathological types of cancer. Only 13 patients (16 %) had squamous cell histology in the MIE group and 8 (12 %) in the Open group (data not shown).
