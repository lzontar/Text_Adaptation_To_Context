A second series was administered at 12 weeks of age . At 10 weeks of age the dog developed intermittent, symmetric pelvic limb stiffness . One week later, stiffness progressed to the thoracic limbs . Within the next two days, the dog was markedly ataxic in all limbs . One day prior to presentation, the dog was non-ambulatory and anorexic . On physical examination the dog appeared alert and responsive but exhibited generalized muscle wasting . The dog was in a left lateral recumbent position and had marked extensor rigidity in all limbs, worse in the thoracic limbs . The neck was extended, and the dog attempted repeatedly to turn the neck and body to the right . Mental status and arousability appeared normal for this age of dog . The dog could neither sit nor stand and had absent proprioceptive placing of all limbs . Motor activity was present in all limbs when the dog was supported to walk. Spinal reflex testing elicited present but decreased withdrawal reflexes in the thoracic limbs which was attributed to the marked extensor tone . Hyperreflexive bilateral patellar and tibial deep tendon reflexes were present along with a crossed-extensor reflex . Nociceptive and funduscopic examination was normal . Diagnosis was of an encephalomyelopathy with possible peripheral nervous system involvement . Persistent turning of the neck and body to the right was indicative of right forebrain lesion (cerebral cortex, internal capsule or diencephalon) .

There was a marked, persistent right torticollis and right tilt of the head and neck . Coordination and strength of the head and neck was poor . Cranial nerve examination revealed a decreased menace response ; direct and consensual pupillary light reflex activity was present in both eyes . The right eye had a resting dilated pupil, decreased oculocephalic reflex, ventral-lateral strabismus, and decreased retractor oculi reflex . The gag reflex was diminished, and the dog did not bark. The dog was still non-ambulatory and had severe extensor ridgidity of the thoracic and pelvic limbs that was worse on the right side . Withdrawal reflexes of all limbs were diminished. Deep tendon reflexes of all limbs were increased, with cross-extensor reflexes . At this time, it was evident that there was a multifocal disease involving the central nervous system, with predominant diffuse cerebral and right lateralizing brainstem deficits . Cranial nerves III, V, VI, and VIII were affected with right lateralization .
