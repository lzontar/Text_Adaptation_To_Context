A recent study from Kim et al, 5 found that co-infections were frequent in their patient population in Northern California; more than 20% of 116 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens also contained one or more additional respiratory pathogens, most often rhinovirus/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and non-SARS Coronaviridae. Conversely, 7.5% of their specimens positive for a non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogen were also positive for SARS-CoV-2. 5 In addition, a study from Wuhan examining 8274 patients with 2745 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, revealed that 5.8% of SARS-CoV-2 infected and 18.4% of non-SARS-CoV-2-infected patients had co-infections. 6", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "To determine whether co-infections with other respiratory pathogens represent a significant subset of SARS-CoV-2 infections in our patient population, we reviewed results from our laboratory, which performs diagnostic testing for 8 inpatient and associated outpatient facilities in the greater New York City metropolitan area. tested 16,408 patients for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR, cobas\u00ae 6800 system, RocheDiagnostics); of those, 2,049 were also tested with the multiplex FilmArray\u00ae Respiratory Panel (RPPCR2, BioMerieux) or Cepheid Xpert\u00ae Xpress Flu/RSV (Flu/RSV). Our findings are notable for high rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (54.8 %) during that time period, and very low rates of co-infection with other non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens.
