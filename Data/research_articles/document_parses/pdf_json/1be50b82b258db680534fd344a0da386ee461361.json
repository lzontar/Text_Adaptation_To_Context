This is due to their large population sizes and short generation times, which are characterized by rapid accumulation of mutations relative to other organisms. Given the error-prone nature of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, viral replication leads to the formation of a quasispecies [1] [2] [3] . Rather than one virus producing identical progeny during replication, a population of viruses is produced, each differing from one another by nucleotide substitutions or deletions as a result of errors incorporated by the RNA polymerase. While the majority of these mutations will have neutral or negative effects on viral fitness, a small subset of these mutations may prove beneficial and enhance the ability for certain variants to replicate despite selective pressures of interest such as the host immune response or an antiviral drug. Forced adaptation experiments have been used to determine viral mutations that facilitate escape from drugs [4] [5] [6] , monoclonal antibodies [7, 8] , host restriction factors [9] [10] [11] , and species variation in host receptors [12] [13] [14] and to elucidate various viral mechanisms of infection and replication [15] [16] [17] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 377, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 378, "end": 381, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 382, "end": 385, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1039, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1043, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1047, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1075, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1078, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1109, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1114, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1119, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1166, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1171, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1172, "end": 1176, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1252, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1257, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1262, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Within the laboratory setting, the strength of selective pressure can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the levels of the restrictive factor, thus facilitating the rapid expansion of viral variants within the population of quasispecies that can overcome the applied selective pressure.
