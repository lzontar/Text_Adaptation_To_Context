The most intriguing finding of this study is that only 4% of healthcare providers without confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in their blood. Most of the healthcare providers were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the first few months of the outbreak when use of personal protection equipment was sparse as person-to-person transmission was not suspected. COVID-19 IgM/IgG tests in the US and around the world as reported in the news constantly showed that the true infection rate would be 10 to 80 times higher than that had been confirmed by RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in 1021 people before resuming work from April 3 to 15, 2020 in Wuhan was reported to be ~10%, 29 about 20 times higher than the infection attack rate calculated from the confirmed COVID-19 cases. In New York City, a 21.2% positive rate was reported with young and middle-aged people having the highest positive rate.

In Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, 2.88% (118/4099) healthcare workers were diagnosed with COVID-19 before March 16, 2020. With a moderate estimation, the true infection rate would be ten times that had been confirmed, i.e., >25% of those healthcare providers without diagnosed COVID-19 had been infected. However, only 4% of those infected healthcare workers without confirmed COVID-19 still had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. They just got infected with SARS-CoV-2 and cleared the virus by their own immune systems. No long-lasting protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were produced in these healthcare providers. Our observed high prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in older groups (60-69 years old and \u2265 70 years old) among health care workers and general worker in Wuhan also raised the concern that IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 would be lost some time after the infection was cleared, as young or middle-aged people usually took more social responsibilities and had higher chances to get infected during lockdown of the city. We also found that >10% of confirmed COVID-19 cases had no detectable serum levels of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after 21 days post symptom onset. They were unlikely to not produce IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after being infected with the virus 20,24-26,30 . Long et al reported that after 17-19 days post symptom onset, IgG was positive in all patients with COVID-19. 30 Lack of blood samples >17 days post symptom onset may be responsible for negative IgG tests in some patients reported in previous literatures. 25, 26 Therefore, >10% patients in our study who had no IgG antibodies after 21 days post symptom onset most likely lost those IgG antibodies after the infection was resolved.
