            "text": "The latest technological advancements emerging as daily commodities are so farreaching that our ways of thinking, feeling, acting and relate with others may be transformed at a very silent and rapid pace. But what investments are being made to determine the kind of culture, usage and ethics people want, need and may be able to spread through their technology mediated performances? In fact, works on ethical assessment of new tech, including AI-powered environments, are gaining traction [1, 2] . Education-wise huge worldwide governmental investments were made for the deployment of laptops, broad access to Internet and educational software, some integrating AI [3] , intelligent tutoring systems [4] , and robots [5] . Although we may consider relevant some achievements over the last 25 years, AIEd is quite a new discipline and a research overview revealed a lack of critical reflection of its challenges and risks [6, 7] . In fact, AIEd is covering an unprecedent range of cognitive functions and easing some routine tasks through automated grading, feedback loops, virtual facilitators, personalised learning, customised materials, and proctoring. But ideologies, fantasies, and projections about what the future should or is expected to be inform the development of these technological solutions. So, who may be accountable for AIEd development and scope? How is sense of agency being enhanced or constrained in the processes it enables? And how is our Judgement of Agency [8] being respected by its automations? In fact, many studies emphasised the sense of agency role in user experience and interface design [9] and some found a conundrum in the association of automation and sense of agency [10, 11] . This PhD research is being developed under the premise that sense of agency is at the heart of learning, enabling experiences of signification that may foster lifelong orientation for learning. It also considers sense of agency core for legal and ethical structures [12] . So, this research aims at contributing to the public debate on AIEd, so that its researchers/developers become more sensitive and critical towards ethical learning-related issues. Furthermore, it intends to foster teachers' critical thinking on AIEd, by directly recognising their current attitudes and levels of awareness on the matter. Teachers are expected to be empowered to decide whether they want to use AIEd or not, to recognise the ways these technologies enter and may transform classrooms and learners and how they may integrate these resources into their pedagogical practices.",

Given the fact that this research's theoretical corpus is on its first growing years, the option for the Delphi method seemed accurate, enabling the identification of guiding theories, variables, causal relationships, constructs, instruments and generating a common language for discussion [14] . The structure is planned as follows: 1.1.

Participants will (a) rethink their first responses, (b) choose the 2 main critical items for each criterion, and (3) conclude on the drivers, the potential ethical challenges, and the current existing controls. Data will be analysed through descriptive statistics that will be further shared with the experts. 1.5. These new ideas will be voted by the group to define a final list on each criterion and further create a hypothetical dilemma reflecting an ethical challenge posed by AIEd. 1.6. Participants will vote 3 dilemmas (better exploration of AIEd ethical challenges). 1.7. Results will be shared with the entire group. Then, providing directions on CPD needs, a focus group of circa 7-10 teachers will be presented 3 ethical dilemmas (resulting from the previous research design). This will constitute a common basis to identify what AI tech might be like and speak about the AIEd construct. Teachers will be invited to choose the most impactful dilemma in terms of learning implications, justifying their choices. They are expected to highlight potential consequences to students' sense of agency resulting from the use of that tech under the described circumstances (or others). Then, teachers will be also invited to explore the needs of a school community in what concerns AIEd.

Throughout the course teachers will (1) identify AIEd applications, (2) explore its potential and challenges in terms of learning, and (3) specifically identify the effects of AIEd ethical challenges upon sense of agency. Then, a group of around 5 teachers will be invited to a final semi-structured interview to grasp teachers' attitudes towards AIEd regarding learning experiences' processes.
