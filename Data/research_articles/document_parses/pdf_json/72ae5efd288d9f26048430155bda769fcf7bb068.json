However, there are a lot other viruses and bacteria that can be potential bioterrorism weapons. A system that can automatically suggest potential bioterrorism weapons will help laypeople to discover these suspicious viruses and bacteria. In this paper we apply instance-based learning & text mining approach to identify candidate viruses and bacteria as potential bio-terrorism weapons from biomedical literature. We first take text mining approach to identify topical terms of existed viruses (bacteria) from PubMed separately. Then, we use the term lists as instances to build matrices with the remaining viruses (bacteria) to discover how much the term lists describe the remaining viruses (bacteria). Next, we build a algorithm to rank all remaining viruses (bacteria). We suspect that the higher the ranking of the virus (bacterium) is, the more suspicious they will be potential bio-terrorism weapon.

Biological agent is one of five categories of terrorist weapons. For certain biological agents, the potential for devastating casualties is very high. The anthrax mail attack in October, 2001 terrorism caused 23 cases of anthrax-related illness and 5 deaths. Due to the widespread availability of agents, widespread knowledge of production methodologies, and potential dissemination devices, bioterrorism can be very cute for now and future. Because it is very difficult for laypeople diagnose and recognize most of the diseases caused by biological weapons, we need surveillance systems to keep an eye on potential uses of such biological weapons [1] . In this paper, we propose an instance based learning method to discover biological agents as potential Bioterrorism Weapons (BW).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 700, "end": 703, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Before discovering potential BW, it's reasonable to study the characteristics of biological agents identified by human experts as BW. Some human experts have generalized some criteria for identifying virus and bacteria. The more detail is in section 3. However, it's hard for human being to map all the viruses and bacteria one by one to these criteria. Moreover, the list is compiled manually, requiring extensive specialized human resources and time. Because the biological agents such as viruses are evolving through mutations, biological or chemical change, some biological substances have the potential to turn into deadly virus through chemical/genetic/biological reaction, there should be an automatic approach to keep track of existing suspicious viruses and to discover new viruses as potential weapons. We expect that it would be very useful to identify those biological substances and take precaution actions or measurements. For better studying the characteristics of existed biological agents as BW, we use a text mining approach to extract topical MeSH terms from them. This is an exhaustive approach, so we believe that the topical MeSH terms we extract are very representative of the particular BW collection. Then, we use this discovered terms to build a term biological agent matrix from which we check how much these terms can be topical terms for the remaining biological agents. Later, we use the combination of these terms to rank each remaining biological agent. In the end, we get a top ranked term list that can be used as key words for human experts to examine the remaining biological agents. The most important is that we generate a biological agent as potential BW ranked by the extracted terms from the existed biological agents. We suspect that the higher rank the biological agent, the more it can become potential BW.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The problem of mining implicit knowledge/information from biomedical literature was exemplified by Dr. Swanson's pioneering work on Raynaud disease/fish-oil discovery in 1986 [5] . Back then, the Raynaud disease had no known cause or cure, and the goal of his literature-based discovery was to uncover novel suggestions for how Raynaud disease might be caused, and how it might be treated. He found from biomedical literature that Raynaud disease is a peripheral circulatory disorder aggravated by high platelet aggregation, high blood viscosity and vasoconstriction. In another separate set of literature on fish oils, he found out the ingestion of fish oil can reduce these phenomena. But no single article from both sets in the biomedical literature mentions Raynaud and fish oil together in 1986. Putting these two separate literatures together, Swanson hypothesized that fish oil may be beneficial to people suffering from Raynaud disease [5] [6] . This novel hypothesis was later clinically confirmed by DiGiacomo in 1989 [2] . Later on [4] Dr. Swanson extended his methods to search literature for potential virus. But the biggest limitation of his methods is that, only 3 properties/criteria of a virus are used as search key word and the semantic information is ignored in the search procedure. In this paper, we present a novel biomedical literature mining algorithms based on this philosophy with significant extensions. Our objective is to extend the existing known virus list compiled by CDC or bacterium recognized by domain experts as BTW to other viruses/ bacteria that might have similar characteristics. We thus hypothesize that viruses/bacteria that have been researched with respect to the characteristics possessed by existing viruses are leading candidates for extending the virus/bacterium lists.
