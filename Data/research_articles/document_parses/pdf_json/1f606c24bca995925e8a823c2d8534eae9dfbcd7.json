From the observation, it is evident that for Bangladesh the number of total confirmed death is increased by a factor of 2.2 in the 5 days (21 deaths on 10 April and 46 deaths on 15 April). In addition, the number of total confirmed case is increased by a factor of 2.1 in the 3 days (482 confirmed case on 12 April and 1012 confirmed case on 15 April). It is also notable that, the number of confirmed cases in the country increased rapidly as the conduction of number of test increased in passage of time. Until 15 April 2020 a total of 14,868-specimen have been tested which was 13.25% higher in comparing with the total test (13,128) performed on 14 April 2020. As of 15 April 2020 69.0% (44/64) district of the country has already been infected with minimum one confirmed COVID-19 case. Until now, Bangladesh has only reported 5.92% (1231/20,804) of confirmed cases in South East Asian Region with a case fatality rate of 5.26 % (50/950). Importantly, regarding the trend of daily confirmed cases in terms of number of days since 100 th confirmed cases, Bangladesh (803 on the 7 days of 100 confirmed case) shows the similar trend till now with France (716), USA (754), Pakistan (887) and Thailand (721). However, no countries have the same trend as Bangladesh in terms of days since the fifth confirmed deaths until now. The pandemic has shown us how quickly a new epidemic will catch up and spread.
