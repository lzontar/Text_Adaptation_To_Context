April 7 experienced the most symptomatic cases among detained persons (n = 31).133 INTERVENTIONS 134 Early interventions included enhanced cleaning and disinfection, eliminating aerosol-generating 135 procedures (e.g., continuous positive airway pressure devices [CPAP]) in common areas (beginning 136 March 20), hand hygiene education, and training staff on personal protective equipment (PPE) use.137 CCJ began \"sheltering in place\" March 9, placing generalized restrictions on compound-wide movement 138 and reducing programmatic activity.

All programmatic 141 activity was suspended on March 23. 142 CDPH conducted an on-site assessment on March 25 and provided guidance consistent with 143 interventions already implemented by CHS/CCH. These included symptom screening (later supplemented 144 by COVID-19 testing) at intake, immediate medical isolation of symptomatic individuals, social distancing, 145 and quarantine of all detained persons on the unit for \u2265 14 days. Social distancing included spacing beds 146 6 feet apart in dormitories and reducing all cells to single occupancy beginning March 26 and completed 147 by April 21. CDPH expanded infection control guidance for staff, including recommendations for PPE use 148 based on task and cohorting by duty location (Figure 2).149 Beginning March 28, all staff were screened for fever (99.4 F/38 C) and COVID-19 symptoms upon 150 entry into CCJ. 5 Presence of fever or symptoms required staff to abstain from work for 14 days. A PPE 151 accountability team was assembled April 1, and staff were required to use surgical masks beginning April 152 2.

The Residential Treatment Unit (RTU) housed more individuals with medical needs and at increased risk 165 for COVID-19 medical complications than other divisions.

Weekly averages demonstrated a decline in cases 183 among detained persons a week after staff cases began declining. had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. This represents an AR of nearly 13% among detained 190 persons and occurred despite early adoption of containment and mitigation practices. This constitutes 191 one of the largest outbreaks of COVID-19 in a congregate setting described to date, illustrating the 192 difficulties of controlling spread in correctional and detention facilities. Estimates of influenza spread in 193 enclosed populations have found similar ARs 9 (13%); experience suggests viral respiratory pathogens 194 like COVID-19 can cause sizeable epidemics in large jails despite implementation of public health 195 interventions. 10 Expanding CCJ's footprint to facilitate physical distancing, limiting movement, and 196 implementing expanded testing were complex and resource-intensive interventions, but effectively slowed 197 spread relative to the surrounding community even as cases there surged. Implementing expanded 198 diagnostic testing at key points, such as intake, helped limit new introductions of the virus. 199 Investigations into outbreaks of respiratory viruses in other correctional and detention facilities have 200 identified visitors 11 and persons transferred between facilities 12 as possible sources. Restriction of 201 movement within the jail was likely one of the most critical and timely interventions in gaining control of 202 this outbreak; the division with the highest level of movement and most contact with individuals entering 203 from the community experienced the earliest peak. Implementation and enforcement of social distancing 204 of \u2265 6 feet, surgical mask use, increased access to soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and enhanced 205 cleaning and disinfection practices also likely reduce extent of spread. Later expansion of diagnostic 206 testing, including at intake and of asymptomatic individuals, allowed for medical isolation of cases and 207 reduction in spread. Enhanced measures including PPE accountability were likely also effective. 208 Our data suggest the important role that community-dwelling staff played in COVID-19 introductions into 209 CCJ as cases among staff often preceded cases in detained persons. We also show the effectiveness of 210 employee interventions despite inclusion of <100% of personnel. Implementation of universal screening 211 for symptoms and temperature checks is important, but ensuring access to testing and compliance with 212 illness reporting are vital, as are flexible and non-punitive leave policies to allow sick employees to stay 213 home.As with other outbreaks in correctional and detention facilities 13 , close cooperation between onsite 215 medical service providers, law enforcement, and local and federal public health officials were critical to 216 successful containment of COVID-19. Efforts to facilitate social distancing and medical isolation through 217 expanding CCJ's footprint likely reduced transmission. 14 Physical distancing to the degree accomplished 218 at CCJ may not be feasible in all facilities, but use of quarantine and cohort housing may be possible 219 even in smaller, more restricted facilities.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "Criteria for inclusion in description of a COVID-19 outbreak in one of the largest jails in the United States-Cook County, IL, March 1-April 30, 2020 Abbreviations: CCSO (Cook County Sheriff's Office); CCJ (Cook County Jail); PCR (polymerase chain reaction assay; SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).Excluded due to no contact with detained persons (only applicable to staff) persons, and 279 symptomatic staff were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 and included in analyses.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "Number", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "We describe the subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 among detained persons and staff at CCJ and interventions to reduce transmission.
