More important, patients with HAdV-C2, HAdV-E4, and HAdV-B7 were more likely to have severe disease. Hence, it seems prudent for public health officials and clinicians to consider using antiviral therapies and HAdV vaccines in Singapore. For instance, brincidofovir, an experimental antiviral therapy, is being used in the USA against severe HAdV infections with good outcomes [39] [40] [41] . In addition, a very effective \"Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral\" has been used among US military personnel since 1971. The new version of this vaccine, used since 2011, has resulted in a dramatic decline of respiratory infections among US military recruits [42] .

The high prevalence of HAdV-E4 infections identified in our study is intriguing. The HAdV-E4 genes and genome have been shown to be almost identical to several chimpanzee adenoviruses, including the SAdV-E25 genome at 91% and the SAdV-E26 at 92%, with the 1952 prototype as reference [38, 43] . These values are consistent with HAdV-E4 being the only HAdV amongst several chimpanzee adenoviruses phylogenetically grouped within HAdV species E, supporting a zoonotic origin, consistent with current hypotheses that cross-species infections may lead to the emergence of novel human pathogens [44] . Furthermore, sequence analysis of 2 recent circulating HAdV-E4 strains revealed a recombination event that provides a conserved DNA replication motif (NF-I), likely from a respiratory pathogen of HAdV species B, that is present in almost all HAdVs but absent in SAdVs as well as the HAdV-E4 prototype and contemporaneously circulating isolates, including the \"vaccine\" strain [38, 45] . This HAdV-like motif, as well as the conserved core origin and NF-III motif, were present in all 6 of the fully sequenced Singapore HAdV-E4 genomes. The NF-I human transcription factor and its binding have been extensively characterized molecularly and biochemically as required for optimal HAdV DNA replication [46, 47] . This putative genome-based host adaptation may be the \"tipping point\" that has allowed HAdV-E4 entry into a global general population, which is presumably immunologically naive to its epsilon (hexon) antigen, because HAdV-E4 had been known to circulate sporadically [20, [48] [49] [50] .

Our study could have been strengthened by testing blood (or another sterile compartment such as CSF) from all study patients or by testing matched patient controls to demonstrate a stronger probability of disease association. However, the prevalent genotypes identified (ie, HAdV-B3, HAdV-B7, and HAdV-E4) were genotypes that are commonly known to cause acute respiratory infections. Finally, mixed HAdV infections could not be ruled out as the cause of the untypable patient samples (14%). This theory is supported by the observed increased risk for severe disease among patients infected with an \"unknown\" HAdV genotype, as well as the high prevalence (40.9%) of unknown HAdV genotype infections among immunocompromised patients in our study.
