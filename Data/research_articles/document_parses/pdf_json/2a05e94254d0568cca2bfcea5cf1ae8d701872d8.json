We sought to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in this special population. Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted in an underserved area with a predominance of African American patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample population. The onset of AKI and relation to clinical outcomes were determined. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with AKI. Results: Nearly half (49.3%) of the patients with COVID-19 had AKI. Patients with AKI had a significantly lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher FiO 2 requirement and D-dimer levels on admission. More subnephrotic proteinuria and microhematuria was seen in these patients, and the majority had a pre-renal urine electrolyte profile. Patients with hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) as opposed to those with community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) had higher rates of in-hospital death (52 vs. 23%, p = 0.005), need for vasopressors (42 vs. 25%, p = 0.024), and need for intubation (55 vs. 25%,",

            "text": "In December 2019, several pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China were shown to be caused by a novel coronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] . COVID-19 typically presents as an acute respiratory illness that can quickly progress to respiratory failure. Multiorgan involvement is also common, including damage to the kidneys, heart, and gastrointestinal tract, mirroring the presence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in these organs, which serves as a portal of entry for the virus [2] . In particular, acute kidney injury (AKI) as one major complication of COVID-19 occurred in 17-29% of in-hospital patients based on reports from China, the USA, and some European countries [3] [4] [5] [6] . The potential mechanisms of AKI in COVID-19 patients include direct viral cytopathic effects, cytokine damage, microthrombi in the renal circulation, and hypoperfusive injury. Furthermore, AKI was found to be a significant poor prognostic marker among patients with COVID-19 [3] . The described burden of AKI in patients with COVID-19 has predominantly been reported in patients of non-African American origin. There are emerging data on worse outcomes of COVID-19 in African American patients [7] and in patients from underserved socioeconomic groups who also have higher rates of preexisting cardiorenal metabolic disease risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. These comorbidities have in turn been shown to portend an overall worse prognosis [8] [9] [10] . The primary objective of this study is to describe the onset, nature, characteristics, and predictive factors of AKI in this high-risk patient population with COVID-19.",

            "text": "This is a single-center retrospective study. We included all patients > 18 years of age who were admitted to a tertiary inner-city hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We excluded patients who were still hospitalized as of the time of chart review and analysis, as the final disposition related to outcomes could not be ascertained at the time of writing this report. We also excluded patients with incomplete data on clinical outcomes, those on maintenance hemodialysis, and patients on remdesivir or convalescent plasma therapy as both these were introduced in our institution protocol at the time of this data analysis. The definition used for AKI in this study was an increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL or 1.5-fold from the baseline based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria [11] . Patients admitted to the hospital with AKI based on the first serum creatinine measured were denoted as having community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI). In contrast, patients were identified as having hospitalacquired AKI (HA-AKI) when AKI was not apparent upon hospital admission but developed during hospitalization. The baseline serum creatinine level was defined as the lowest measured serum creatinine within the preceding 3 months. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was computed using the CKD-API equation using the latest serum creatinine value available in that same period of time. All data were extracted from electronic medical records. Demographic variables were presented using descriptive statistics and frequencies. Categorical variables were analyzed with \u03c7 2 testing. Demographic and clinical variables were tabulated. The \u03c7 2 test was used to analyze the relationship between demographic or comorbidity variables and AKI, need for intubation, and vasopressor use. Multivariate logistic regression was used to look at the factors associated with AKI. We utilized 95% confidence intervals, which are presented when appropriate. Our study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB No. 2020-435).",

In that final sample, the mean age was 65.91 \u00b1 14.95 years, 48% were female, and 68% were African American. Of the total patients (n = 223), 72% had hypertension, 47% had diabetes, and 49% had documented AKI. Of the patients who had AKI, 72% were diagnosed on admission (CA-AKI), while 28% developed AKI during the hospital stay (HA-AKI). There were no differences in rates of AKI based on gender (p = 0.52) or race (p = 0.50). However, there were significantly more cases of AKI among older patients (> 60 years old) compared to younger subjects (84 vs. 16%, p < 0.0001). Among patients with AKI, there was a significantly higher incidence of heart failure (19 vs. 4%, p = 0.002), hypertension (80 vs. 64%, p = 0.003), and baseline chronic kidney disease regardless of stage (27 vs. 9%, p = 0.001). Of the patients with AKI, 8% needed continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or intermittent hemodialysis (HD). Among those who required CRRT/HD, 89% were intubated and 78% died. Baseline eGFR was significantly lower among the patients who had AKI compared to those without (79.61 vs. 99.16 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , p = 0.002). On admission, those with AKI had higher FiO 2 requirements (44 vs. 34%, p = 0.007) and D-dimer levels (5,468 vs. 2,248 ng/mL, p = 0.04) than those without. On urinalysis, patients who had AKI had significantly more proteinuria (74 vs. 48%, p = 0.003), which was predominantly subnephrotic (87%) via the urine protein to creatinine ratio, and microscopic hematuria (65 vs. 42%, p = 0.014). The majority (69%) of patients who had AKI had a prerenal urine electrolyte profile, while 31% had an elevated fraction excretion of sodium. This pattern did not show significant differences by age, gender, ethnicity, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status. There were also no significant differences in urinary electrolyte profile between patients with CA-AKI and HA-AKI (prerenal profile in CA-AKI vs. HA-AKI = 64 vs. 81%, p = 0.436) as well as those intubated and non-intubated (39 vs. 31%, p = 0.140). The development of AKI was associated with poor clinical outcomes, including death, need for intubation, and need for vasopressors (Table 1) Color version available online who had HA-AKI did worse with these clinical outcomes when compared to patients who had CA-AKI (Fig. 2, 3) . Multivariate logistic regression found that age (OR 1.029, 95% CI 1.001-1.057, p = 0.042) and history of heart failure (OR 3.851, 95% CI 1.121-13.231, p = 0.032) were shown to be significantly associated with AKI after adjusting for baseline eGFR ( Table 2) .

            "text": "Interestingly, heart failure was consistently associated with AKI in this report, even after adjusting for baseline eGFR in the multivariate logistic regression, suggesting a possible cardiorenal component to the development of worsening kidney function. In COVID-19 patients with underlying heart failure, the development of cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) could be a type 1 CRS phenotype as a sequela of cardiomyopathy from cytokine storm/ myocarditis, a type 3 CRS phenotype from the development of AKI leading to cardiac myocyte injury, or a type 5 CRS presentation with dual cardiac and kidney injury from inflammation, increased vascular permeability, and microthrombi [15, 16] . Also, heart-kidney crosstalk could be contributory to this observation, as cardiomyopathy can lead to renal congestion, hypotension, and renal hypoperfusion leading to a reduction in GFR [16] . In relation to this, one retrospective study reported a significant association of right ventricular dilation to mortality among COVID-19 patients [17] . The myocardial dysfunction can possibly be attributed to hypoxia, thrombotic events, direct viral damage, and cytokine storm in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 [17] . This then can also potentially induce renal dysfunction via the cardiorenal mechanism. It is notable that in our study there was a significantly greater number of patients who needed intubation in the group with AKI compared to those without. High requirements of positive pressure ventilation in patients with COVID-19 can lead to potential deleterious hemodynamic consequences of reduced cardiac output contributing to renal hypoperfusion, which may play a role in the mechanism of AKI in these patients [18] . In our study, more patients who were intubated had a higher rate of having a pre-renal profile compared to those who were not intubated. However, this was not statistically significant, which is probably related to the relatively low absolute number of intubations.",

In our study, ACE/ARB use was not associated either AKI or inpatient death. Thus, it may be prudent to consider maintenance of ACEI/ARB in patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with a history of heart failure unless contraindicated by hemodynamic compromise or refractory hyperkalemia.

Patients with AKI have significantly higher D-dimer levels as well as FiO 2 requirement on admission than those without AKI. Given these findings, it is possible that this particular group of patients had more severe COVID-19 disease on presentation. Although D-dimer has low specificity, several studies have suggested that it can be elevated in patients with AKI with activated coagulation being associated with systemic inflammatory syndrome as well in severe COVID-19 infection, along with increased interleukin-6 levels, as a consequence of cytokine release syndrome [22, 23] . Furthermore, increased FiO 2 requirement indicative of alveolar damage and impending respiratory failure can also contribute to renal medullary hypoxia compounding the renal hypoperfusion from combined effects of endothelial damage, third-space fluid loss, and hypotension from COVID-19-induced cytokine release [16] . Urine sediments of these patients showed subnephrotic proteinuria and microhematuria, which are consistent with autopsy findings of kidney tissues of COVID-19 patients showing severe acute tubular necrosis with macrophage infiltration of the tubulointerstitium and diffuse proximal tubule injury with erythrocyte aggregates obstructing the peritubular capillaries [24] . Lastly, patients with AKI had significantly lower GFR both at baseline and during admission compared to those without AKI, which is congruous with the well-established observation that a low eGFR at baseline is considered to be a strong and consistent risk factor for AKI, especially in the critical care setting [25] .",

Patients who developed HA-AKI had poorer outcomes than those with CA-AKI. Perhaps those with CA-AKI may have had easily reversible etiologies, including poor oral intake and volume depletion, while HA-AKI may signal multiorgan deterioration in the setting of severe COVID-19 or even the influence of decompensated cardiorenal mechanisms in our population. This assumption is supported by the fact that a low urine fractional excretion of sodium (FE Na ) or urea (FE Urea ) profile was seen in the majority of the AKI patients regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, HIV status, and onset of AKI. Arguably, low FE Na can also be seen in clear-cut causes of intrinsic kidney disease, such as contrast-induced nephropathy, acute interstitial nephritis, rhabdomyolysis, and early tubular obstruction, which could be present in our patients as well [27] . However, based on the comparison between urine electrolytes in CA-AKI and HA-AKI, a prerenal urine index per se does not help prognosticate AKI in these patients given the lack of serial profiling and documenting any change in this pattern, especially in those with HA-AKI.",
