The eddy covariance method and isotope signals of rain, plant, soil, and stream waters were used to determine forest water sources under different moisture conditions. Four sampling events were conducted to collect soil and plant twig samples in wet, moderate, dry, and very dry conditions for the identification of isotopic signals. Annual ET from 2012 to 2015 was quite stable with an average of 1,182 \u00b1 26 mm, and a substantial daily ET was observed even during drought periods, although some decline was observed, corresponding with volumetric soil water content. During the wet period, water for ET was supplied from the surface soil layer between 0 and 0.5 m, whereas in the dry period, approximately 50% to 90% was supplied from the deeper soil layer below 0.5-m depth, originating from water precipitated several months previously at this forest. Isotope signatures demonstrated that the water sources of the plants, soil, and stream were all different. Water in plants was often different from soil water, probably because plant water came from a different source than water that was strongly bound to the soil particles. Plants showed no preference for soil depth with their size, whereas the existence of storage water in the xylem was suggested. The evapotranspiration at this forest is balanced and maintained using most of the available water sources except for a proportion of rapid response run-off.

Using isotope indices, we can investigate whether soil water, streamflow, and plant transpiration are all sourced and mediated by the same well-mixed water reservoir originating in the soil (Evaristo et al., 2015) . The depth of water uptake can also be estimated by measuring the isotopic composition of xylem water and soil water at different depths (Ehleringer & Dawson, 1992; Yang et al., 2015) . Many previous studies utilize only one of the dual stable isotopes of \u03b4 18 O (Nie et al., 2011; Querejeta, Estrada-Medina, Allen, & Jimenez-Osornio, 2007) or \u03b4 2 H (Filella & Penuelas, 2003; Jackson, Cavelier, Goldstein, Meinzer, & Holbrook, 1995) .

The soil in this area belongs to the local Durian series, which is classified as an ultisol with a yellowish silt-clay layer (40-80 cm thick), overlaying a blocky indurated lateritic horizon (30-40 cm thick) on top of mottled white clay that overlays weathered shale down to a depth of 130-150 cm (Leigh, 1982) .

Manokaran (1979) reported an annual interception value of 519 mm (21.8%) for Pasoh FR. Subsequently, Tani et al. (2003) recorded an annual interception for Pasoh FR from 1999 to 2000 of 381.3 mm (16.9%). Throughfall ranged between 79% and 94% in this forest (Konishi et al., 2006) . In terms of run-off generation, a substantial amount of overland flow was measured using the trap method, indicating a close relationship with the amount of rainfall (Leigh, 1978) . Data were sampled at 10 Hz and sent to a data logger (CR-5000 or CR-1000, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT). Momentum, sensible heat (H, W m \u22122 ), and latent heat (\u019bE, W m \u22122 ) fluxes were calculated as 30min averages. Double rotation (McMillen, 1988) was applied, assuming a zero mean vertical wind. The Webb-Pearman-Leuning (Webb, Pearman, & Leuning, 1980) correction for the effect of air density fluctuations was also applied, and linear trends in temperature and water vapour were retained. Our EC measurements of ET included transpiration, interception evaporation, and soil evaporation. We discarded all latent heat flux data recorded during and after rainfall; however, this gap was filled using available energy and sensible heat flux data measured using a three-dimensional ultrasonic anemometer, which can collect data during rainfall. A detailed description of these methods and instruments is provided by Kosugi and colleagues (Kosugi, Takanashi, Tani, et al., 2012; Kosugi et al., 2008) . The energy budget correction was executed to overcome the energy imbalance problem described by Takanashi et al. (2010) in estimating ET. Both sensible and latent heat fluxes are corrected using the Bowen ratio to produce zero energy imbalance (Kosugi, Takanashi, Tani, et al., 2012) . Gaps were further filled using a second-order polynomial relationship between 30min \u03bbEs after the energy budget correction method, and the available The energy released by changes in the air, vapour, and trunk storage was estimated using temperature and vapour pressure differences at the top of the tower based on Ohtani et al. (1997) . Air temperature and humidity at a height of 52 m were observed using an HMP45A or HMP45C instrument (Vaisala, Vantaa, Finland). An Assmann psychrometer (SY-3D, Yoshino Keiki, Japan) was used to calibrate the Vaisala sensors periodically. The vapour pressure deficit (VPD) of the air was calculated from these data. Tipping-bucket rain gauges (Ota Keiki 34-T, Japan) were used to measure rainfall at the top of the 52-m flux tower and at an observatory located 430 m away from the tower. These data were compared and corrected with the rainfall measured with a storage gauge at the observatory. The volumetric soil water content (VSWC) was measured using time domain reflectometry sensors (CS615 or CS616, Campbell Scientific) at depths of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 m at three points around the tower logged at the 30-min intervals (Noguchi et al., 2016) . This layer contains the majority of the fine roots. The mean rooting depth in a mixed dipterocarp forest has been identified as 2.35 m (Baillie & Mamit, 1983) . We used the daily average value of these nine sensors as a reference VSWC for the surface layer between 0 and 0.5 m. The time domain reflectometry sensors were calibrated using the standard procedure for calibrating capacitance sensors outlined by Starr and Paltineanu (2002) , which consists of nine steps (Noguchi et al., 2016) . Solar noon in this site peaks around 01:00 p.m. local time (Kosugi, Takanashi, Tani, et al., 2012) . The antecedent precipitation index (API60) was tested and found to have a significant relationship with the VSWC (Noguchi et al., 2016) and was therefore used as a wetness index in this study area. The API60 is defined as \u2211 60 i\u00bc1 P i =i, where P i is the daily precipitation (mm) and i is the number of preceding days (Kosugi et al., 2007). 2.3 | Isotope signatures of water in precipitation, stream, plants, and soil A storage-type rain gauge with a double-layered small-mouth inner glass bottle was installed at the observatory station to collect rainwater samples and was buried in the ground to prevent heating and evaporation.

(1994) reported that some rainforests are able to extract soil water even in the dry season because of deep rooting depths. In Pasoh FR, the rooting depth was concentrated in the A horizon (Amir Husni, 1989) but extended down to 4 m (Niiyama et al., 2010) . On the basis of energy imbalance filtering data, ET was stable with a slight increase in the dry season in central Amazonian rainforest sites, whereas in drier semideciduous sites, it showed a slight decrease during the dry season . This site-dependent difference was caused by differences in the increasing radiation energy and the stomatal behaviour during the dry season. ET is mainly determined by atmospheric evaporative demand (e.g., Carswell et al., 2002; Da Rocha et al., 2004; Z. Li et al., 2010) and stomatal control (e.g., Cunningham, 2004) , the latter of which is influenced by the factors related to water supply, such as available water in the soil (e.g., Burgess, Adam, Turner, & Ong, 1998; Rafael, Todd, Burgess, & Nepstad, 2005) , rooting depth (e.g., Z.

The overall resistance is determined by soil water potential, conducting vessels, transpiration rate, plant height, and gravity (Kim et al., 2014) ; however, the results from this study do not necessarily reflect this trend. The isotope signals from trees of different height and species did not show any clear tendency of water uptake depth during the study period. From these results, we could not distinguish whether shorter or smaller trees use water from the shallow soil layer, whereas taller trees take water from the deeper soil layer. Water uptake by co-occurring woody species showed that some species only take water from deep or shallow soil, whereas others use both layers (Eggermeyer et al., 2009; West et al., 2007) . In tropical and subtropical forests, plants typically have shallow roots, meeting their water needs from the surface soil layer due to the plentiful rainfall (Schenk & Jackson, 2005) and soil properties would also be associated with variability in isotopic values (Orlowski, Pratt, & McDonnell, 2016) .

Deep rooting and stomatal control are two well-known mechanisms that allow plants to cope with periods of high atmospheric demand and low water availability. Isotope analysis results show that plants, soil, and stream have different sources of water in this forest. Similarity in rainwater and stream water indicates the dominance of new water run-off. There are occasional isotopic differences between plants and soil water, probably because water source for plants is different from water strongly bounded to the soil. The source of water for this forest does not have a distinct pattern corresponding to soil depth and tree height. The results also suggest the existence and use of water storage in tree xylem.

The arrow indicates the four sampling periods for plant and soil water whereas if the decline slope of the water budget of the surface soil layer is shallower than that of evaporative demand, water is supplied from deeper layers. Note that the soil water storage differentials in soils at depths of 0-0.5 m are the result of not only ET but also drainage to the deeper layer. Because we did not account for the drainage portion, we should expect some overestimation if we consider that the differential was used only for transpiration and soil evaporation.We should also note that the comparison in this figure becomes too complicated during and just after rainfall, which includes interception evaporation, water input from the soil surface, and drainage to the deeper layer.Figure 5ademonstrated that, spatially, plants in Pasoh FR usually obtained their water supply from the surface soil layer (0-0.5 m) and from the deeper layer when the soil water content at 0-0.5 m decreased. For example, at the beginning of 2014 and 2015, when the slope of the water budget declined drastically compared to that of the surface soil water budget, it can be inferred that plants used a substantial portion of water from deeper soil layers. The individual trend on each sampling day was investigated (Figure 5b). The declining slopes of evaporative demand in June 2013 and March 2014 were greater than the declining slopes of soil water storage at 0-0.5 m. Approximately 50% of ET demand in June 2013 and only 10% in March 2014 were supplied from surface soil layers. This indicates that water was supplied from deeper soil layers. In November 2014 and January 2015, the declining slopes of the water budget of surface soil water and ET demand could not be compared simply because of rainfall intermissions, although similar decline slopes for the ET demand and surface layer soil water budget were observed, with a slightly larger ET demand. 3.3 | Stable isotope signatures of plants, soil, and stream water Figure 6 provides an overview of how water is compartmentalized for different uses in the forest ecosystem. The daily \u03b4 18 O in precipitation in Pasoh FR varied considerably (Figure 6a, Marryanna et al., 2017). The \u03b4 18 O value in precipitation during the monsoon onset in May (south-west) and November (north-east) tended to decrease and was lower during the middle of the rainy season compared to the beginning of the rainy and drier seasons. The isotope value was depleted when rainfall was greater (Marryanna et al., 2017). The \u03b4 18 O values of the occasional stream water samples showed a similar time series trend to the rainwater isotope value (\u22124.97 \u00b1 1.9, n = 19). Substantial fluctuations in \u03b4 18 O in stream water were detected, corresponding well to those in precipitation. The \u03b4 18 O values in soil water at deeper soil layers (3.0 m) were generally stable for the whole observation period regardless of season and thus sometimes showed more negative values (\u22127.80 \u00b1 0.29) compared to the 30-day running average of these values in precipitation. Larger temporal fluctuations were observed in surface soil layers (0.05 m: \u22126.67 \u00b1 1.96; 0.3 m: \u22127.92 \u00b1 1.44). Considering the relationship between \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 2 H (Figure 6b), stream waters had isotope values corresponding more closely to rainwater, whereas isotope signatures in surface soils (0.05 and 0.3 m) and plant water tended to deviate to the right side of the local meteoric water line (LMWL) of rainwater isotopes. This phenomenon indicates the influence of evaporation. This deviation was not observed in the deeper layer. Temporal fluctuations in soil water (Figure 6c) were greater at the surface (0.05 m) and became smaller in the deeper soil layer. The fluctuation was smallest in the deepest layer (3.0 m). Isotope values of plant water (Figure 6d) largely deviated to the right side of the LMWL and also plotted out of the range of soil water isotopes.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "Group 1 with medium isotope values that fell within or near the range of soil water isotopes (D. sublamellatus, 45 m; S. rugosum, 25 m; B. parviflora, 5 m; and M. lowii, 3 m), Group 2 with more negative plant water isotope values that were clearly out of the range of soil water isotopes (H. dictyoneurum, 12 m; D. malaccensis, 17 m; and X. stipitatum, 33 m), and Group 3 showing less negative \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 2 H values with smaller temporal fluctuations (P. caput-medusae,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": "Comparison between evapotranspiration demand (mm) and water budget in the surface soil layer (0-0.5 m, mm).

The temporal fluctuations of plant water isotope values in the first (circles) and second (triangles) groups, as can be seen from the standard deviations of plant water isotope values (\u03b4 18 O) for each species in Figure 6d, were similar in size to the temporal fluctuations in isotope values for upper layer soil water (0.05, 0.3, and 0.75 m, Figure 6c) and larger than those for deeper layer soil water (1.5 and 3.0 m). For P. caput-medusae, the temporal fluctuation was smaller and similar to those of deeper layer soil water; however, their average values were significantly different, which indicates that P. caput-medusae did not use this water. During the dry period (Figure 7a; 19 June 2013), for 30-day antecedent rainfall, most plant water isotopic contents were different from rainwater, whereas for longer (60-day) antecedent rainfalls, rainwater isotopic contents corresponded with plant and soil water, although plant water still deviated slightly from the rainwater meteoric water line, especially in the case of Group 2 species. During the very dry period (12-13 March 2014; Figure 7b), most rainwater values were larger than soil and plant water values for 60-day antecedent rainfall, and 120-day antecedent rainfall should be analysed to identify the source water for plants and soils. The isotope values of plant water became closer to those of soil water in this very dry period, and both soil and plant water (except at 3.0-m soil) deviated from the rainwater meteoric water line. The isotope values of plant water for each of the three groups can be explained by the soil water mixture. During very wet periods in the rainy season (Figure 7c; 28-29 November 2014), the soil and plant water isotopic signature corresponded with the rainwater meteoric water line for 30-day antecedent rainfall but did not fall within the range of antecedent rainfall between 31 and 60 days. Soil water at all depths did not show any deviation from rainwater. However, the plant water of Group 2 and Group 3 species showed a deviation to the right side of the LMWL. The isotope values of plant water were more negative and out of the range of soil water in Group 2 species. During the wet period at the end of the rainy season (Figure 7d; 8 January 2015), both plant and soil water corresponded relatively closely to rainwater isotope signatures in the 30-and 60day antecedent rainfall. Most water (except P. caput-medusae in Group 3) did not show any deviation from the LMWL; however, plant water from Group 2 species had more negative values and was out of the range of soil water. Isotope signals from different tree heights and species at different periods did not show any clear tendency towards a specific water uptake depth (Figure 7). Plant water isotope values were mostly deviated to the right side of the rainwater LMWL (except Groups 1 and 2 on 8 January 2015). They also differed from the values of soil water at any depth and became closer to those of soil only in the very dry period. 4 | DISCUSSION", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF9": {"text": "Isotope signatures of precipitation, stream, soil, and plant water at Pasoh Forest Reserve.

Isotope signatures are also shown in the relationship between \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 2 H for (b) rainfall, stream, soil, and plant water; (c) soil water; and (d) plant water. Plant water is depicted as circles for Group 1, triangles for Group 2, and diamonds for Group 3 predominately affected by the annual cycle of the Asian Monsoon, with defined wet and dry seasons (Tanaka et al., 2008). During the El Ni\u00f1o events in 2014-2015, the study site experienced two drought periods at the beginning of the year (February and March). It should be noted that annual ET values during the study period (2012-2015) were lower than in most normal years (1,287 \u00b1 52 mm, 2003-2009, Kosugi, Takanashi, Tani, et al., 2012). The 7-year average annual value of ET found by Kosugi, Takanashi, Tani, et al. (2012) is in a range similar to those of two Amazonian rainforests, Manaus (1,307 mm, Da Costa et al., 2010) and Santarem (1,274 mm, Da Costa et al., 2010). Another Malaysian lowland tropical rainforest, Lambir in Borneo, also showed a similar value (1,323 \u00b1 74 mm, Kume et al., 2011), which was estimated using a Penman-Monteith model parameterized with occasional EC measurements. Indonesian peat swamp forests show larger values (1,636 \u00b1 53 mm, Hirano, Kusin, Limin, & Osaki, 2015), and one half-deciduous tropical forest in Xishuangbanna,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF10": {"text": "The relationship between \u03b4 18 O (\u2030) and \u03b4 2 H (\u2030) of rainwater, soil water, and plant water for (a) 19 June 2013 (dry, antecedent precipitation index [API60] = 8), (b) 12-13 March 2014 (very dry, API60 = 0.4), (c) 28-29 November 2014 (wet, API60 = 30-42), and (d) 08 January 2015 (wet, API60 = 32).

However, the stability of ET was not greatly influenced by the amount of rainfall, because the forest transpired water even during dry periods such as in February and March in 2014 and 2015 (Figure 2c,d), although there was a moderate decrease in transpiration.

If we assume fluctuations in soil water content in the layer between 0.5 and 1.0 m were the same as those at the surface layer between 0 and 0.5 m, then an additional 50% of water supply can be explained in the case of normal dry periods such as June 2013.
