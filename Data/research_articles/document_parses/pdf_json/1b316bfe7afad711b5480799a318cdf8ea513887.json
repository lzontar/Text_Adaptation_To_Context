The large number of people infected with the virus combined with the wide spectrum of disease severity and clinical outcomes have led scientists and clinicians to investigate whether various phenotypes and baseline biomarkers are associated with a higher risk of infection and critical illness. Initial data on COVID-19 has implicated several factors associated with worse disease severity including older age and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (2, 3) . Considering the close relationship between these conditions and metabolic syndrome, characterized by insulin resistance and excess adiposity, obesity may also be a risk factor for worse clinical outcomes.",

There are also emerging data that obesity is an independent predictor of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and death (5) (6) (7) , and in a recent report from a large cohort of COVID-19 patients in New York obesity was found to be one of the most common associated comorbidities in hospitalized patients (8) . The underlying impairments in the cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and thrombotic pathways that characterize COVID-19, combined with the immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation seen in obesity, may potentiate critical illness (9-11). Often the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 causes more clinical complications than the direct viral cytopathic injury alone, with development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac injury, thromboembolic disease, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) Some estimates have suggested that almost 50% of adults in the United States are at increased risk for complications from COVID-19 due to chronic health conditions, even without considering the role of obesity (20) . Given the high prevalence of obesity in western countries, whether obesity confers an additional risk to patients with COVID-19 must be delineated.

Similar findings are described in obese patients infected with the H1N1 influenza virus, where weight impacted risk for hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and death, independent of other comorbidities (15, 24, 25) ]. The adverse respiratory outcomes seen in COVID-19 and other respiratory infections are thought to be a result of a systemic inflammatory response, which is initiated by activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes into T helper 1 cells that generate cytokines. These cytokines then induce CD14+ and CD16+ inflammatory monocytes to produce IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\uf061 and other proinflammatory factors, triggering a cytokine storm (26, 27) . The consequences of the aforementioned syndrome include apoptosis, vascular leakage, impaired viral clearance, altered tissue homeostasis, acute lung injury, cardiac dysfunction, and ultimately acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (28) . As a result, elevated biomarkers of inflammation such as ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and C-reactive protein have been seen in severe COVID-19 (29, 30) . One link to obesity's impact on COVID-19 disease severity could be the underlying low-grade chronic inflammatory state which includes elevation of the same key inflammatory markers that are implicated in the cytokine storm. Although these inflammatory markers are typically elevated among all weight groups as seen in our study, the already existing chronic subclinical inflammatory state in obese patients may further exacerbate COVID-19 disease severity (31, 32) .",

The inflammation, platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction seen in COVID-19 also Accepted Article predispose patients to thrombotic disease, both in the venous and arterial circulation (33) . Although not evaluated directly in our study, thrombotic disease such as pulmonary embolism is thought to be another manifestation of severe disease and contributes to the need for ICU admission and increase in mortality. In obesity, enhanced rates of thrombosis secondary to elevated expression of prothrombotic molecules and increased platelet activation are commonly reported (34) . This prothrombotic state may predispose obese patients with COVID-19 to experience thrombotic events associated with increased severity of disease and poor prognosis (10) . Finally, elevated BMI has damaging effects on lung function, diminishing forced expiratory volume and forced vital capacity (9). The change in respiratory mechanics directly affects a patient's ability to maintain adequate oxygenation. Importantly, our study supports this hypothesis with higher rates of OSA and chronic pulmonary disease in patients with obesity and higher rates of cough and dyspnea as presenting symptoms compared to non-obese patients, as probable mediators of the adverse effects of obesity on outcomes.",

This suggests that these diseases could be conferring risk of poor outcomes independent of BMI per se. These findings regarding the association of obesity with worse respiratory mechanics and chronic respiratory diseases, in addition to elevated inflammatory markers regardless of BMI category in our study are interesting. Although the aforementioned important association of obesity with an inflammatory state especially in presence of insulin resistance should be considered, our results suggest that it might be the obesity itself and its effect on lung function, and not the associated insulin resistance and inflammation, which are the main driver of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. This is a potentially important distinction which merits further studies.",
