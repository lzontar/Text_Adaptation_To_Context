The index measures the users' engagement through interactive behaviors: number of likes, comments and shares of a post, which define the three main dimensions of the indicator: popularity (P), commitment (C) and virality (V). Different software programs are available for social-media data gathering and quantitative analysis; others are designed to analyze the data from a linguistic point of view, specifically regarding content and emotions [62] . Despite the existence of these, the authors and their research group have developed an ad hoc tool (called \"Facebook data model\") for this type of research, based on Microsoft technology and previously tested and used in other studies [45, 63] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 30, "end": 34, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 35, "end": 38, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 497, "end": 501, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 948, "end": 952, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1194, "text": "[45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1198, "text": "63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 429, "end": 437, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Methodology"}, {"text": "This tool (Figure 1 ) consists of four modules: (1) the extraction module is responsible for retrieving data available from Facebook pages using queries to the Facebook Graph API (application programming interface) based on Power Query M language, (2) the analysis module, developed on Power Business Intelligence (business intelligence tool based on Microsoft's productivity cloud that allows us to unite different data sources), uses data analysis expressions (DAX language) for developing a star analytic model for the multidimensional exploitation of extracted information, calculating the different items defined in this study, (3) data visualization module uses Microsoft Power View technology to carry out the graphical representation of the results to allow a dynamic analysis of the information (4) and the content analysis module, based on Learning Machine technology, analyses and classifies data into different topics previously parameterized based on a preliminary analysis that helped to define the categories according to the content of the posts of Facebook pages.

Specifically, the video format has a significant effect, perhaps for being especially appropriate for health communication [54] , although the photo format is the most recurrent [24, 25] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 397, "end": 401, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 402, "end": 405, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 558, "end": 562, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 563, "end": 566, "text": "65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 797, "end": 801, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 852, "end": 856, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 857, "end": 860, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Determinants of the Level of Users' Engagement via Facebook"}, {"text": "Finally, the findings regarding the variable \"type of content\" confirm H6, albeit with some nuances. Of the five topic categories under which the contents of the posts were classified, only one, related to the dissemination of scientific knowledge developed in fields such as cancer, vaccines, new drugs or results of different medical studies, positively influences the level of online engagement with HOs. In this sense, the HOs analyzed take advantage of the interactive potential of controversial health topics to generate debate [55, 58] , in order to attract the user and trigger a reaction which leads them to engage with the organization. Another interesting finding is that posts related to health promotion have a greater specific weight in the classification of topics [23] . However, they do not have a significant effect on the users' commitment, contradicting the results of [25] , who associate the highest participation rates with health educational posts. This could be due to the fact that this is the content that users expect to find in HOs' social networks, not finding it relevant and are therefore not motivated to engage in further interaction beyond the initial access to the information. Therefore, HOs must take special care in the content disclosed, in that it must be relevant to the user [59] , and should move away from informative content to promote the organization, since users can perceive that this type of posts focus more on the interest of the organization than on the public interest [14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 534, "end": 538, "text": "[55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 539, "end": 542, "text": "58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 780, "end": 784, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 889, "end": 893, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1322, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1528, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Determinants of the Level of Users' Engagement via Facebook"}, {"text": "Social networks provide health communication with multiple benefits for users/patients and health organizations alike. Social media allow HOs to create an innovative and bidirectional communication channel between doctors, patients and the researchers, through which users' increasing demand for information and participation on health-related issues can be met. From an organizational standpoint, embedding social media into the HO\u00b4s communication strategies can help these organizations to increase their visibility in the market, strengthen their corporate image and strategic position and reach their target audience. Therefore, and in line with previous literature, improving the effectiveness of health communication should involve encouraging user participation in HOs' social networks.

Our findings show that HOs could improve their users' engagement by encouraging them to express their feelings, opinions or concerns through \"comments\" and posting information through attractive, visually rich and interactive formats (such as videos). Furthermore, users show great interest in content related to scientific knowledge, especially regarding controversial topics (such as vaccinations or new drugs) or topics in which there is a particular social awareness (i.e., cancer), urgency or lack of knowledge (such as the Ebola epidemic in 2014-2016 or the recent COVID-19 pandemic thread in 2020). HOs may also be missing opportunities to connect with their audience, since the hours and days of posting are not optimally exploited. HOs should reschedule both the posting day and the time of the day beyond business days or hours. In this regard, technological advances could help in this task, programming the content publication at a time that is more likely to generate user interaction, such as evening hours and during the weekend. This combined strategy could allow HOs to reach a wider audience and to achieve higher levels of engagement, disseminating health related information in a simple but effective way, and meeting the user's needs for knowledge and the establishment of bidirectional communication with health experts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Although the topic, format and timing variables behave similarly throughout the whole sample, some organizational differences arise. The results show that public entities are more efficient in managing their online communication strategy than their private counterparts and that the largest HOs exhibit better results in terms of engagement. These results point out that public and larger HOs are much more aware of the resources they have at their disposal to disseminate information and engage their users, generating value without increasing their costs. Furthermore, users living in poorer regions are more involved with HOs, so it is possible that they may be missing an opportunity by not connecting with large audiences in more affluent regions, which are critically important for private HOs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Our findings contribute to the existing theories mentioned in the literature review. According to the Dialogic Communication Theory, social media are a valuable channel for health communication, especially in less favored areas in view of the greater commitment they exhibit with HOs. Regarding Resource Dependence Theory, smaller HOs should take advantage of the interactive potential offered by social media to reduce uncertainty and resource dependence, due to the optimal relationship between assuming lower costs of implementation and maintenance and reaching a wider audience. Pertaining to Media Richness Theory, our findings support the view that not all formats present the same level of engagement, with video and photos having a greater impact on users' engagement. Finally, it is also worth noting the relevance of the Uses and Gratifications Theory, since the findings of our research confirm that, in order to be effective, HOs should ensure that posts are relevant and in line with users' interests.

For those involved in the management of HOs, the benefits offered by social media to improve relations with their users are highlighted, and concrete actions and recommendations that HOs can follow at the organizational level and with respect to their communication policy are included.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Despite its findings, this work has some limitations, such as the selection of hospital, clinic and healthcare organizations and the limited study period of one year. Furthermore, the treatment of photo-based posts has represented an added difficulty, and data downloaded with the Facebook API depends on the organization's privacy settings and some explicative factors that have not been considered. These limitations could be overcome in future research and lead to new studies. It would be interesting to carry out research in areas where the health system is not as well considered, as in the case of underdeveloped countries, in order to establish a comparison that would help to address possible deficiencies in health communication in the latter. In addition, new research delimiting the medical specialty of the organization and the organization\u00b4s reputation, as well as analyzing other actors involved in health communication, would help to understand the social media phenomenon. Similarly, other factors in addition to those considered in this study would be interesting to explore, such as the sentiment of messages or a specific analysis of the audiovisual content posted by the organization. Likewise, with the aim of contributing to an expansion and enrichment of the current literature on this topic, a more in-depth content analysis could be performed by applying different emotion lexicon or by establishing a classification criterion of topics based on the preferences of Facebook users identified through a previous survey.
