Reported rates of intensive care (ICU) admission vary between 19 to 32%. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Early ARF usually peaks by 8 days after symptom onset. 1, 2 But can be delayed with a protracted course. 2 In the ICU, mortality rates similar to or lower than those reported for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 7 have been reported. 1, 5 The following recommendations on the ventilatory and ICU management of SARS are based on published data as well as our local experience. 1 Patients who meet the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, defined by PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264 200 mmHg) should be cared for in an ICU. Depending on availability, observation in a high dependency (HDU) setting or ICU is indicated in those who meet the criteria for acute lung injury ((ALI), defined by PaO 2 /FiO 2 > 200-300 mmHg, or in those who presented with tachypnoea (respiratory rate > 30/min) and more than 50% progression of chest (bilateral or multilobular) shadows within 48 hours.) 8 2 Patients who develop signs of sepsis, septic shock or multiorgan failure. As SARS is characteristically accompanied by single organ (respiratory) failure 1 multiorgan failure is usually a result of superimposed hospital-acquired bacterial infection.",

Since physical activity or even coughing may result in severe desaturation, sufficient sedation during early mechanical ventilation is useful to eliminate anxiety, thus improving pulmonary oxygenation. 21 A high rate of barotrauma (34%) had been reported, 1 again highlighting the need to avoid excessive volumes and pressures. Permissive hypercapnia resulting from cautious ventilator management necessitated shortterm neuromuscular blockade in 52-70% of ventilated cases. 1,2 Other ventilator modes used include airway pressure release ventilation and high frequency oscillatory ventilation but results have not been reported. 2 Apart from barotrauma, common complications of mechanical ventilation include ventilator-associated pneumonia, acute renal failure, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. 2 Low baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios and high APACHE II scores were the only predictors for protracted ARDS and death in one study. 2 ICU mortality rates were high: 34-53% at 28 days, when some patients were still being ventilated. 1,2 To improve survival, research is required to identify early all SARS patients who may progress to severe ARDS and to develop effective treatment.",

The duration of manual ventilation during resuscitation procedures should be reduced to a minimum. Endotracheal intubation should be performed by the most skilled person available 22 using rapid sequence induction: risk of aerosol generation is lowest when the patient is paralysed. All special precautions for ICU patients must be complied with. Contrary to recommendations to avoid NIV and nebulised therapy, 22 NIV has not been reported to be associated with increased infection risk for HCW, and doubts have been raised about the role of nebulised treatment on the spread of SARS within the hospital. 24 On the other hand, it is always prudent to limit opportunities for HCW exposure and to perform aerosol generating procedures in an airborne isolation environment. 25 In addition to ensuring the safety of HCWs, timely psychological support is critical to maintain staff morale. 2 The above strategies had been effective in preventing infection in ICU HCWs in hospitals in Singapore 2 and Hong Kong, and in the latter case over 80 HCWs exposed to NIV and mechanical ventilation of SARS patients were proved to be serologically negative for SARS-CoV after the outbreak (unpubl. data, 2003). for connection to exhalation port of ventilator.
