            "text": "COVID-19 is primarily spread via small droplets generated during a cough or sneeze. However, certain procedures, such as intubation, increase the risk of aerosolizing large quantities of small and micro particles that are highly infectious and increase the risk to nearby providers. Worldwide efforts to develop personal protective equipment (PPE) for front line providers performing endotracheal intubation during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to innovative devices such as the intubation box [1] , [2] . While this barrier has been shown to limit macroscopic contamination on the laryngoscopist, there is still concern for viral exposure through aerosolization of microscopic particles in several clinical settings. There is even greater concern for exposure in prehospital and emergency department settings where multiple providers may be simultaneously engaged in resuscitation efforts. This risk potentially threatens providers within 2 or more meters of the source and smaller aerosolized particles, with diameter less than 8\u00b5m, may remain airborne for greater than 30 minutes [3] . During resuscitation procedures in these settings providers on the resuscitation team are in contact with or in close proximity to the patient for tasks such as chest compressions or assisting with airway management [4] . Thus, a solution protecting all providers on the resuscitation team from macroscopic contamination, as well as aerosolized microscopic viral particles, would be of benefit. This article introduces a novel protective barrier and assesses its ability to contain aerosolized mist compared with the intubation box and no protective barrier [1] .",

The PCB has a 'C' shaped base (Fig. 2 ) allowing it to slide under the mattress of effectively any type of bed or stretcher, agnostic to bed size. As in the figure, the drape is attached to the boundary of the PCB and flows seamlessly over the patients torso and lower extremities, creating a protective barrier even during chest compressions.

For each trial, a laryngoscopist stood at the head of the bed and reenacted a standard intubation on the mannequin. To simulate the spread of aerosolized particles a commercial fog machine (Hurricane 700, ChauvetDJ, Inc) was placed next to the head of the mannequin (Fig. 1) . The fog generating mixture is a combination of water, triethylene glycol, and 1,2-propylene glycol (Bog Fog, Froggy's Fog, Inc). Fog includes particles with diameters ranging from 0.1-200\u00b5m [11] . A small container designed with a superior opening was placed over the outlet of the fog machine to direct the fog superiorly, thus simulating the vector of egress from the patient's mouth. The container captured large droplets, resulting in condensation within the container, and the remaining mist exited through the superior opening. During each trial the fog machine was activated for 30 seconds. The experiment was performed serially with 1) no protective barrier, 2) an intubation box, and 3) the authors' IACS (Fig. 1) . In a single additional trial the capture container was removed during fog machine activation to further illustrate containment within the IACS (Video 2). Each trial was video recorded on an Apple iPhone XR with approximately 15 minutes between trials to allow fog to clear. Post processing of trial videos was performed on commercial video software (iMovie, Apple, Inc) and included cropping and applying a grey-scale color inversion filter to improve visualization of mist. Each trial video was synched to demonstrate similar periods of aerosolization over time (Video 1).",

Additionally, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) requires close contact with the patient to perform chest compressions, airway support and other life saving measures, depending on the circumstances.

Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 is associated with high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and remains viable in aerosols for over an hour [6] , [7] . Analysis of environmental samples in a biocontainment quarantine unit found evidence of diffuse environmental COVID-19 contamination including 66.7% of hallway air samples and 100% of in-room air samples [8] . Furthermore, COVID-19 is demonstrated to transmit even in asymptomatic carriers who may present for care due to other medical conditions or trauma [9] . The PPE donned by providers is critical, however, it may not provide adequate protection from large droplets or smaller aerosolized particles. Even with adequate PPE, emergency room providers were infected during the SARS coronavirus outbreak suggesting that masks alone do not prevent acquisition from environmental contamination [10] . Thus, there is a critical need for additional measures to protect healthcare providers during resuscitation and airway management. Such a solution must provide protection from aerosolized particles while allowing adequate exposure and contact with the patient to permit ongoing chest compressions, bag valve mask oxygenation, effective placement of an airway endotracheal tube, confirmation of tube placement and connection to a ventilator.",

In addition to present results suggesting improved protection from aerosolized particles, the IACS improves access to the patient for resuscitation team members. During resuscitation simulations, providers specifically noted limited patient access for resuscitation tasks when utilizing the intubation box. Using the IACS access was improved for tasks including providing airway assistance, suctioning, performing chest compressions and managing other injuries.

Future work will include further refinement and validation of the design to improve visualization of the patient and access by assisting providers. Further study is necessary, including prospective controlled clinical studies, to adequately assess the clinical significance of employing additional protective measures beyond standard PPE. Future efforts will explore safety considerations for IACS use. This includes assessing oxygenation and determining safe time limits within the IACS. Currently we recommend continuous clinical supervision within IACS and use only during resuscitation efforts or when mechanical ventilation is established. In addition, efforts will assess procedures for safely discarding potential contaminants within the IACS after resuscitation is complete to further minimize the likelihood of environmental contamination and infection transmission.",
