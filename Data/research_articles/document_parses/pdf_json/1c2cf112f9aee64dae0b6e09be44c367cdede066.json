The absolute risks of these communities and individuals, however, heavily depend on the underlying local characteristics of the epidemic driven by key factors such as population density, mobility patterns and social distancing. Estimates available based on excess death, for example, indicate a mortality rate for the NYC from COVID-19 about 283 per 100K individuals during the period of March 13-May 2 27,28 . According to our estimate, the rate of death in the high-risk group (>5-fold) is expected to be about 1620 per 100K individuals. Now, consider a hypothetical scenario where the pandemic returns with double its intensity later this year. Thus, over a similar period of time, such a resurgence will lead to a death rate due to COVID-19 of 566 and 3240 per 100K individuals, in the overall city and in the high-risk group, respectively. The increase in absolute risk due to doubling the intensity of the pandemic in these two groups will be 283 vs 1620 per 100K individuals, indicating a much more adverse impact on the individuals in the high-risk group.

We evaluate the Index of Excess Risk for COVID-19 (IER-C19) mortality, a measure of aggregated risk in a locality associated with the prevalence of the underlying factors (Figure 1). We observe an almost 8-fold risk ratio between the highest and the lowest ranked city according to this index. Five cities with the highest values of the index are Hemet (CA), Detroit (MI), Youngstown (OH), Shreveport (LA) and Deerfield Beach (FL), and five cities with the lowest values of the index are Provo (UT), Frisco (TX), Fishers (IN), West Jordan (UT) and Allen (TX). A number of large cities in the US east coast tend to rank high in this index. Notably, Detroit and Ann Arbor, two cities only separated by 43.4 miles within Michigan, rank in the two extremes with almost 4-fold difference in average risk. The proportion of individuals in different risk categories varies widely across cities (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 6, Supplementary Table 1). Our analysis identifies 93 cities which have at least 5% of individuals at high-risk category (>5-fold risk). These same cities have at least 14.2% and 1.6% of individuals who could be classified at elevated (>2-fold) and very-high (>10-fold) risk groups. The number of individuals in the high-risk categories depends heavily on the underlying population sizes. In the New York City, we estimate that there are 1228K, 413K and 139K individuals who exceed these risk-thresholds for elevated, high and very high-risk categories. A number of other major population centers, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, San Antonio and Detroit, have at least 64K people, in each city, who can be classified at the >5-fold risk category. The number of individuals who are in the elevated-and very-high-risk categories across these cities varies in the range of 150K-517K and 27K-53K, respectively. Our analysis also identifies 78 cities which have less than 2% of individuals in the high-risk category (>5-fold).
