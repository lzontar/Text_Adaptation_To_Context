It offers the prospect of mutual advantages for developing and emerging countries as well as a stronger voice in global diplomacy on social and economic issues. This chapter sets out to provide a balanced view of opportunities and challenges of South-South cooperation , outlining pertinent questions that emerge from this new dynamic of global governance. In the following sections, we brie fl y outline the history of South-South cooperation and describe its main mechanism and its application to health. We then discuss the paradigm shift from the former bipolar system during the Cold War to today's global multipolar system. We demonstrate how the consolidation of multipolarity is particularly re fl ected in the (re)formation of regional blocks, notably in terms of their spheres of coordination and their engagement in different South-South cooperation mechanisms. The African Union (AU), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR in its of fi cial Spanish acronym) serve as key examples to illustrate both the current state of South-South cooperation and emerging challenges that need to be addressed if South-South cooperation is to be effective and viable in the long term.",

While attention is increasingly paid to this model, the origins of development cooperation among developing countries can be traced back to the 1950s. At that time, South-South cooperation was an innovative practice established to foster economic cooperation among developing countries; it was in fl uenced by an international system whose structures were shaped by the logic of the Cold War and growing independence movements in colonized developing countries. The two dynamics had a profound impact on the key rationale of South-South cooperation , primarily founded on the concepts and practices of \"internationalist solidarity\" of socialist countries. These countries portrayed South-South cooperation as \"a mechanism through which countries of the (developing world) would be enabled to overcome dependence on the industrialized nations\" (De la Fontaine and Seifert 2010 , p. 2). Whereas South-South cooperation has a long history, it is only in this new millennium that we see an unprecedented upsurge of South-South cooperation on national, regional and global levels, and especially in the realm of global health governance ( United Nations Economic and Social Council 2008 ) .",

The same group agreed to establish the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) at the Belgrade Conference in 1961. Most of the NAM members also formed part of the Group 77 (G77), which was subsequently established in 1964, that actively sought to integrate South-South cooperation into its agenda to \"promote developing countries' interests in support of a proposed New International Economic Order\" (Cabral and Weinstock 2010 , p. 24) . The call for the Box 1 The Ten Principles of Bandung (the Asian-African Conference, Bandung, 18-24 April 1955 ) 1. Respect for fundamental human rights and for the purposes and principles of the charter of the United Nations. 2. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations. 3. Recognition of the equality of all races and of the equality of all nations large and small. 4. Abstention from intervention or interference in the internal affairs of another country. 5. Respect for the right of each nation to defend itself singly or collectively, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. 6. (a) Abstention from the use of arrangements of collective defence to serve any particular interests of the big powers. (b) Abstention by any country form exerting pressures on other countries. 7. Refraining from acts or threats of aggression of the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any country. 8. Settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means, such as negotiation, conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement as well as other peaceful means of the parties own choice, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. 9. Promotion of mutual interest and cooperation. 10. Respect for justice and international obligations. revision of the dominant international economic system represented a culmination of the joint efforts of developing countries to overcome economic dependency and inequality that were-in the view of the developing countries-manifested in the Bretton Woods System. With these different Southern alliances, the basic framework for the development of political consensuses between developing countries was established . Their agglomerated in fl uence played a critical role in the establishment of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1964. Following these developments, the United Nations General Assembly in 1972 initiated a Working Group on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (TCDC). In 1978, the United Nations Conference on TCDC, held in Buenos Aires, set another essential landmark in recognizing TCDC as an essential part of South-South cooperation . The Plan provided the conceptual basis and a practical guide for realizing the objectives that TCDC aimed to achieve ( SU-SSC-UNDP 2010 ) . Six years later it was institutionally supported by the UN Special Unit for South-South cooperation , whose mandate to this day is \"to promote, coordinate and support South-South and triangular cooperation on a Global and United Nations systems-wide basis\" ( SSC-UNDP 2010 ) . The establishment of this UN division re fl ected the increasing importance the UN gave to South-South cooperation . In 1987, the NAM convened a summit at which the South Commission was launched and which was later to become famous for its 1990 report \"The Challenge to the South\". This highly cited work assessed the South's achievements and failings in development and suggested directions for action, in particular with regards to how exactly developing countries could bene fi t from globalization. The report was critical in trying to establish a more pragmatic view on fostering more development within the South, elaborating how developing countries could in practice bene fi t from emerging global interdependencies.",

The bulk of Southern actors-particularly a large number of rising states -still claim to respect and apply the Bandung Principles. What has changed is that the early period of South-South cooperation primarily focused on the promotion of economic development, while the policy area of health was at best considered at the margins of Southern development cooperation. However, in but more recent years, approaches to international cooperation in health have evolved. This subsequent integration of policy issues that went beyond the initial primary objective of furthering economic development occurred gradually over time and through the evolutionary establishment of new institutions and/or strategies focusing on speci fi c aspects of South-South cooperation . Thus, while South-South cooperation had been increasingly pursued since the 1950s, it was only since the mid-1970s that the Southern countries started to pay more attention to the component of health in their development cooperation schemes. By 1976, health representatives and coordinators from the non-aligned and developing countries met regularly to develop and discuss their activities in the fi eld of health cooperation (Research Centre for Cooperation with Developing Countries 1987 , p. 11).",

            "text": "The end of the Cold War marked a turning point, not only for collective action in the area of health, but also for South-South cooperation in general. Developing countries' movements suffered a serious political setback in the context of the end of the bipolar world. A number of developing countries were dealing with fi nancial crises that forced them to approach the Bretton Woods institutions for assistance, \"which generally came with the conditionality of binding them fi rmly with the Washington Consensus\" (Kumar 2008 , p. 2) . Developing countries became progressively interwoven into an increasingly complex international system, but in heterogeneous ways. The consequence for the formerly rather united stance of Southern countries, based on common objectives critical of the developed world, was suddenly no longer shared by all developing countries. Yet, despite these substantial changes, the interest of developing countries in engaging in new ways in South-South cooperation was not extinct and was revived with an unprecedented enthusiasm as the dynamics of globalization became apparent in the twenty-fi rst century. The new zeal of Southern countries also captured a vivid interest in development cooperation in areas that previously had been of less interest to these countries. Health now received unprecedented levels of attention in Southern development agendas, a trend that also re fl ects the power shift of health as it gained recognition as an issue of global concern (Alcazar 2008 ) . Global health , due to its complex character that touches many governance levels and policy fi elds (e.g. trade, security, development), has been the focus of a plethora of development initiatives. Many of these still follow the traditional logic of the \"rich\" industrialized countries seeking to help the \"poor\" developing countries. But this long-standing dichotomy is changing remarkably in today's world where a considerable number of those countries formerly regarded as \"poor\" or \"third world\" have become new regional and global centres of power and in fl uence, both economically and politically (see Khanna 2008 ; Kickbusch 2009 ; Alexandroff and Cooper 2010 ) . South-South cooperation is reviving to match these geopolitical power shift s, to generate better development outcomes for all the partners involved.",

All these actors from the industrialized countries have been keen to help poor people in \"recipient\" countries; despite having the best intentions to help poor populations in the poorest countries in the world, very often these actors impose their own world views, agendas and prede fi ned objectives. On the other hand, some developing countries are frequently seen as unable to organize their national demands, given the lack of coordination between Ministries of Health, Foreign Affairs and other key public and private institutions. As a result of both situations, developing countries often suffer from the highly fragmented and ineffective use of the limited resources available (Buss 2007 (Buss , 2008a .",

This range of cooperative tools stands in contrast to traditional South-South cooperation projects in health, which had been mainly driven by ideological reasons (e.g. China, Cuba, Soviet Republic), whose main South-South cooperation activities consisted of the dispatch of medical personnel to developing countries or graduate training of thousands of health professionals (Feinsilver 2008 ; see Huang 2010 ) . Today we can observe an enlarged scope of development cooperation mechanisms re fl ecting South-South cooperation of a pragmatic nature, with partners seeking to foster economic, political and social objectives. Currently about 20 % of development assistance from Southern contributors-especially from rising states , such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia or South Africa-has been allocated to the health and education sectors in developing countries (Chahoud 2008 ; United Nations Economic and Social Council 2008 ) . And yet, although a growth can be observed in the acknowledgement of health within South-South cooperation , it is striking that relatively little literature has been published that speci fi cally focuses on South-South health cooperation. While Brazil has recently published academic articles that sketch out how the country understands and implements its guiding concept of \"structuring cooperation for health\" (Buss 2011 ; Almeida et al. 2010 ) , only a few historical and mostly descriptive narratives have been published that broach the issue of South-South health cooperation (see: Ruger and Ny 2010 ; Bliss 2010 ; Huang 2010 ) .",

On the other hand, the academic disciplines with a less emphasis on economics fi nd it hard to work with such con fi ned terms. In the social sciences, the most popular attempt so far has been to de fi ne these countries as \" rising states \". As Alexandroff and Cooper ( 2010 ) suggest, the term \"rising state\" does not deny the distinctive economic characteristics of these countries but speci fi cally focuses on socioeconomic and political features. Khanna ( 2008 ) has offered to de fi ne these states as second world countries. This term was formerly used to describe socialist countries during the Cold War, but today's second world countries are de fi ned by their common hybrid nature, in that they are both, rich and poor, developed and underdeveloped, post-modern and pre-modern, cosmopolitan and tribal, all at the same time. Such conceptualizations account more accurately for the hybrid realities and the countries' individual experience of self-development, which, these countries suggest, gives them greater insight and legitimacy as partners than countries from the industrialized world.",

ASEAN member states suddenly had to go beyond their traditional security concepts and consider their response to human security issues (Curley and Thomas 2004 ) . ASEAN responded to the daunting SARS epidemic through a number of high-level meetings and several action points to confront the global public health threat, including the ASEAN + 3 (ASEAN plus China, Japan, South Korea) Ministers of Health Special Meeting on SARS, or the Special ASEAN Leader's Meeting on SARS, which also included the non-member states China, Japan and South Korea, as well as the Hong Kong region of China.",

To guide the achievement of the strategic objectives set out in the Blueprint, the member states agreed to establish the ASEAN Strategic Framework on Health and Development (2010-2015) (Association of South-East Nations 2011 ). This policy reaf fi rms ASEAN's vision of \"Healthy ASEAN 2020\" adopted at the 5th ASEAN Health Ministers Meeting, which was held in April 2000 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. It promoted the vision that by 2020 \"health shall be at the centre of development and ASEAN cooperation in health shall be strengthened to ensure that our peoples are healthy in mind and body, and living in harmony in safe environments\" (ASEAN 2010 ) . In addition, various ASEAN Working Groups on Health Cooperation have been set up and tailored ASEAN Health Programmes are planned that focus on capacity-building activities, including institutional capacity, laboratories, surveillance, preparedness and rapid response. All these actions are in pursuance of the strategic objectives of health development in ASEAN, including the enhancement of food security and safety, and ensuring access to adequate and affordable healthcare, medical services and medicine, and to promote healthy lifestyles (ASCC Blueprint, 2009 : B3, B4) .",

Scholarly literature has so far been rather loath to identify and analyse ASEAN's different policies and instruments of health cooperation. In an academic account on challenges emerging from state sovereignty and its implications for global health governance in Asia, scholars have suggested that \"ASEAN's historic strength as a regional organisation lies in its commitment to political stability, which has been informed by the norm of non-interference by member states. Yet this norm is also its inherent weakness when forced to confront threats to public health rooted in poor governance by the organisation's members\" (Stevenson and Cooper 2009 , p. 1390) .

As a result, the organization covers health amongst a vast range of other issues that fall under these broad objectives. AU-agreements on health include: the Abuja Declaration (2001) calling for its 53 Member States to allocate 15 % their national budgets to health; the Abuja Summit on HIV/AIDS in 2005 to reaf fi rm that commitment; the AUC Strategic Framework 2005-2007, or the Maputo Declaration on Strengthening of Laboratory Systems (2008). One of the recent health milestones has been the Africa Health Strategy 2007-2015 that addresses the main challenges faced by African health systems and outlines a broad strategic framework for African nations to achieve the health Millennium Development Goals. It thereby complements existing national and sub-regional strategic documents (African Union 2007 ) . The broader goal of this strategic document is to contribute to Africa's socio-economic development by improving the health of its people and by ensuring access to essential health care for all Africans, especially the poorest and most marginalized, by 2015. Strengthening the health systems of the African countries is particularly necessitated by the fact that many of their health systems are overwhelmed by the high disease burden and confronted with inadequate human and fi nancial resources. Funding targets both from international assistance and from AU countries themselves are being missed and re fl ect a long-time priority challenge that was already recognized in the Abuja Declaration 10 years ago, when the importance for AU member states was highlighted to give greater weight to health in the allocation of government revenues (World Health Organization 2010 ) .",

While this strategic development is admirable, it remains uncertain whether and how the causes of poverty and inequity will be addressed by the AU/NEPAD members in the future (see Labont\u00e9 et al. 2004 ) . Despite the numerous pledges and discourses that have emerged around health as a prerequisite to the achievement of sustainable development for Africa, tangible evidence of results is still lacking.

At that time, the group was known as the South American Community of Nations (CSN), but renamed on April 17, 2007, as UNASUR-the Union of South American Nations.",

While a number of rising states are increasingly becoming engaged in South-South development cooperation projects in developing countries, regional integration processes have also provided support for South-South cooperation to fl ourish in de fi ned regional spaces. Countries have adopted more integrated policy approaches to health and development in response to emerging concepts and as a product of South-South cooperation . Cross-country collaboration and regional structures usually emerged with the aim of addressing high disease burdens or to improve inadequate health systems.",

Rising states such as Brazil, Indonesia or South Africa have been notably active in this trend, while even countries without a current membership status in the most prominent regional organizations have approached such institutions in order to ensure health for its citizens, as the case of China in its closer engagement with ASEAN demonstrates. Many regional institutions have expanded their health agenda to embrace initiatives that go beyond immediate threats to health, promoting for example, structural cooperation for health through better health infrastructures. But many commitments to such initiatives still need to be implemented, so it remains dif fi cult to analyse their impact. While these developments are potentially fundamental to improving health for all, we also observe that to date there has been a lack of active civil society involvement in such initiatives (see Buss and Ferreira 2010 ) .",

According to its signatory states, foreign policy should actively seek to further health for all. South-South cooperation is undergoing an exciting revival among rising states and developing countries; it represents a new way of integrating foreign policy with health goals that promises to generate considerable socio-economic bene fi ts for the all partner countries involved. This provided the basis for several consecutive UN General Assembly Resolutions on Global Health and Foreign Policy ( http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/ N08/472/77/PDF/N0847277.pdf?OpenElement ; http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/ UNDOC/GEN/N09/468/31/PDF/N0946831.pdf?OpenElement ; http://daccess-ddsny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N10/518/24/PDF/N1051824.pdf?OpenElement ; http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N11/465/72/PDF/N1146572. pdf?OpenElement ) which were adopted during the last four years.
