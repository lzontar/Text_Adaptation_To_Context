ASTM F2588-12 specifies the standard test method (MIST) for protective clothing using human body simulation tests. MIST provides an assessment of the overall protective clothing system including the materials, seams, zippers, and other accessories. Ormond believes that the ability to detect lower levels of permeation or penetration under current standard conditions pushes analytical methods and instruments to their operating limits. Therefore, to more accurately evaluate airtight protective clothing, some changes to the standard method must be considered. Here we discuss potential approaches to make the MIST method more suitable for evaluating fully hermetic protective clothing. These methods include increasing the contact dose, changing the air sampler properties, enhancing the analytical detection limits, or any combination of these. 11 Gao et al. believe that ASTM F 2588-06 provides a detailed description of the test procedure, but does not provide specific requirements for the design of the test chamber. Based on a literature survey of existing test chambers, and a review of the current and proposed standards and test methods, cabin design requirements will depend on the test method chosen. Since the test conditions for aerosol/particle and vapor integration tests vary widely, a single chamber is unlikely to be used to test for all types of protective clothing. 12 EN943-2015 stipulates that airtight protective clothing should pass the practical performance test when worn by personnel for a testing time of 30 minutes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 932, "end": 934, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1474, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Practical performance evaluation"}, {"text": "ASTM F2668:2011 stipulates the methods for testing the effect of protective clothing on human physiological indicators.

Therefore, there is an increasing demand for PPBPC. Some biosafety laboratories have led to outbreaks owing to poor management, further increasing people's awareness of the need for risk prevention. 15 Choosing suitable protective clothing for BSL-4 laboratories is very important. K\u00fcmin et al. designed an experiment to compare models of different brands of PPBPC. Their results showed that there is no perfect product; there were positive and negative aspects of all products tested. This is also the case with the present study. 16 China has a late start in researching positive pressure biological protective equipment. Currently, completed BSL-4 laboratories have adopted imported products. Since the ''Twelfth Five-Year Plan\" period, Chinese researchers have succeeded in overcoming the main technical problems of PPBPC and have developed positive pressure PPE that meets the international standards. Wang D conducted a performance comparison between a positive pressure biological protective clothing (type B) produced in China and a suit (type A) produced abroad. Both suits exhibited a similar performance in terms of convenience, comfort, noise, and so on, and met the current operational requirements for high-level biosafety laboratories. 17 At present, PPBPC can provide a high level of protection to wearers in terms of technology. The question that remains is, how can it be widely applied to front-line rescue personnel in an outbreak? This requires national attention and multisectoral cooperation, including financial resources for supporting, training, and educating.

In 2002, EN 943-1:2002 was issued, which addressed the material utilized by and the overall protection of gas-tight protective clothing (Type 1 and Type 2), with the performance and test methods being specified in detail. In 2002, the ISO issued ISO 16602:2002, which was revised in 2007. In 2003, the CEN issued EN 14126, which regulates the performance requirements and test methods of virus protective clothing, and specifies the requirements for the viral permeability of protective clothing fabric. The ASTM published ASTM F1671-07, the updated version of which is ASTM F1671/F1671M-13, ASTM F1670-08, and ASTM F2588-12 in 2007, 2008, and 2012, respectively. In 2015, the CEN updated its standard EN 943-1:2002 and issued EN 943-1:2015.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Standards issued by the International Standards Organization relating to PPBPC.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Standard </td><td>Standard name\n</td></tr><tr><td>ISO 13688-1998 </td><td>Protective clothing-General requirements\n</td></tr><tr><td>ISO 13982-1 AMD 1-\n</td><td>Protective clothing for use against solid particulates -
