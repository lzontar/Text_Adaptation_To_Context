According to the phylogenetic relationships, coronavirus can be divided into four genera: Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. Alpha and beta genera can infect mammals, while gamma and delta genera are mostly avian coronaviruses 9 . There are seven known coronavirus that can infect humans: 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The first four viruses cause only mild minor respiratory illness. The other three strains-SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-are zoonotic and lead to severe respiratory syndrome 10-12 . Coronaviruses are the largest single positive-strand RNA viruses with a genome of 27-32 kb 13 . It is named for its corona-like appearance ( SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have strong human-to-human characteristics, which is attributed to the interaction between S protein and host cell surface receptors. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor 15, 16 , whereas MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a receptor 17 Table   1 2-8,12,15-17 . S protein is a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein whose trimers constitute the spike structure on the surface of the virus. The S protein (Fig. 1B) can be divided into two functional subunits: an N-terminal S1 domain contains signal peptide and receptor binding domain (RBD), and a C-terminal S2 domain contains fusion peptide and two heptapeptide repeats (HR1 and HR2) to facilitate viral fusion. RBD mediates the binding of virus and cell receptor, which then triggers a conformational change of the S protein, exposing HR1 and HR2 to form a 6-helix bundle fusion core structure, further leading to membrane fusion and viral RNA release [18] [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, S protein carries B-cell epitopes, which induces the body to produce neutralizing antibody and provides immune protection 22 . Because the S protein is involved in viral infection and is responsible for inducing host immune response and virus-neutralizing antibodies, it has been considered a key target for vaccine design.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 256, "end": 257, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 554, "end": 561, "text": "10-12 .", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 653, "end": 655, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 957, "end": 960, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 961, "end": 963, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1054, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1065, "end": 1079, "text": "2-8,12,15-17 .", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1728, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1733, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1738, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1743, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1881, "end": 1883, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1055, "end": 1064, "text": "Table   1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1232, "text": "(Fig. 1B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF18"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Antigen-specific targets of S protein include full-length S protein, S1 subunits, RBD and S2 subunits.

Vaccines based on RBD elicited a robust protective immune response and neutralizing antibodies. At the same time, RBD does not contain non-neutralizing epitopes that may cause harmful immune responses, which is a hot spot for CoV vaccine development. It is worth mentioning that RBD has relatively low immunogenicity and often requires repeated doses and adjuvants [29] [30] [31] . Because the S2 subunit is highly conserved and not prone to mutation, S2 region has become an important target for the development of protective vaccines. However, reports regarding the presence of neutralizing epitopes in S2 and a protective role for antibodies to S2 have been inconsistent. Several studies demonstrated that S2 domain could induce specific cellular immune response and a high level of total IgG but little neutralizing antibodies against coronavirus infection 32, 33 .

N protein forms a helical capsid, which locates inside the viral membrane to protect viral RNA.

Production of high titer neutralizing antibodies can block MERS-CoV replication in the lungs of vaccinated mice (Fig. 2), confirming the importance of neutralizing antibody in fighting virus infection 42 . Similarly, the importance of T-cell responses against CoV infections was also highlighted in many studies 43-46 . For example, depletion of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in mice prior to challenge by SARS-CoV resulted in decreased survival rates to 35% and 45%, respectively (Fig. 3) 45 . Interestingly, virus-specific memory T cells but not neutralizing antibodies could be detected 6 years after infection in SARS survivors, suggesting memory T cell responses may provide broad and long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection 46 . In general, both neutralizing antibody levels and T cell responses should be considered in current CoV vaccination strategies. No CoV vaccine is currently approved for use in humans. Most of the currently developed CoV vaccines are in the preclinical stage. In addition to the traditional inactivated and attenuated live vaccines, other development of candidate CoV vaccines was mainly focused on the S protein of coronaviruses. These types of S protein-based vaccines include nucleic acid-, viral vector-, virus-like particle (VLPs) and subunit vaccines.

However, eosinophil infiltration in the lungs of animals vaccinated with inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine or MERS-CoV vaccine has raised concerns about the safety and ultimate protective efficacy of inactivated vaccine 50,51 . In addition, a double-inactivated SARS-CoV (doubly inactivated by formalin and UV irradiation) vaccine provides poor protection against lethal disease in aged-animal models following heterologous challenge 52 . This result may be attributed to respiratory dendritic cells (rDCs) migration to draining lymph nodes (DLNs) progressively decreases as mice age, decreases in virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses in lungs and more severe disease in older mice infected with SARS-CoV 53,54 . Based on the above results, candidate vaccines against emerging coronaviruses should emphasize the efficacy in older animal with virus infection. The live-attenuated virus vaccine, composed of recombinant SARS-CoV lacking the E gene (rSARS-Cov-E), produces significant neutralizing antibodies and virus-specific T cell responses 55,56 .

However, some viral-vectors, such as certain serotypes of adenoviruses, may fail to induce effective immune responses owing to the high prevalence of virus-neutralizing antibodies in the human population resulting in elimination of viral vectors 77 .

The other chimeric VLPs, expressing SARS-CoV S protein and influenza M1 protein, can induce neutralizing antibodies and protect mice against deadly challenges 79 . Similar as SARS-CoV VLP vaccines that induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies against CoV infection, MERS-CoV VLP vaccines also elicit antigen specific cellular immune response against infections of MERS-CoV 80 . The VLP vaccine is a potential tool to provide protection against novel pandemic pathogens. However, VLPs as a preventive vaccine still have many problems to be considered.

Therefore, RBD-based subunit vaccines not only can induce effective neutralizing antibodies, but also avoid adverse immune responses.From the safety and effectiveness perspectives, the RBD-based CoV vaccines are more attractive candidates in the development of CoV vaccines. Since the SARS and MERS outbreaks, subunit vaccines based on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBD have been extensively studied and tested, showing sufficient effectiveness and strong protection against CoV infection in various animal models 81-85 . For example, RBD-Fc (RBD fused with human IgG1 Fc) elicits long-term humoral immune response, and produces neutralizing antibodies that protects the vaccinated mice from the SARS-CoV challenge without causing immunopathological damage 81 . Also, a newly designed RBD without the Fc tag induces robust humoral and T cell responses, particularly neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice, protecting mice against SARS-CoV infection 82 . It has been demonstrated that S377-588-Fc, which is a fusion protein of RBD fragment S377-588 (spike residues 377-588) and human IgG1 Fc, induces the higher-titer IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies among all RBD fragments in mice 83 . A study has also shown that i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc induces humoral IgG antibody response comparable to those induced by s.c. vaccination, including neutralizing antibodies, but more robust systemic cellular immune responses and higher local mucosal immune responses in mouse lungs 84 . In the rhesus macaque, a recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) protein vaccine can also induce sustained and robust immunological responses 85 . These studies suggest that RBD-based CoV vaccines have potential for preventing respiratory infections caused by CoV, further enhancing beneficial strategies for emerging coronavirus infection. However, it is worth noting that highly purified proteins are generally low immunogenicity and often require the addition of vaccine adjuvants. To summarize, an effective vaccine against coronavirus infection often needs to induce the body to produce strong humoral immune response and cellular immune response.

As a powerful agonist for Th1 cells, CFA can induce Th1 cytokines and enhance cellular and humoral immune responses. While IFA generally induce Th2 cytokines 91-93 . Mice immunized with SARS-CoV rRBD antigen together with Freund's adjuvant induce not just high titer of neutralizing antibodies, but relatively high levels of CTL and Th responses 94 . Freund's adjuvant induces a more balanced Th1 and Th2 immune response, providing more comprehensive protection against coronavirus infection. Freund's adjuvant is not approved for use in human vaccines due to its toxicity 95 . Despite this, Montanide ISA-51, also known as incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), has been approved for human use in 2012 96,97 . Similar as classic Freund's water emulsion, the addition of Montanide ISA-51 in RBD-based vaccines can produce strong antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies response against CoV infection 83,98 . The toxicity of Freund's adjuvant mainly comes from the non-degradable oil in the ingredients. To avoid the toxicity problem of Freund's adjuvant, oil-in-water emulsions prepared from biocompatible oils such as squalene (e.g., SAS and MF59) were developed 99-101 . The Sigma adjuvant system (SAS) is a stable oil-in-water emulsion containing monophosphoryl lipid A, which has been used in animal experiments. One study indicated that the SARS-CoV rRBD protein with SAS protect mouse against lethal SARS-CoV challenge, where the protection correlated well with the high titer of neutralizing antibodies 102 . In addition, MERS-CoV S1 protein together with SAS was identified to elicit robust serum neutralizing activity against several MERS-CoV strains in immunized mice 103 . MF59, another squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion, has been licensed in Europe for adjuvanted influenza vaccines. It is revealed that MERS-CoV RBD in trimeric form with MF59 elicits highly efficacious Th2-based IgG1 and Th1-based IgG2 antibody responses, as well as neutralizing antibodies against pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV, protecting 83% of hDPP4-Tg mice from lethal MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 4) 104 .

As one of the best characterized PRRs, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are widely distributed in antigen presenting cells and play an important role in triggering innate immunity and priming the adaptive immune response107 . Therefore, several TLR agonists have been investigating as virus-specific vaccine adjuvants to induce strong and sustained immune responses108,109 .The Toll-like receptor (TLR) families have been characterized as key players in RNA virus detection and antiviral immunity. Polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) is a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analogue that acts as a TLR3 receptor agonist, inducing the production of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines through a TRIF-dependent pathway110 . Previous reports have indicated mice deficient in the TLR3 signaling way are extremely susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased lung pathology and higher viral titers 111 . Additionally, intranasal treatment with PolyI:C induces both innate and T cell immune responses against viral infections, protecting aged animals from infection by IAV or SARS-CoV, as well as providing more rapid virus clearance 112 . Furthermore, MERS-CoV S protein together with poly I:C effectively trigger CD8 T-Cells response to accelerate MERS-CoV clearance without immunopathological effects 113 . These results suggest that PolyI:C, a potent type I IFN inducer, should be evaluated as a promising adjuvant in CoV subunit vaccines. TLR4 mainly recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. Unlike other TLRs, TLR4 agonists mediate the production of inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN via MyD88 as well as TRIF signaling pathway 114 . It has been demonstrated that pretreatment with TLR4 ligands provides protective immunity against infections by SARS-CoV 112 . Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)-a TLR4 agonist-is an attenuated version of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). MPLA has proven its safety and effectiveness in licensed vaccines, including human papillomavirus and hepatitis B vaccines 115,116 . Previous work has shown that inclusion of MPLA as an adjuvant in influenza vaccine promotes mucosal and systemic (Th1-skewed) immune responses after pulmonary vaccination 117 . In addition, SARS-CoV S protein with adjuvanated TLR3 and TLR4 agonists successfully induce high expression of antigen-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies without eosinophilic infiltrations and elicit Th1/17 cytokine responses in the lungs after the SARS-CoV challenge infection in the mouse model 118 . The above results indicated that TLR4 agonist, as a powerful Th1-type adjuvant, can effectively improve the immunogenicity of the CoV subunit vaccines and reduce the Th2-related eosinophilic pathological response. TLR9 recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs that are commonly found in bacterial and viral DNA, and then mediates the antiviral response of type I IFN via the TLR9-MyD88 pathway 119 . CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) sequence 1018, as an adjuvant for immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV), has been proven to significantly increase neutralizing antibody titers in clinical trials 120 . Recently it has been approved for adults in the United States 121 . A novel CpG ODN (BW001) has been shown to effectively activate B and NK cells and stimulate the body to secrete high level of IFN-a and IFN-\u03b3, thereby producing strong anti-SARS-CoV activity 122 . Furthermore, CpG have been identified to be superior to other TLR agonists (TLR3 agonists: PolyI:C; TLR7/8 agonists: R848) in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and activation of SARS-CoV S peptide specific CD8 + T cell response123 . Due to the strong ability of CpG to induce cellular immunity, it is often used in combination with alum to supplement the defects of alum in inducing cellular immunity. For instance, mice immunized with SARS-CoV S protein amino acids 318-510 (S318-510) together with alum and CpG ODN show higher humoral and cellular immune responses than those immunized with S318-510 antigen and alum alone(Fig. 5)30,124 .

The CoV S protein-based vaccines are further classified into different types, including viral vector, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), VLP and protein-based vaccines. Subunit vaccines have become the focus of current research due to their numerous advantages, but it often requires appropriate adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity. In the USA, aluminum, MF59, and CpG are adjuvants included in licensed vaccines. These three adjuvants have shown induction of serum neutralizing antibodies and protection against infection in mice challenged with an infectious virus, which might be used for CoV subunit vaccine administration 85,88,104,106,122,123 . However, alum alone cannot induce a potent Th1 response unless combined with another adjuvant, such as CpG. This adjuvant combination will improve the effectiveness of the CoV subunit vaccines 124 . Similarly, in order to effectively activate the complex and orderly natural immune system and produce the expected acquired immune response, it is sometimes necessary to use an adjuvant combination 30 . Here, we believe that adjuvant formulations that induce a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune response can more effectively improve the immunogenicity of the antigen 73,84,104 , becoming a new trend in the development of coronavirus adjuvants. Ideally, an effective CoV vaccine is required to induce both robust humoral and cell-mediated immunities. Even though many promising vaccine candidates have been reported, there are still no commercial vaccines available against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The comprehensive lessons and experiences brought by the outbreak of SARS and MERS provide valuable insights and progress on how to respond to COVID-19. With the spread of COVID-19, scientific institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the world are racing against time to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. According to WHO, there are at least 100 research projects on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the world 129 . In addition to traditional inactivated virus and live-attenuated virus vaccines, the developments of most SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are also based on some new technological routes, such as mRNA vaccines, subunit vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and DNA vaccines. Up to now, eight candidate vaccines have entered clinical trials, including three inactivated vaccines from Wuhan Institute of Biological Products 130 , Beijing Institute of Biological Products 131 and Sinovac 132 , two adenovirus vector vaccines (Ad5-nCoV from CanSino Biologicals 133 and COV001 from Inovio 134 ), two mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273 from Moderna 135 and BNT162 from BioNTech 136 ) and one DNA vaccine (INO-4800 from Inovio 137 ). Although some progress has been made in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, it is important to realize that vaccine development is a rigorous scientific exploration process. Due to many challenges of verifying the effectiveness of vaccines, it is still very likely that no SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will be available in the market for human in near future. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development still requires the unremitting efforts of researchers in the world.
