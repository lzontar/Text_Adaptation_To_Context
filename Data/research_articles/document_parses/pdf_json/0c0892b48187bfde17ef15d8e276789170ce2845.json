The median length (days) of the studies was 179 d (IQR: 94-366 d), which is highly unfavorable in the current critical situation. We believe that, in the current situation, the \"timeliness\" factor should be given importance in the design of clinical trials, so that the research does not lose its social significance. Therefore, in this critical situation, it is better to use \"sequential design\" for clinical trials; \"sequential design\" not only requires small sample sizes, but also significantly shortens the research period; therefore, it is very conducive to the screening and discovery of drugs with significant efficacy [36, 37] . In addition, a significant problem is the treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID-19. For these patients, we suggested that, based on the \"compassionate use drug\" principle, conducting staged small batch and single-arm clinical trials with safe and obvious potential antiviral drugs is feasible. We believe that \"compassionate use drug\" can not only meet the special needs of patients but also be used in clinical effectiveness observation, research, and analysis, both enhancing the efficiency of research and benefitting the patients [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Moreover, the large number of clinical cases that have accumulated information and using available existing data for statistical analysis with the help of new statistical methods, such as clinical data-mining [43] [44] [45] and real-world study [46] [47] [48] , can help in quickly obtaining very valuable information and save research time.",
