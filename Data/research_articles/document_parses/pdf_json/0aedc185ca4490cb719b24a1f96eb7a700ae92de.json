Alternative estimates include 60% (Meltzer et al., 2015) and 71.1% . c Percentage points increase in fatality when hospitals are overwhelmed. We assumed a 1% increase in the IFR to approximately double the population-weighted age-based IFR in Chile, based on data from COVID19 in China (Zhang Zuqin et al., 2020) minus 20% to account for improvements in case-detection in Chile since the outbreak's start). c Estimates differ by region due to age structure of the populations (Supplementary Material S2). d All beds available in the healthcare system, from public and private hospitals, are now part of the \"Sistema Integrado COVID-19\" under the centralized administration of the Ministry of Health. An intensive care bed (ICU) consists of a cot with a monitor, healthcare professionals and medication to treat patient. Some have a mechanical ventilator. There are an estimated 1,847 mechanical ventilators; 850 currently available and 997 were acquired in January 2020. (Latorre and Sandoval, 2020) We assumed the distribution of mechanical ventilators was proportional to the number of critical beds in each region: Metropolitana,47.0%; Araucan\u00eda, 4.3%; \u00d1uble, 1.2%. (Supplementary Material S2) e Based on the reported number hospitalized in \"basic beds\" (1, 216) and in \"critical care beds\" (699) in all of Chile by the Ministry of Health as of May 4, 2020 out of the total existing beds nationally in March 2020 plus anticipated beds being added to expand pandemic treatment capacity: 41,706 and 4,954, respectively. Latorre et al.(2020) f Availability of mechanical ventilators was based on a three-year study of 97 ICUs in the US. g Calculated by applying the % ICU patients needing ventilation (Table 2 ) to the number of COVID patients in critical care beds (see note e) and dividing the result by the total ventilators in Chile (see note f).
