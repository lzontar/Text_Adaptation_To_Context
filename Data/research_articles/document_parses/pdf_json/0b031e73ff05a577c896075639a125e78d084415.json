This paper contains a systematic review of peer-reviewed published articles within the past 25 years addressing IPV prevention and intervention programming designed for this vulnerable population. We examined specific group-format programs and curricula conducted at community-based agencies with social services across the country. Qualitative analysis of the 10 articles that met search criteria (i.e., programs must be culturally specific, designed to serve IL, conducted in group-format, focused on IPV intervention or prevention) generated information regarding the nature of group interventions addressing this issue and population. Several themes emerged upon completion of the qualitative review describing key characteristics of each intervention. All reviewed articles reported generally positive outcomes using a variety of methods. Studies using quantitative methods found statistically significant outcomes for constructs including depression, self-esteem, and knowledge of wellness.

IPV is defined as abuse that occurs in intimate relationships regardless of culture, race/ethnicity, or sexual orientation and involves behaviors used by one person to gain or maintain power and control over the other person. Characteristics and types of abuse in IPV include psychological, physical, sexual, verbal, economic abuse, or isolation (Marrs Fuchsel 2017). Population surveys conducted among women in the U.S. indicate that one out of four women will experience some type of IPV in their lifetime; Latina women experience severe forms of violence and negative health outcomes at significantly higher rates (Bhuyan and Velagapudi 2013; Gonzalez-Guarda et al. 2013) . Currently, immigrant Latinas (IL) comprise nearly a fifth (17%) of the total native and foreign-born Latino population living in the U.S. (U.S. Census Bureau 2016). Furthermore, researchers have determined immigrant women, including Latino, South Asian, and Korean women experience higher rates (30% to 50%) of IPV than the general population of women (22.1%) over their lifetime and are less likely to seek support (Ammar et al. 2012; Bhuyan and Velagapudi 2013) . Although studies have documented the severity of IPV and health consequences among Latinas, recent studies using community samples are examining prevalence rates, severity, and barriers to accessing services impacting one group of vulnerable womenimmigrant Latinas (Bhuyan and Velagapudi 2013; Reina and Lohman, 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 770, "end": 798, "text": "(Bhuyan and Velagapudi 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 799, "end": 827, "text": "Gonzalez-Guarda et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1265, "text": "(Ammar et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1293, "text": "Bhuyan and Velagapudi 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1589, "text": "(Bhuyan and Velagapudi 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1613, "text": "Reina and Lohman, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Intimate Partner Violence Prevention and Intervention Group-Format Programs for Immigrant Latinas: A Systematic Review"}, {"text": "Due to the increase of IL living in communities who are exposed to IPV and encounter unique stressors and barriers in help-seeking behaviors, organizations offering social services for IL and their families need specific intervention programs to address this phenomenon.

By doing so, researchers might detect a broader scope of intervention programs with successful group-format interventions addressing IPV and Latinas in general. Future research could employ a smaller timeframe to capture more recent and current interventions and utilize grey literature to include those programs not represented in the academic literature. Another study might include conducting a national survey of program directors of identified community-based agencies who are conducting group-format intervention and prevention programs among this population. Findings have implications for mental health professionals and professionals who work with IL experiencing incidences of IPV. Although communitybased agencies and shelters are available that may provide IPV group-format interventions, often IL cannot access these services. Therefore, by using group-format interventions in community-based agencies, IL may be more exposed to these types of programs and services and may feel empowered to change their lives.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Future Research Directions"}, {"text": "In addition, findings have implications for group facilitators (e.g., professionals who conduct groups in diverse practice settings) who require culturally relevant and effective group-format interventions that work. Group facilitators can use group interventions in addition to individual interventions to strengthen their direct practice setting. Finally, educators from various professionals and disciplines (e.g., social work, psychology, marriage and family therapy, counseling) and who teach about direct practice interventions (i.e., group or individual interventions) can use the findings of this study to teach students about group-format intervention and prevention programs for use among IL who are affected by IPV. Education around group work with IL experiencing IPV should include information reflected in the findings presented in this paper to promote research-informed practice. This includes teaching students about the importance of social support in group work with IL, collaborating with communitybased agencies, addressing culturally relevant topics for IL as distinct from Latina populations (e.g., legal complexities of immigration and IPV), and using curricula and theoretical frameworks to guide group interventions. Students can gain knowledge on best-practices regarding the type of group, focus, and methods for meeting the distinct needs of IL.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Future Research
