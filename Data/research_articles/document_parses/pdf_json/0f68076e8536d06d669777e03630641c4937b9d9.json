Canadian authorities became aware of these events on April 17; however, it was soon realized that Canadian cases had already occurred. The ability of this influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 strain to effectively spread globally led the World Health Organization (WHO) on June 11, 2009 to declare that the criteria for phase 6 of an influenza pandemic had been met. 1 As of August 28, 2009, the Global Public Health Intelligence Network 2 had identified, through global media surveillance reports, 282,339 confirmed cases in 195 countries, including 2,950 deaths. This article will summarize the initial Canadian experience with the pandemic and discuss plans of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to address it in the coming months.",

The initial Canadian pandemic planning efforts began in the early 1980s, approximately 15 years after the last pandemic in 1968, when influenza A H3N2 first emerged as a human pathogen. By the time of SARS in 2004, two pandemic plans had already been developed, and a 10-year contract had been put in place in 2001 to ensure a Canadian supply of influenza vaccine at the time of a pandemic. However, post SARS, Canadian and WHO efforts markedly increased to prepare for a new pandemic; these efforts were further encouraged by the persistent circulation of avian H5N1 influenza, which repeatedly demonstrated its ability to infect humans through direct contact with infected birds. As a result of these efforts, federal, provincial and territorial governments produced a Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Sector in 2004, and a revised version was published in 2006, although new and revised annexes have been included up until the present time. 3 The National Antiviral Stockpile was also created that currently includes 48.7 million adult doses of oseltamivir, 2 million paedi-atric doses of oseltamivir and 5 million doses of zanamivir; quantities considered sufficient to treat 17.5% of the Canadian population during a pandemic of moderate severity and with an anticipated 35% clinical attack rate. Additional doses of antiviral drugs in the Federal National Emergency Stockpile System and held by some jurisdictions mean that the actual quantity of drugs available is sufficient to treat almost 25% of the population.",

Existing preparatory activities and agreements through the North American Plan for Avian and Pandemic Influenza, 4 the Global Health Security Initiative 5 and by WHO provided mechanisms for governments within and outside of North America to rapidly exchange information and provide assistance. Both PHAC and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided laboratory and epidemiological support for our counterparts in Mexico; the National Microbiology Laboratory, PHAC, received regular shipments of specimens from Mexico until sufficient laboratory capacity was established there by the international teams.",

Virus transmission, however, quickly became widespread in affected communities and the extensive testing being done soon overburdened existing laboratory testing capacity in some jurisdictions, resulting in delays in case reporting. Canadian surveillance has now moved away from daily case-based reporting to weekly reporting of influenza-related activity published in FluWatch. 6 The initial active surveillance for ILI, although resource intensive, documented the introduction of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 into a number of communities across Canada by Canadians returning from spring travel to Mexico. An analysis of 567 pandemic influenza (H1N1) cases with travel-related information reported to PHAC by May 22, 2009 revealed that 52% of cases with onset between April 12 and May 3 had traveled within 7 days prior to onset of their illness; however, only 4% of cases with onset between May 4-16 had such a history. Of those who had traveled, 87% had traveled to Mexico. While the emergence of a pandemic strain in North America was always a possibility, the most frequent planning assumption was for it to appear in Asia, allowing Canadians days to weeks to fully implement a response. Our preparedness activities, however, did allow us to quickly put in place a multijurisdictional coordination process, allowing for common approaches to be developed based on the best available information.",

While the Canadian surveillance case definition has proved useful for monitoring the presence of influenza-related illness in communities, more sensitive case definitions should be used for triaging patients in clinical settings during known periods of influenza virus circulation in a given community; the use of fever or cough during these periods might be considered sufficient to provide early treatment to individuals at high risk for complications from influenza or for screening patients on admission to settings with high-risk patients.",
