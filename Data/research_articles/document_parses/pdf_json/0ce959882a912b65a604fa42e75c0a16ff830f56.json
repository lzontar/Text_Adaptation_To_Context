            "text": "A 21 PRF signal in the CCR5 receptor mRNA CCR5 is a cytokine receptor which is exploited by HIV-1 as a coreceptor for entry into CD4 1 T-cells 8 . A strong candidate 21 PRF signal beginning at nucleotide 407 in the human CCR5 mRNA was identified computationally 9 . This sequence is .99% conserved among the great apes and is highly conserved among the higher primates (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). Using dual luciferase reporters (Extended Data Fig. 2a) , the CCR5 sequence promoted 9-11% 21 PRF in HeLa (Fig. 1a ) and 4.5-6.3% in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or Vero cells (Extended Data Fig. 2b) . Mutagenesis of the slippery site from UUUAAAA to GCGCGCG reduced 21 PRF to ,1% (Fig. 1a) . Introduction of an inframe termination codon (PTC control) 59 of the CCR5-derived sequence, or placing the firefly luciferase reporter out of frame with respect to Renilla reduced 21 PRF levels by more than two orders of magnitude (Fig. 1a) , ruling out the possible presence of either a splicing donor site or an internal ribosome entry signal (IRES). An in vitro translation assay revealed a peptide consistent with a CCR5 21 PRF event at levels comparable to that promoted by the HIV-1 21 PRF signal (Fig. 1b) . Liquid chromatography dual mass spectroscopic analysis of an affinity purified CCR5-b-gal fusion protein (Extended Data Fig. 2c ) unambiguously identified the predicted 21 frameshift peptide harbouring the junction between the 02 and 21 frame encoded CCR5 sequence (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2d ). Analysis of published ribosome profiling data from human cells 10 revealed a sizable fraction of ribosomes paused at the CCR5 21 PRF signal, 9/59 (,15%) of which were shifted into the 21 reading frame (Fig. 1d) . These four lines of inquiry demonstrate that this sequence in the human CCR5 mRNA promotes efficient 21 PRF.",

Analyses of chemical modification assays of a CCR5 runoff transcript (Extended Data Fig. 3b , c) were consistent with the presence of a two-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot (Fig. 2) . Whereas the slippery site distal region of Stem 1 is stable, the proximal region is conformationally dynamic, consistent with single-molecule optical trap experiments revealing a complex network of folding pathways for this element 11 . The weak slippery site proximal half of stem 1 coupled with the internal bulge is reminiscent of the HIV-1 21 PRF signal solution structure 12 and is consistent with the emerging view of conformational complexity as a critical feature of recoding pseudoknots 13, 14 . Stem 2 contains four semi-helical segments (labelled a, b, d, e in Fig. 2a) , plus a small segment in the middle (c), all separated by unpaired bases. The unpaired bases may allow the entire structure to bend, enabling U23 to bridge the gap between C22 and U24. The 'best fit' conformer diagrammed in Fig. 2a was used as the basis for molecular-dynamics-based simulation of the CCR5 21 PRF stimulatory mRNA structure (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3d, e) . The root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) average structure was calculated for the last 12 ns of an 80-ns long molecular dynamics simulation, where the r.m.s.d.s of the full structure and its two sub-domains SL1 (nucleotides 8-22 and 55-75) and SL2 (nucleotides 24-53 and 76-103) are most stable.

            "text": "As cellular gene expression tends to be regulated, it is reasonable to hypothesize that 21 PRF might be regulated in a sequence-specific manner. This could be achieved through base-pairing interactions between specific small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and 21 PRF signals, a hypothesis supported by the ability of antisense oligonucleotides to stimulate 21 PRF (reviewed in ref. 1) . Computational searches revealed miR-1224, miR-711 and miR-141 as potential interacting partners with the CCR5 21 PRF signal (Extended Data Fig. 4a ). Transfection of HeLa cells with a miR-1224 precursor revealed concentration-dependent enhancement of CCR5-mediated 21 PRF (Fig. 3a) . miR-1224 did not affect HIV-1-mediated 21 PRF. Addition of a miR-1224 antagomir (anti-miR-1224), or short interfering RNA knockdown of argonaute 1 reversed the effect of miR-1224 on CCR5-mediated 21 PRF (Fig. 3b) . Although anti-miR-1224 seemed to stimulate CCR5 21 PRF, the effect was not significant (P 5 0.15). siRNA knockdown of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in miRNA processing inhibited CCR5-mediated 21 PRF, but stimulated HIV-1-driven 21 PRF (Fig. 3c ), supporting the model of sequence-specific regulation of 21 PRF through interactions between miRNAs and 21 PRF signals. Neither miR-141 nor miR-711 affected 21 PRF in a HeLa-cells-based assay (Extended Data Fig. 4b) , perhaps owing to the presence of endogenous miR-711, and/or miR-141. However, miR-141 specifically stimulated CCR5-mediated 21 PRF in CHO cells (Extended Data Fig. 4c ).",

The 59 proximal mutant (M1) yielded the same K D (0.76 nM) as the wild-type sequence under 'refolded' conditions, the central sequence mutant (M2) promoted the same dissociation constant as the wild-type sequence assayed under 'native' conditions (0.36 nM), and the 39 proximal binding site mutant (M3) caused an approximately 100-fold increase in K D (42 nM) (Fig. 4d , Extended Data Fig. 6b, c) . These findings suggest that miR-1224 may participate in a triple helical interaction with subdomains a-d of Stem 2 under native conditions (modelled in Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6c ). The predicted triple-base interaction between miR-1224 and Stem 2 is consistent with the stable 39 end of the pseudoknot identified in the molecular dynamics simulation (Extended Data Fig. 3d , e). The 'torsional restraint' model of 21 PRF posits that ribosomes are directed to pause over the slippery site by Stem 2-induced supercoiling of Stem 1 16 . The miR-1224 mapping data are consistent with this model: increased stability of the Stem 2 by the mRNA-miRNA interaction renders this structure even more difficult to resolve, further increasing the fraction of paused ribosomes. miR-141 is predicted to interact with the same region of the CCR5 21 PRF signal whereas miR-711 is not, suggesting that miR-141 enhances CCR5-directed 21 PRF in a similar manner to miR-1224. The sequence of the mature miR-1224 is 100% conserved among higher primates (Homo, Pan, Pongo and Macaca) as is its binding site with the 39 end of their respective CCR5 21 PRF signals, suggesting that miR-1224-mediated regulation of CCR5 21 PRF is evolutionarily conserved.

A series of rabbit b-globin-derived reporters (Extended Data Fig. 7a ) were used to assess the effects of the CCR5 21 PRF signal on mRNA steady-state abundance and stability. Steady-state abundance of the CCR5 21 PRF-containing reporter mRNA was about 38% of the readthrough control and was further decreased upon addition of miR-1224 (,10% of readthrough control), consistent with an inverse correlation between 21 PRF efficiency and mRNA abundance 2 (Fig. 5a ). An in-frame PTC strongly decreased mRNA abundance (,1% of readthrough control). A reporter with the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-aderived AU-rich element (ARE) in its 39 untranslated region (UTR) 17 reduced mRNA abundance to ,22%. In combination with the CCR5 21 PRF signal, mRNA abundance was reduced to ,6%, consistent with NMD and ARE-mediated decay operating independently of one another. The CCR5 slippery site mutant (SSM) decreased reporter mRNA abundance to ,64%, and addition of miR-1224 decreased this to ,47%. The former finding suggests that the stable mRNA pseudoknot has mRNA destabilizing activity independent of frameshifting, perhaps through the no-go mRNA pathway as described in yeast 18 . Its stabilization by miR-1224 may enhance this process. Alternatively, miR-1224 may promote accelerated mRNA turnover through canonical miRNA-mediated translational repression 19 . However, if this were true, miR-1224 should have reduced SSM mRNA abundance to the same extent as the native sequence. Abundance of the CCR5 21 PRF signal containing reporter mRNA was increased by about 4.4-fold by partial siRNA knockdown of NMD (Fig. 5b) . Abundance of the SSM construct was not increased by NMD ablation, consistent with its mRNA Biotinylated miR-1224 precursor or a scrambled biotinylated control (Scr) were transfected into HeLa TZM BL cells expressing CCR5.

Conversely, addition of miR-1224 decreased both CCR5 mRNA and CCR5 protein abundance. Abrogation of miRNA processing by siRNA knockdown of AGO1 or DGCR8 resulted in increased abundance mRNA and protein, consistent with inhibition of CCR5-mediated 21 PRF under these conditions. Transcriptional arrest time-course experiments demonstrated that the CCR5 mRNA is a direct substrate for NMD (Extended Data Fig. 7c ). Whereas miR-1224 decreased the abundance of CCR5 mRNA, this effect was abrogated by addition of an anti-miR-1224 antagomir, but antagomir alone had no effect (Extended Data Fig. 7d ). siRNA knockdown of SMG1 was epistatic to miR-1224, consistent with the mRNA destabilization activity of the miRNA being NMD-dependent. This is also consistent with findings that human UPF1 may participate in RNA silencing 20 , with the caveat that miR-1224 may also promote mRNA degradation by a mechanism that is independent of the NMD machinery, for example, No-go decay. Combinations involving human SMG1 siRNA knockdown plus miR-1224, human SMG1 siRNA knockdown plus the antagomir, or all three together were also supportive of this model.",

            "text": "To summarize, precise regulation of 21 PRF is accomplished by sequence-specific interactions between individual 21 PRF signals and naturally occurring miRNAs. That global ablation of miRNA processing differentially affected 21 PRF promoted by many different signals suggests that miRNA-mediated control of 21 PRF is the biologically significant norm. This confers sequence specificity, and is energetically less expensive than producing new, or modifying pre-existing ribosomes. It may also enable rapid regulation of 21 PRF on specific mRNAs within individual cells or intracellular compartments. This solves the central question, unanswered until now, of how 21 PRF may be regulated in a sequence-specific manner, and suggests a novel mode through which 21 PRF signals may be targeted for therapeutic intervention. To our knowledge, this is also one of the few demonstrations of an miRNA affecting the expression of a cellular gene through an interaction with its ORF. The discovery of 21 PRF signals in the mRNAs encoding cytokine receptors has a potentially profound impact on our understanding of immune homeostasis. Although a robust immune response is critical for limiting and preventing infection, left uncontrolled, it can rapidly result in pathology and death. Despite a large body of literature describing how expression of small-peptide mediators of the immune response are regulated at the level of mRNA stability, this only provides a global mechanism of immune regulation by controlling production of effector molecules. In contrast, the ability to control expression of cytokine receptors through 21 PRF induced NMD, and how rates of 21 PRF in turn may be controlled by miRNAs, represents a way for individual recipient cells to modulate their responses to cytokines; this would provide the means to fine-tune immune responses, and suggests a novel molecular mechanism underlying immune desensitization. The studies described here also have consequences for directing antiviral efforts. RNA viruses such as retroviruses, coronaviruses, alphaviruses and totiviruses require extremely stringent levels of 21 PRF for their propagation 1 .

If the latter is true, as suggested by stimulation of HIV-1-promoted 21 PRF in response to siRNA knockdown of argonaute, this may define a new parameter governing host cell permissiveness, presenting a novel therapeutic targeting opportunity. Thus, while the discovery of operational 21 PRF signals in cellular mRNAs suggests that global targeting of 21 PRF may not be the wisest approach, discovery and subsequent targeting of specific cellular miRNAs required by viruses to ensure proper rates of 21 PRF may present a more narrowly targeted therapeutic option.",

            "text": "Sequencing grade Asp-N was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Triethylammonium bicarbonate, and iodoacetamide were purchased from Supelco. DTT was from Sigma. Formic acid, optima grade water and acetonitrile are from Fisher Scientific. In-Gel digestion was carried out following manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, gel was cut into pieces ,1 mm 3 , destained with 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in water, dehydrated with ACN, then rehydrated with 25 mM DTT, incubated at 65 uC for 20 min, washed, dehydrated with ACN. Samples were rehydrated with 50 mM iodoacetamide, incubated at room temperature in the dark for 25 minutes, washed with water, and dehydrated with ACN. Gel was then rehydrated with 10 ng ml 21 Asp-N solution, and incubated overnight at 37 uC. Peptides were extracted twice by sequential addition of 100 ml 50% ACN, 100 ml 20% formic acid, and 100 ml. Extracts were combined and concentrated with speedvac to dryness. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Peptides were redissolved in 50 ml solvent A and loaded into a trapping cartridge (0.3 3 5 mm, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) with autosampler, and desalted with 100% solvent A at 10 ml min 21 for 10 min. Peptides were separated using a Zorbax 300 B-C18 nano column (3.5 mm, 0.075 3 150 mm, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) with a binary gradient consisting of A: 0.1% formic acid with 2.5% acetonitrile and B: 0.1% formic acid and 97.5% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 200 nl min 21 . A gradient was run from 5% B to 25%B over 60 min, followed by a 50-min gradient to 50% B, and 10-min gradient to 80%B. The gradient was held at 80% B for 5 min before returning to 5% B. Positive ion mass spectra of Nano LC eluents were acquired with a Thermo Finnigan LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer with data dependent analysis in which a full Scan FT analysis of m/z 400-1,800 with resolution at 60,000 (m/z 400) in the Orbitrap is followed by up to 5 MS/MS analyses in the linear ion trap at unit mass resolution. Peptides eluting from the HPLC column that have ions above 10,000 arbitrary intensity units and charges higher than 1 trigger the ion trap to isolate the ion and perform an MS/MS experiment scan after the MS full scan. Dynamic exclusion was set at 1 repeat count and 60 s exclusion time. Data processing. A common contaminants protein database was downloaded from http://maxquant.org. Sequence of CCR5-LacZ was inserted into the database before the database was imported into the in-house Mascot Server and Proteome Discoverer 1.4 program. Raw data from LTQ Orbitrap was searched against the modified common contaminant database using Sequest HT and Mascot with AspN as digestion enzyme with up to 1 missed cleavage. Peptide mass tolerance was 6 20 p.p.m., and fragment mass tolerance was 6 0.8 Da. Carbamidomethyl (C), Deamidated (NQ), Oxidation (M), Acetyl (N-term) are set as variable modifications. Decoy search was performed and false discovery rate of ,1% required for positive Identification. Search results showed 36% sequence coverage of the CCR5-LacZ protein. The N-terminal peptide was unambiguously identified, with loss of the initial methionine and acetylation of the N-terminal threonine. Quantification of protein levels by ELISA. HeLa TZM-BL were transiently transfected with siRNAs against SMG1, AGO1, DGCR8, miRNA precursor of hsa-miR-1224-5p, scrambled sequence or mock transfected using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). The cells were lysed using 0.5% Fos-choline-12 (Affymetrix) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 lysis buffer. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Concentrations of CCR5 protein were measured in 16 mg total protein of cell lysates using the CCR5 sandwich ELISA kit (US Biological Life Sciences), according to the manufacturer's protocol. All assays were repeated in triplicate. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR. For qPCR analyses of the b-globin based reporters, assays were performed as previously described 26 with the following modifications. The dual luciferase readthrough control was used for RESEARCH ARTICLE co-transfections rather than EGFP. RNA samples for qPCR were isolated using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion), digested with rDNase (Ambion) and analysed using agarose gel electrophoresis and/or OD 260/280 measurements. The remaining samples were reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA kit (Bio-Rad). The resulting complementary DNAs were diluted to 1:50-10,000 depending on mRNA concentration. Reactions were performed using 10 ml of LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master mix (Roche), 0.2-0.3 mM of each oligonucleotide, 2 ml of cDNA, and water to 20 ml per well. Samples were assayed for genomic DNA contamination by performing the assay using wells containing 1-2 ml of digested mRNA instead of cDNA. Reactions were amplified using either a Roche 480 LightCycler or a Bio-Rad CFX 96 thermocycler as follows: 25 uC for 10 s, 95 uC for 5 min, followed by 45-60 cycles of 95 uC for 10 s, 52 uC for 15 s, and 72 uC for 15 s. Melting curves were monitored by taking readings every 0.5 uC from 52-95 uC. The time-course qPCR analyses were performed with 53 uC and 54 uC annealing temperatures and 20 s extension time with no significant changes in results. For qPCR analyses of the full length CCR5 mRNA, assays were performed as described for the b-globin assays, but using oligonucleotides specific for b-micoglobulin and/or GAPDH and CCR5 27 . Reactions were amplified using the same conditions as for the b-globin constructs except all reactions used 20 s at 55 uC for extension. All assays were performed at least three times. Time course assays. mRNA decay time course assays using the tetracycline repressible rabbit b-globin reporter were performed as previously described with minor changes 26 . To monitor time-dependent decay of the CCR5 mRNA, HeLa Tzm1 cells were first transfected with either scrambled or hSMG1 siRNAs as described above. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with actinomycin D (10 mM). In all experiments, RNA isolations were performed immediately at each time point after transcriptional arrest using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion) rather than after freezing samples on dry ice. RNAi assays. Cells were transfected with RNA oligonucleotides specific to UPF1, UPF2, SMG1, argonaute 1, argonaute 2, DGCR8, exportin 5, or random oligonucleotides using the HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Initial transfections were performed at 1, 5, 10 nM and 20 nM for optimization. Final transfections were performed at 5 nM. The MAPK cell-death positive control was used for optimization as well as qPCR quantification of the targeted mRNA. Most final transfections were performed at 5 nM. Transfections were performed into 30,000-40,000 cells (via haemocytometer) in 500 ml of DMEM1FBS using 100 ml of DMEM without FBS and 3 ml of HiPerFect reagent after incubating for 15-20 min at room temperature. Media was replaced with fresh DMEM1 FBS after 8-12 h. Assays were performed 36-72 h after siRNA transfection. When other plasmids were also transfected, they were performed separately 24-48 h after siRNA transfection using the FuGENE 6 (Roche) reagent. miRNA transfection. Cells were transfected with the following miRNA precursors: hsa-miR-141, hsa-miR-711, hsa-miR-1224-5p, and hsa-miR-1205 using either siPORT, lipofectamine, or HiPerfect reagent (Applied Biosystems/Ambion). When performing miRNA transfections with all miRNAs, 10-30 nM was used, depending on cell viability. When performing the miRNA titration, four 1:10 dilutions were used starting at 5 nM. Transfections were performed into 20,000-40,000 cells in 500 ml DMEM1FBS using 25 ml of DMEM without FBS and 1 ml of siPORT reagent after incubating for 20 min at room temperature per well. Media was replaced with fresh DMEM1FBS after 8-12 h. Dual luciferase plasmid transfections were either performed at the same time or 24 h later using the FuGENE 6 reagent. When HiPerfect was used, the conditions followed those used for siRNA transfections. Affinity purification of miRNA targets. Double stranded miR-1224-5p RNA containing a sense strand 59 biotin modification and mismatch were purchased from IDT. Pull-down experiments were performed as previously described 28 with the following modifications: Streptavidin agarose beads were pre-washed as described in 500 ml aliquots and stored for up to a week at 220 uC. Five washes with lysis buffer were performed rather than 3; after the final wash, 450 ml buffer was removed, samples were incubated for 5 min at 80u and quenched on ice for 2 min before isolating RNA. RNA isolations were performed using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion). qRT-PCR was used to observe mRNA isolation as previously described, using oligonucleotide primers specific for CCR5, Renilla luciferase, firefly luciferase and GAPDH for normalization. miR-1224 electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Transcripts harbouring the CCR5 21 PRF signal (247 nucleotides), mutants thereof, or HIV-1 21 PRF signal (315 nucleotides) were synthesized from DNA templates using T3 RNA polymerase using MEGAscript, and purified using MEGAClear kits (Ambion). HPLC purified miR-1224-5p (59GUGAGGACUCGGGAGGUGG39) RNA oligonucleotide was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, and was 59-[ 32 P]labelled by using the KinaseMax kit (Ambion). Small amounts of the CCR5 and HIV-1 derived mRNAs were also 59-[ 32 P]-labelled and used as markers. CCR5 or HIV RNA dilutions at 23 final concentration were mixed with equal volumes of 1.0 nM 59-[ 32 P]-labelled 1224-5p RNA. Samples were incubated at 37 uC for 30 min in HB buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCI, 10 mM MgCI 2 , 3% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue) and immediately separated through 10% native polyacrylamide gels. For experiments with RNA refolding the RNA mix was incubated at 90 uC for 5 s, cooled quickly to 60 uC and then slowly to 37 uC (0.02 uC per s). The electrophoresis buffer was 34 mM Tris-66 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl 2 . To confirm that multiple bands of CCR5 in native gel were RNA conformers, labelled CCR5, miR-1224-5p RNA, and the mix of these RNAs were separated through an 8% denaturing gel and visualized using a phosphoimager. Single site binding isotherms were generated using GraphPad Prizm. Chemical modification assays. Dimethylsulphate, kethoxal and CMCT were used to probe the solvent accessibility of individual bases 29, 30 , while NMIA was used to probe ribose 29-OH groups 31 in [ 32 P]-labelled run-off transcripts. In a separate experiment, synthetic CCR5 (139 nM) and miR-1224 (1.1 mM) RNAs were annealed at 37 uc for 30 min in 33 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 33 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 . Structure probing with NMIA and reverse transcription reactions were subsequently performed as described 31 . Products were separated through 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and visualized using a phosphorimager. Molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulation protocol. Three dimensional modelling based on the secondary structure shown in Fig. 2 was performed using programs RNAComposer 32,33 and RNA2D3D 34 . The preliminary 10 alternative structures were obtained from the RNAComposer web server (http://euterpe.man.poznan.pl/Home). However, most of the models produced were knotted in 3D and the best two alternatives had the backbones of loop L (see Fig. 2 ) pass through a helix in S1. RNA2D3D was used to separate the tangled structures. The corrected models (a total of six alternatives) were minimized, equilibrated in solvent with some restraints meant to maintain the base pairs strained in the preliminary models, and subjected to short (25 ns) molecular dynamics runs without any restraints, after which the best model (average structure with the lowest minimized energy) was subjected to extended molecular dynamics simulation lasting a total of 80 ns. Given how structurally tight the initial models were and the extent of manual editing required, the extended simulation was necessary to stabilize the model and obtain an accurate average structure.",

            "text": "Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with Amber 12 with the ff10 Cornell force field for RNA. The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) summation method was used to calculate the electrostatic interactions [35] [36] [37] . Following minimization, the RNA models (103 nucleotides long) were solvated in TIP3P waters with 102 neutralizing Na 1 ions and additional Na 1 /Clion pairs added to the solvent box to achieve a relative salt concentration of 0.1 M (from 51 to 57 depending on the system). The multi-step equilibration protocol started with solvent equilibration (minimization, heating and short dynamics stages) with the RNA being subject to slowly released motion restraints (holding). A periodic boundary condition was used in the simulation. The entire system was equilibrated at 300K using the Berendsen thermostat 38 , a cut-off of 9 \u00c5 was used with the non-bonded interactions and SHAKE was applied to all hydrogen bonds in the system. Pressure was maintained at 1.0 Pa using the Berendsen algorithm 39 . The last phase of the equilibration was performed for 2.0 ns with distance restraints placed on the hydrogen bonds of six base-pairs that were affected by the manual editing of the preliminary RNA models (base pairs: G8-U75, G12-U73, G13-C72, A14-U63, G16-U61, G17-C60). Following equilibration, the production simulation was performed with 2 fs time steps to obtain short trajectories of 25 ns. The total sizes of the systems subjected to molecular dynamics ranged from 71,462 to 79,346 atoms, including the 3,290 RNA atoms of the CCR5 model. The solvent boxes had a clearance distance of 10 \u00c5 (also named 'buffer' in Amber, that is, the minimum distance between the solute and the solvent box wall). Analyses of the molecular dynamics results excluded the equilibrations and were performed using the ptraj module of Amber. Multiple sequence alignment of CCR5 coding sequences. Sequences for CCR5 coding sequences were chosen for 39 primates and a naive BLAST search extended these candidates to 45 sequences with the CCR5 mRNA from Danio rerio chosen as an outgroup. Sequences were aligned with Clustal W 40 using default parameters (gap opening penalty: 15, extension penalty: 6, IUB matrix). The resulting alignment was manually edited using seaview 41 to trim especially long 39 UTR and long 59 UTR sequences (notably Danio rerio, sheep, goat, rat, and mouse). A guide tree was constructed using the default parameters of BioNJ 42 which was used as a starting tree for PhyML 43 . The GTR model was used with a nearest neighbour and SPR search strategy, 100 bootstrap replicates were performed. Branch lengths and bootstrap support are supplied above branches where appropriate. Analysis of ribosome profiling data. Sequence reads from Guo et al. 10 and Hsieh et al. 44 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus 45 . The ribosomal footprinting data was extracted and aligned against a library of human coding sequences from the Mammalian Gene Collection 46 using Bowtie2 47 .

data. Stems 1, 2, and the loop are indicated as S1, S2 and L. The five different segments of stem 2 are labelled a-e. Nucleotide bases showing low levels of reactivity with DMS, CMCT, and kethoxal, and ribose sugars whose 29-OH groups with NMIA were similarly non-reactive are noted as open circles. Moderately reactive sugars and bases are denoted by grey filled circles. Strongly modified (strongly reactive) sugars and bases are represented as black filled circles. Circles proximal to the bases denote reactivity of the bases, while circles distal to the bases denote reactivity of the ribose sugars. From left to right: mRNA pseudoknot best fit to data; mRNA pseudoknot predicted by Pknots; mRNA pseudoknot predicted by NUPAK; tandem stem-loops predicted by mFold. Red bases represent chemical modification patterns inconsistent with computational predictions. b, c, Chemical modification experiments. Autoradiograms of reverse transcriptase primer extensions performed on RNA transcribed by T7 RNA Pol from template PCR amplified from CCR5 21 PRF signal containing plasmid. Bands correspond to strong readthrough control (RT) stops 1 nucleotide 59 of bases modified by chemical reagents. b, The CCR5 mRNA was either left unmodified (un), or modified with 3 increasing concentrations of dimethyl sulphate (DMS, reacts with A and C), 1-cyclohexyl-(2morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT, reacts with U), or 1,1-dihydroxy-3-ethoxy-2-butanone (kethoxal, reacts with G) respectively. c, Primer extension reactions were performed on unmodified samples and samples incubated with 30, 65, and 110 nM NMIA (N-methyl isatoic anhydride). These are labelled 1, 2 and 3, respectively, beneath each sample, and 'un' denotes untreated RNA. d, The all atom r.m.s.d. plot of the 80 ns-long molecular dynamics simulation states against the reference structure (the starting state of the simulation) at the end of a 2 ns-long equilibration.

Transformations of E. coli were performed as described previously using the calcium chloride method. HeLa (ATCC), HeLa Tet-Off (Clonetech), HeLa TZM-BL (http://aidsresearch.org/, and provided by J. DeStefano), CHO and Vero cells were cultured at 37 uC in 5% (v/v) CO 2 using DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 13 non-essential amino acids, (Atlanta Biologicals), and 4 mM glutamine. 1% penicillin/streptomycin was used when cultivating TZM-BL cells before splitting for RNA interference. HeLa Tet-Off cells were cultured with 200 mg ml 21 G418. Plasmid construction. Synthetic oligonucleotides and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Materials. The PRF signal from Homo sapiens CCR5 was amplified from pCMV-XL4 (pJD819) containing the CCR5 open reading frame (Origene) using oligonucleotides with BamHI and SalI restriction sites. PCR products were ligated into p2luci (pJD175e)10 and clones were confirmed by sequencing (Genewiz). The QuikChange Lightning SDM kit (Agilent) was used to insert a stop codon immediately after the Renilla open reading frame and to make mutations to the CCR5 21 PRF signal. pTRE-Rb (pJD976), pTRE-Rb-ARE (pJD975), and pTET-Off (pJD979) were gifts from G. Brewer. Oligonucleotides (IDT) were chosen to include 23 nucleotides of the b-globin exon 1, 36 nucleotides of Renilla luciferase on the 59 side; and 23 nucleotides of b-globin exon 1, 15 nucleotides of firefly luciferase on the 39 side. Three hundred and thirty three nucleotides of b-globin containing sequence was PCR-amplified from the CCR5 dual luciferase plasmid, purified, and used as site-directed mutagenesis primer for the QuikChange Lightning BamHI-and SalI-containing product, and ligated into p2luci. Primers bGal-CCR5-Forward and bGal-CCR5Rev-Mut containing the CCR5 21 PRF signal were synthesized by IDT. The CCR5 frameshift signal sequence was amplified by PCR from pJD827 using these primers and Pfu Ultra II Hotstart 2X Mastermix (Agilent). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and KpnI and purified with GeneJet PCR purification Kit (ThermoFisher Fermentas).",

For the IL2RG, IL7RA and IL27RA sequences, minimum free energy (MFE) landscapes below the Feynman diagrams depict black vertical lines to delineate the positions of slippery heptamers; the horizontal green line shows the mean Vienna RNAfold value over the ORF; the horizontal red line shows the mean pknots value over the ORF; the horizontal blue line shows the mean nupack value. Green, red and blue lines delineate the MFE over a sliding 105-bp window. Arrows indicate where 21 PRF signals align with paused ribosomes in profiling data.",
