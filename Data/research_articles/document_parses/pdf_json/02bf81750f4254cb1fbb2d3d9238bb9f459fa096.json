Pneumonia occurs in 50% of patients with acute tetraplegia during acute hospitalization and rehabilitation [1] . Respiratory disorders account for 28% of deaths in the first year after injury and 22% of deaths in later years [2] . In patients who survive for at least 24 hours after injury, pneumonia or influenza causes 16.5% of all deaths [3] . This contrasts with that of the general population of the United States, for which pneumonia and influenza account for only 2.5% of deaths and the two diseases in combination are the eighth leading cause of death [4] . The standardized mortality ratio, a measure that adjusts for age, sex, and race, indicates that the rate of fatal pneumonia is elevated by a factor of 37 for people with SCI; persons with complete tetraplegia die from pneumonia at a rate that is 150 times higher than a matched population without SCI [2] .",

More recently, data on outpatient respiratory infections in Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with SCI have been reported.

The most obvious of these dysfunctions caused by SCI is weakness of the respiratory muscles. If the neurologic level is at C5 or rostral, there may be some degree of diaphragm weakness or even complete paralysis with higher level motorcomplete injuries. At lower neurologic levels, diaphragm innervation is intact, and this normally is sufficient to maintain at least 60% of the predicted vital capacity. Ventilatory failure caused by inspiratory muscle weakness can occur immediately after injury or develop over the first week after the injury. Patients who require mechanical ventilation are susceptible to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Over the first weeks to months after injury, many patients with partially intact diaphragm innervation acquire the ability to spontaneously ventilate, which is in part caused by strength recovery in the diaphragm. Approximately 7% of persons with SCI will be ventilator dependent when discharged from rehabilitation [7] . Patients with reduced inspiratory muscle strength are predisposed to microatelectasis, which may promote the development of pneumonia in atelectatic segments of the lung.",

Expiratory muscle weakness, resulting in low voluntary cough peak expiratory flow, is strongly associated with unsuccessful extubation and increased in-hospital mortality in the general population [8] . Because the primary expiratory muscles, the internal intercostals and abdominals, have thoracic innervation, they will be paralyzed completely in all patients with motor-complete tetraplegia. Expiratory strength increases incrementally with each additional neurologic level and is essentially normal at the T12 neurologic level and below; therefore, patients with high-level paraplegia have a similar degree of weakness to those with low-level tetraplegia. The main consequence of expiratory muscle weakness is a reduced peak cough flow, which is ineffective for clearance of bronchial secretions. With a peak cough flow of less than 2.7 L/sec (160 L/min), there is inadequate airflow to mobilize secretions out of the bronchi and trachea [9] . To compensate for weak cough strength, aggressive multimodal respiratory therapy interventions are required for secretion mobilization [10] . Measures to promote secretion mobilization are listed in Table 1 .",

The Pneumonia Patient Outcome Research Team (Pneumonia PORT) derived an algorithm for determining whether adults with CAP should be hospitalized or treated in the community, based on short-term mortality risk [22] . Patients are stratified into five severity classes, and outpatient treatment is generally recommended for the two lowest risk classes. To qualify for the lowest risk class, an adult would be age 50 years or less, have none of the important comorbidities (cancer, liver disease, congestive heart failure, renal disease, or cerebrovascular disease), have normal mental status, and have normal or only mildly abnormal vital signs. Patients in the two lowest risk categories are anticipated to have a short-term mortality risk of 0.5% or less. The rule is not meant to supersede clinical judgment, nor does it take into account other reasons for hospitalization besides the predicted risk of death from pneumonia.

Of the 41 patients, 32 (78%) were hospitalized and only 9 (22%) were treated as outpatients.

The antibiotic coverage received was in accordance with recommendations from the Infectious Disease Society of America for only one half of the patients [19] . After accounting for the relatively high rate of fluoroquinolone resistance at the participating institutions, only 24% of patients received reliable antipseudomonal coverage.

Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of invasive (ie, bacteremic) pneumococcal disease and is considered cost effective for elderly persons. It is also recommended for persons aged 2 years or older who have chronic illnesses including pulmonary diseases [38] . Based on these recommendations, it is routinely offered to persons with SCI, the majority of who have some degree of respiratory impairment. However, only a minority of pneumococcal pneumonias result in bacteremia. The vaccine has not been found to be effective for noninvasive disease, and in elderly patients the rate of CAP and pneumonia hospitalization is unaffected by pneumococcal vaccination [39] .",

A small proportion of patients, primarily those with cervical level injuries, appear to benefit from routine bronchial secretion clearance even in the absence of an acute respiratory infection. This typically can be achieved using quad coughing or mechanical insufflation-exsufflation on a daily basis. More commonly, assistance for secretion mobilization only becomes necessary when a respiratory infection develops. As noted earlier, viral upper respiratory infections or acute bronchitis may lead to subsequent development of pneumonia. Prompt clearance of bronchial secretions may prevent formation of microatelectasis, an increasing bacterial load in the lower respiratory tract, and the development of pneumonia.",

The rate of HAP in the general population is 5 to 15 per 1000 hospital admissions, and it is the leading cause of death for all hospital-acquired infections. Most findings on HAP have been derived from patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), because the risk of pneumonia is 6 to 20 times greater than in nonventilated patients. Risk factors for HAP in the general population include prolonged hospitalization, malnutrition, respiratory failure, sedating medications, dysphagia, central nervous system disorders, supine position during feeding, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the prolonged use of antibiotics [23] . The case fatality rate for HAP may be as high as 70% in certain subpopulations, such as mechanically ventilated patients, although only one third to one half of these deaths are directly attributable to the infection [23] .",

The sources of the multidrug-resistant pathogens include health care devices (especially respiratory care equipment), other fomites in the hospital environment, and other patients, and the pathogens are transferred to the patient during routine care.

Most published findings on pneumonia in persons with SCI come from patients undergoing acute care and initial rehabilitation at MSCIS hospitals. Jackson and Groomes [42] found a 31.4% rate of pneumonia during acute care and rehabilitation. Fishburn and colleagues [1] reported a combined rate of 50% for pneumonia or atelectasis during the first month after injury, with a 74% rate in patients with high-level tetraplegia. While receiving inpatient rehabilitation after acute care, 21.6% of patients with complete tetraplegia will have atelectasis or pneumonia [43] . Of note, 80% of pneumonias that develop soon after injury are left sided [1] . This has been attributed to difficulty with clearing secretions from the left bronchial tree using tracheal suctioning because of the more acute takeoff angle of the left mainstem bronchus.",

Clear secretions above the endotracheal tube cuff before deflating the cuff. Unless contraindicated, elevate the head of the bed to 30 to 45 degrees for patients at high risk of aspiration who are receiving enteral tube feedings (note: this is typically contraindicated in patients with SCI because of risk of pressure ulcer formation secondary to skin shearing). Prevent postoperative pneumonia Instruct preoperative high-risk patients on deep breathing exercises. Use incentive spirometry postoperatively.Remobilize patients out of bed as soon as medically feasible.Diagnostic proceduresObtain chest radiographs to assist with confirming the diagnosis, assessing the severity, and ruling out associated complications such as pleural effusions. Obtain lower respiratory tract cultures. TreatmentInitiate appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics as early as possible.Antibiotics should be chosen based on duration of hospitalization and the likelihood of multidrug-resistant antibiotics. Empiric antibiotics should include agents from a different antibiotic class than the patient has received recently. Consider narrowing the antibiotic coverage based on results of lower respiratory tract cultures and the patient's clinical response. For patients with uncomplicated pneumonia and a good clinical response to initially appropriate antibiotic therapy, consider a shorter treatment course (7 to 8 days) in the absence of nonfermenting gram-negative rods (eg, Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter). Perform serial assessments to monitor the clinical response. Patients who have not improved within 72 hours should be evaluated for noninfectious mimics of pneumonia, drug-resistant organisms, other sites of infection, and complications of pneumonia or its treatment, such as emphysema or clostridium difficile colitis.Note: these recommendations are based on research performed in non-SCI patient populations. Except as noted, they are likely to apply to persons with acute or chronic SCI who have HAP or HCAP.Data from American Thoracic Society and Infectious Disease Society of America.
