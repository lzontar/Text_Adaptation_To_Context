Three out of eight inoculated cats developed neurological signs and non-suppurative encephalitis; all three recovered from the acute stage of disease. Sero-conversion and the development of neutralizing antibodies occurred in all of the virus-inoculated cats. In addition, cats inoculated with feline BDV showed an early peripheral T cell response not present in cats inoculated with BDV strain V, suggesting that the feline virus exerted a more vigorous effect on the immune system. Using immunohistochemistry and a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, BDV-specific antigen and nucleic acid could be demonstrated in brain samples from each cat with encephalitis, showing that incomplete viral clearance was probably responsible for the maintenance of inflammation. The successful induction of neurological signs and encephalitis in one cat infected with feline BDV, together with the detection of BDV-specific antigen and nucleic acid in the brain, provides strong evidence for the notion that BDV is the etiological agent behind feline SD.",

Since the natural route of infection in cats is unknown, we chose to inoculate the animals intracerebrally to ensure viral access to the CNS. Of a total of eight inoculated cats, three developed definite neurological signs and encephalitis. Two of these were infected with BDV strain V and one with feline BDV. The distribution pattern of inflammatory lesions in the present cats considerably differs from that in natural BD of horses, as well as that in feline SD, both of which show predilection for the limbic system and the brain stem [9, 20] . One possible explanation for this may be the route of inoculation. As indicated by the periventricular localization of lesions in one of the cats inoculated with BDV strain V, spread of virus following intracerebral administration probably occurred via the CSF and the ventricles. Another explanation for the atypical distribution pattern in the present cats could be that histopathological examination was carried out only during the chronic stage (between 5 and 6 months p.i.), when the inflammatory reaction would be expected to be less prominent. In contrast, cats with natural SD usually are killed and examined post mortem at the peak of clinical disease and encephalitis.",

In this context, it is of interest that inflammatory brain infiltrates in experimental rabies of cats typically involve plasma cells in close association with neurons [27, 31] .

Interestingly, recovery from the acute stage of disease in this cat coincided with a rise in neutralizing antibody titers, a phenomenon previously observed in experimentally infected rats [18] . In the other two cats with neurological signs, a correlation between clinical recovery and the appearance of neutralizing antibodies was less clear. Neutralizing antibodies in BD are thought to be directed against the 18-kDa viral glycoprotein [12, 35] , and have been shown to prevent BDV spread in infected cell cultures in vitro [19] . However, the functional role of such antibodies in vivo awaits further elucidation.",

It is of interest to note that BDV mRNA was present in the spleen, but not in the brain, of one of the cats.

Clearly, further studies are necessary to understand the pathogenesis of BDV infection in cats. Of special importance would be to investigate the clinical and immunological outcome of the infection when other, more natural, inoculation routes (for instance intranasally) are used. However, the successful induction of neurological signs and encephalitis in one cat intracerebrally inoculated with feline BDV, together with the detection of BDV antigen and nucleic acid in the brain of this cat, provides strong evidence for the notion that BDV is the etiological agent behind feline SD.",
