This is related partially with the occurrence of the AIDS epidemic [2, 3] together with an increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB in some countries [1] . However, the number of TB cases has declined in the United States since 1992 due to TB-prevention and TB-control programs [4] . In all cases pulmonary TB remains a common disease. Nonwhite people, socioeconomically disadvantaged and chronically debilitated groups are the most concerned. Chest radiography remains the first imaging modality to evaluate thoracic TB. In all cases, widely radiographic appearances of the disease [1] must always be kept in mind, including normal chest X-ray. A clear distinction between primary and postprimary TB may be impossible to make in the absence of prior chest imaging or, more importantly, a recent history of exposure or skin-test conversion [5] . However, some radiological findings that are seen in either type, such as cavitation or miliary disease, are of greater clinical importance than the type of disease itself [6] . Computed tomography is generally required to detect fine lesions overlooked on standard chest radiographs [7] , to define equivocal lesions, or to analyze complications. Moreover, high-resolution CT has been proved helpful in judging the activity of TB [2] , which cannot be accurately assessed by chest radiography alone.",

Some sites are preferentially secondarily infected, particularly the subapical regions of the lung. In 90\u00b195 % of subjects, development of immunity results in healing of the lesions, with development of pulmonary and hilar granulomas. Healing of larger parenchymal lesions may leave fibrous scars or persistent nodules known as tuberculomas, both of which may calcify [6] .

Such an endobronchial spread may occur in the absence of radiographically demonstrable cavitation [5] . In the series by Im et al. [16] , centrilobular nodules or branching linear structure 2\u00b14 mm in diameter on CT scans were the earliest CT finding of bronchogenic dissemination. These lesions had sharp margins and relatively high attenuation. Centrilobular lesions consisted of solid caseation material within or around the terminal or respiratory bronchioles. Multiple branching linear structures of similar caliber that originated from a single stalk \u00b1 the \u00aatree-in-bud\u00ba appearance \u00b1 were commonly seen in patients with extensive bronchogenic spread, the stalk thought to represent a lesion that affects the last-order bronchus within the secondary pulmonary lobule and the bud thought to represent lesions in the bronchioles and alveolar ducts [16] . A classic radiographic finding also suggestive of bronchogenic dissemination consists of multiple fluffy nodules approximately 5 mm in diameter. Several authors proved that such le-sions which were originally described as acinar nodules actually corresponded to peribronchiolar lesions. Bronchiolar lesions and \u00aaacinar\u00ba nodules which are very suggestive of TB in the appropriate clinical setting may also be encountered in different kinds of bronchiolitis, in bronchiectasis with mucoid impaction, as well as in some infiltrative lung disease with \u00aagranulomatous bronchiolitis.\u00ba Bronchial wall thickening and lobular consolidation were the other signs encountered in the series by Im et al. [16] . Large areas of consolidation on pathological examination manifested as areas of lobular and lobar consolidation on CT scans. Lobular consolidation consisted of centrally located granulomas that contained caseation necrosis and marginal nonspecific inflammation. In another study, ground-glass pattern, poorly marginated nodules and septal thickening were present only before treatment (Fig. 7 ) [17] .",

Their resolution was followed by various degrees of fibrosis with healing of cavities (see later) [16] . Notably, endobronchial disease is associated with endarteritis obliterans, resulting from parallel reductions of ventila- tion and perfusion. In the series by Long et al. [18] , a mosaic pattern of reduced lung attenuation located in diseased lung was present in all patients with cavitary disease. Areas of reduced lung attenuation are presumably a result of gas trapping, hypoxic vasoconstriction and vascular injury. The later mechanism is related to the extensive in situ pulmonary arterial thrombosis in areas of parenchymal destruction produced by M. tuberculosis [18] .

Emphysema results mainly from traction (paracicatricial emphysema) and/or from obstruction of air passages secondary to fibrotic stenosis of the bronchioles [16] . In the series by Long et al., bronchiectasis were more likely to complicate cavitary than noncavitary disease (64 vs 11 %) [18] . Severe fibrosis with upper lobe volume loss, hilar retraction and secondary tracheomegaly is seen in up to 29 % of cases [6] . An apical cap is also frequently observed as sequelae. The hypertrophied extrapleural fat is mainly responsible and to a lesser degree pleural thickening with subpleural atelectasic and fibrotic lung (Figs. 17) [26] . Cavities, which usually heal with closure, are rarely completely obliterated by scar. Moreover, encapsulated caseous material can persist for years.

Common causes of missed diagnosis of primary TB were failure to recognise hilar and mediastinal adenopathy or isolated findings of parenchymal consolidation, atelectasis or pleural effusion as manifestations of primary disease in adults. In the same series, findings of postprimary TB was overlooked in 40 % of cases. Incorrect appraisal of disease activity was the most common cause of misdi- In primary TB, CT is used to help identify or confirm the presence of adenopathy [9] and to detect subtle parenchymal sites of primary infection that may be inconspicuous on plain radiographs and may suggest the diagnosis of TB.

In all cases CT should be proposed at the end of an effective antituberculous treatment to better detect fine lesions suggestive of active disease, thereby allowing a prompt diagnosis of reactivation TB. This medium-sized hardcover book encompasses all technical and clinical aspects of interventional ultrasound in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. The obstetrical part of the book starts with an original chapter on the ethical framework for interventional ultrasound. The authors provide a list of criteria which allow clinicians and radiologists to estimate whether or not a new procedure or technique might be beneficial to the fetal and maternal condition. This chapter is particularly welcome as the book covers subjects such as pregnancy reduction methods, invasive procedures in multiple pregnancies, fetal biopsy and puncture. The`how-to' approach of the book appears most helpful in chapters such as diagnosis and management of fetal heart disease, for which practical and didactical papers are missing. Many authors, international experts in their fields, explain the place of sonography among the choices of diagnostic tests and insist on the appropriate diagnosis of any fetal condition before deletary actions are undertaken. Fetal biopsy techniques are also discussed and presented with detailed tables on normal values as a function of weeks of gestation.",

The last provides a good overview of the specific indication for each approach as well as possible complications. Although two chapters deal with cyst aspiration of the ovary, none clearly answers the controversial question of whether to perform a cyst aspiration and for what indication. One author proposes a decision tree using the patient's age, Doppler arterial waveform analysis and a sonographic score for the morphological appearance of the tumor. Unfortunately the cited score is not universally accepted and threshold values for arterial waveform analysis are missing. A conclusion of the different clinical scenarios is missing, but it appears that only sonographically benign-appearing tumors should undergo cyst aspiration, regardless of the patient's age.",

For that purpose it is subdivided into two major parts: radionuclides in the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors, and special techniques and radiopharmaceuticals. Overall, there is too much emphasis on nuclear medicine imaging techniques which are currently used in virtually all institutions worldwide and, therefore, are extremely well known to the target audience of the book. The impact of the content would have benefited tremendously from a concise overview of new knowledge and new results regarding the use of nuclear medicine techniques in oncology. For example, including 67 Ga scintigraphy in the diagnosis and staging of lymphoma adds volume to the chapter but is not really significant to the readership because there is nothing new about it, and its obvious limitations are not clearly set out. The same issue applies to agents such as 201 Tl and 99m Tc-MIBI. Further, the public has become aware about the facts of exposure to ionizing radiation, and, whenever a short-lived isotope can replace a long-lived one to reduce the radiation burden, reservations about the method used can be reduced in both the patient and the referring physician, increasing the acceptance of the method. In addition, it is well known to the readership that an imaging approach based on inexpensive agents (see above, and even some published journal articles) may not represent state-of-the-art diagnostics for proper patient management. In general, less but well-focused information about the developments in nuclear oncology would have been of more value to the reader.",
