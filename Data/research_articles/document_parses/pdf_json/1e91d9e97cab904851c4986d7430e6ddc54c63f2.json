Rehabilitation will be needed for survivors of COVID-19, many of whom are older, with underlying health problems. In addition, rehabilitation will be needed for those who have become deconditioned as a result of movement restrictions, social isolation, and inability to access healthcare for pre-existing or new non-COVID-19 illnesses. Delivering rehabilitation in the same way as before the pandemic will not be practical, nor will this approach meet the likely scale of need for rehabilitation. This commentary reviews the likely rehabilitation needs of older people both with and without COVID-19 and discusses how strategies to deliver effective rehabilitation at scale can be designed and implemented in a world living with COVID-19.",

In combination, these issues risk worsening health, physical and psychological function for millions of older people who have not suffered from COVID-19 infection directly. As movement restrictions are lifted, the consequences of these indirect effects of the pandemic will become apparent, with the release of pent-up demand for rehabilitation services.

Rehabilitation services should, however, be able to identify those discharged from hospital with COVID-19 and those with a diagnosis of COVID-19 made in primary care. As COVID-19 testing is rolled out across populations at scale, the results will provide a platform for targeting a wider range of older people in need of specific post-COVID rehabilitation.",

Anecdotal data from the UK suggest an even greater percentage of people may require rehabilitation [12] in inpatient or intermediate care settings.

In countries where current rehabilitation services are fragmented or siloed, there is an opportunity to redesign pathways that better reflect the patient journey [17, 18] , from home to hospital and back again. Where services are narrowly focussed on hospitals, there is an opportunity to put services in primary care and the community centre-stage, and to engineer better collaboration with agencies outside healthcare. These integrated systems of rehabilitation are more likely to prove resilient to future pandemic waves and are likely to be more responsive to the needs of those requiring both acute hospital admission and those requiring community rehabilitation without admission. It is likely that care will need to be delivered close to home, and to be effective, teams must work across organisational boundaries. These principles underpin the NHS Right Care Community rehabilitation toolkit (2020) [17] , which sets out a vision for how community rehabilitation should be planned, commissioned and delivered in the UK.",

This will not be achieved simply by training more specialist practitioners who will take several years to enter the workforce; a more diverse rehabilitation workforce will be required to meet the scale of this challenge, using capacity and skills from sectors outside healthcare organisations. By stratifying rehabilitation need and matching approaches to the right profession, the right mix of skills can be deployed to the right person. For example, older people at risk of falls would be able to access community-based specialist exercise instructor-led exercise programmes, with more complex cases managed by therapy services. This increase in capacity can also be achieved by developing rehabilitation capabilities across the wider non-registered health care staff, including specialist trained exercise and sports science professionals, to help meet both demand and effective dose and progression of exercise [19] . Professional leadership is needed to drive clinical expertise and system improvement across these multiple pathways [8] .",

This will mean changes in how rehabilitation is deliveredapproaches involving travel or group work are likely to be especially vulnerable to future pandemic waves or the imposition of movement restrictions. Early investment in digital connectivity to support rehabilitation must therefore continue, particularly in rural areas; such investments will also help not only to develop a system that is resilient to future pandemic waves, but also to permanent changes in how we live if the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 becomes endemic. The pandemic response has brought opportunities as well as challenges-for instance highlighting how physical activity and exercise can be integrated into daily life via remote communication. This must be now be scaled up to support older people, care home residents and others who are currently (or may in future be) confined to their own homes with limited social contact. Even where face-to-face delivery of rehabilitation is able to restart, it is likely that more of this activity will need to happen remotely to enable efficient delivery of rehabilitation at scale.",

Although models of care will be developed and implemented at speed, evaluation must accompany implementation, with rapid dissemination of results. Key areas for research will need to include ascertainment of the number of people in need of rehabilitation, severity and type of deficits, the longterm impact of the pandemic and of unmet rehabilitation need and evaluation of novel modes of delivery, including the use of online and digital resources. Older people have lower levels of digital literacy and are less likely to have access to the internet; they may be living with sensory loss and/or cognitive impairment and not all will understand English. It is important that novel solutions to rehabilitation delivery do not create new groups of disadvantaged or excluded older people, and it is equally important that new services accurately identify those in need of rehabilitation and match service delivery to their needs.",

Research funding has been made available across the world to develop a greater understanding of the effects of COVID-19, and it is incumbent on all clinicians involved in rehabilitation to participate in, and advocate for rehabilitation research. COVID-19 has demonstrated the pace and scale with which complex trials and other research studies can be set up and delivered, and there is a real opportunity here to make sure that through research, we build better rehabilitation services both for older people with COVID-19 and those whose need now is just as great as it was before the pandemic.",
