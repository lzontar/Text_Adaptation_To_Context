            "text": "Deep generative models have enabled the automated synthesis of high-quality data for diverse applications. However, the most effective generative models are specialized to data from a single domain (e.g., images or text). Real-world applications such as healthcare require multi-modal data from multiple domains (e.g., both images and corresponding text), which are difficult to acquire due to limited availability and privacy concerns and are much harder to synthesize. To tackle this joint synthesis challenge, we propose an End-to-end MultImodal X-ray genERative model (EMIXER) for jointly synthesizing x-ray images and corresponding free-text reports, all conditional on diagnosis labels. EMIXER is an conditional generative adversarial model by 1) generating an image based on a label, 2) encoding the image to a hidden embedding, 3) producing the corresponding text via a hierarchical decoder from the image embedding, and 4) a joint discriminator for assessing both the image and the corresponding text. EMIXER also enables self-supervision to leverage vast amount of unlabeled data. Extensive experiments with real Xray reports data illustrate how data augmentation using synthesized multimodal samples can improve the performance of a variety of supervised tasks including COVID-19 X-ray classification with very limited samples. The quality of generated images and reports are also confirmed by radiologists. We quantitatively show that EMIXER generated synthetic datasets can augment X-ray image classification, report generation models to achieve 5.94% and 6.9% improvement on models trained only on real data samples. Taken together, our results highlight the promise of state of generative models to advance clinical machine learning.",

            "text": "While clinical applications of supervised machine learning algorithms continue to advance, their impact is stifled by the limited amount of available labeled clinical data. This issue only made more dire by applications such as radiology report generation for medical images, which require paired data jointly across images, clinical notes, and diagnosis labels. Data sharing across healthcare organizations and institutions remains difficult, often due to legal and privacy concerns [1, 2] . On the other hand, generative modeling has improved dramatically in the past few years. While early Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) could only synthesize low-resolution grayscale images [3] , Preprint . Under review. state-of-art generative models can now synthesize diverse high-quality and high-resolution images [4, 5, 6, 7] . GANs and related generative models have been applied to various domains such as computer vision [4, 5] , natural language processing [8, 9] , time-series synthesis [10] , semantic segmentation [11, 12] , among others. This manuscript explores using generative models to address the challenge of limited data in machine learning for clinical applications. We explore a variety of applications, with a focus on using synthetic data to augment real datasets -increasing the amount of the data and labels available [13] , thereby improving downstream model performance.",

Recent research efforts have shown promise for lung cancer detection in radiology, prostate cancer in pathology, and differential diagnoses in dermatology [16, 17, 18, 19] . Most recently, X-rays have been employed for the coronavirus diagnosis and prognosis [20] . Along with X-rays, associated reports written by clinicians are the primary communication between patients and doctors [21, 22] . Several deep learning based X-ray image to report writing method been proposed [23, 24, 25] . Researchers have proposed generative models for clinical data [13] . However, existing methods are limited to a single modality -images, or clinical reports only. Thus, current generative models are not able to produce high quality multimodal synthetic datasets, which is the focus of this paper. This manuscript investigates an end-to end approach for generating multimodal X-ray images and text reports which are essential for the radiology applications. To this end, our work addresses the following challenges.",

Since the introduction of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), there have been many variants proposed such as DCGAN, Progressive GAN, Self-supervised GANs [3, 5, 35, 36] , among others. In addition to GANs, other types of generative models are also quite widely used such as Flow Models, Autoregressive Models, and variational autoencoders [37, 38, 39, 40] . Flow Models uses a stack of invertible transformations to a sample from prior distributions, thus can compute the exact log-likelihoods of observations. Autoregressive models factorize the distribution over observations into a sequence of conditional distributions (e.g. over pixels for images), then process each component in sequence [41, 42] . For image generation applications, GAN-based models produce among the photo-realistic images. However, the training of GAN models can be quite challenging with known issues such as mode collapse and instability in convergence [43] . There have been many works to improve upon these challenges, e.g., by changing the objective function [44] . Some other research efforts have focused on constraining the discriminator through gradient penalties or normalization [45] . BigGAN [46, 4] adds the self-attention block, and ProGAN considers training a single model across a sequence of increasing resolutions [5] . While there is a lot of effort in modeling single modalities especially images, there is a dearth of research on multimodal image and text generation.This work addresses the challenge of multimodal joint generation of image and text.",

An X-ray image generator is a deep neural network that accepts two inputs; a noise vector z \u2208 R dz and class information y represented as one-hot vector. First, we split the noise vector z to obtain z spl \u2208 R 20 vectors. The vectors z spl is passed through a linear layer to obtain z in , z in = W l z spl +b l . We embed the class information y via a linear layer to obtain y emb \u2208 R 128 . z in concatenated with y emb is passed through three layers of residual-block which applies batch-normalization with deconvolution operation, res out = res-block(z in , y emb ) [50] . The output res out is passed through a self-attention block which applies applies a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution operation with softmax to obtain intermediate feature vectors which are combined with the original input to compute the att-block, att out = self-att-block(res out ).

We also use multiple discriminators to guide the process of image generation, report decoding. We show via extensive experiments that EMIXER can augment real x-ray image datasets to improve downstream classification tasks.
