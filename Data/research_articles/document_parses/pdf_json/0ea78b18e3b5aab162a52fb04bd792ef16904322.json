Ling et al and Xiao et al reported persistent viral shedding in stool even after the nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative. 14, 15 The presence of GI symptoms may lead to increased exposure duration and greater viral burden, and thus GI symptoms may serve as a proxy for a more severely infected patient. Furthermore, studies on ACE2 receptor expression suggest that ACE2 is highly expressed not only in the respiratory tract, but also in the esophagus and absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon. 3 Thus, the GI tract may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, and more extrapulmonary involvement might suggest a more severe disseminated viral course and potentially more inflammation and cytokine release, thereby contributing to multiorgan involvement and ARDS, as was suggested by our findings. 16 There are limitations to our meta-analysis. It is based on retrospective observational studies published on this topic at this time; however, given the paucity of literature and conflicting results from available studies on the prognostic significance of GI involvement amidst this unprecedented rapidly evolving pandemic, this can be a source of confusion for clinicians caring for these patients. Our study addresses this important issue of GI tract involvement by SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on clinical outcomes and shows a significant association with ARDS. Our findings will help clinicians triage patients better in resource-limited settings, especially with regards to hospital admission and level of care.
