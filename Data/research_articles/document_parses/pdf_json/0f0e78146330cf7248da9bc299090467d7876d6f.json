Whether the atypical E. coli infections in association with PEMS is a primary or secondary infection remains to be determined.

Indeed, feed consumption was depressed within 24 h postinfection with virulent E. coli (Tian and Baracos, 1989 ) and remained depressed for at least 25 d after infection similar to the PEMS problem associated with field outbreaks. Leitner and Heller (1992) noted that a brief period of inanition at 5 d of age resulted in rapid penetration of the intestine by virulent E. coli causing bacteremia and colonization of liver and spleen of poults. Thus, this suggests that the atypical E. coli strains, which are known to have binding and penetrating ability for avian epithelial cells, have an opportunity to translocate from the intestine to the viscera causing septicemia during the time when PEMSafflicted poults exhibit feed refusal but are eating litter that can be heavily ladened with atypical E. coli colony Types 1 and 2 (Edens et al., unpublished data).

This conclusion is based upon observations of elevated feed conversion ratios in PEMS poults (Barnes and Guy, 1995; Brown, 1995; Barnes et al., 1996; Edens, unpublished data) . It appears clear that part of the reduction in weight gain can be attributed largely to the inability of the infected poults to absorb nutrient from the chymal content of the intestine. Furthermore, the observation that there are large numbers of macrophages that migrate through the intestinal epithelium cells to phagocytize bacteria in the lumen of the ileum suggests that in cases of secretory diarrhea both transcellular and paracellular exudation of body fluids might occur which would exacerbate the diarrhea and dehydration associated with PEMS.

Perhaps, the presentation of the killed organisms at 1 d, before the intestinal epithelial cells seal and form a barrier to invasion of microorganisms, allowed the immature immune system in the intestinal tract to rapidly process antigenic information presented by the heat-killed bacterial cells. This would be consistent with the observations that even in ovo administration of antigen can stimulate early immune response in chickens (Sharma, 1986; Williams et al., 1992) . This finding suggests that antigenic sites on the killed bacterial cell membranes or in the cytoplasm can induce an immune response that can be protective to the poults regardless of the level of and kinds of maternal antibodies passed to the poult.
