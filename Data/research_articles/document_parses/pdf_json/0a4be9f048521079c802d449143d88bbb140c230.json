An exploratory query indicated that reporting frequency could be improved to every six weeks. However, to be better optimised for a SARI surveillance system for preparedness and emergency control, timeliness has to be improved to at least a weekly reporting frequency. During the current COVID-19 pandemic NICE was quickly modified for COVID-19 monitoring with several updates per day. The financial coding system comprised a passive, syndromic SARI surveillance system, which is evaluated as good for timeliness, simplicity and acceptability. Passive surveillance systems, such as fully automated cluster detection systems, are the preferred design for SARI surveillance, because they minimize administrative burden and increase sustainability.",

However, it could be of potential value in complementing another surveillance system or dataset, such as syndromic SARI sentinel surveillance. In comparison, Denmark has a national microbiology database available, with national legislation that allows for linkage with other patient data. 37",

In terms of sustainability, several challenges play an essential role. Firstly, the administrative burden associated with surveillance should be addressed. In a demanding hospital setting with increasing registration burden for hospital staff 45 , our experience from SARI sentinel surveillance indicated that additional workload associated with surveillance should be decreased as much as possible. Thus, to improve timeliness, simplicity, and acceptability of a SARI surveillance system, we believe that implementation of a passive, fully or semi-automated, SARI surveillance system is required. This is underlined by high scores evaluations scores for mortality monitoring and virological laboratory surveillance, which are largely automated surveillance systems as well. Secondly, a different appreciation of the value of epidemiological surveillance data by data providers, such as clinicians, laboratories or hospitals, should be taken into account. We experienced that stakeholders withdrew their participation in SARI surveillance after a year, because of different appreciation of the value of epidemiological surveillance data. Therefore, we believe it is essential that a SARI surveillance system serves both a public health and a patient care goal. 46 This could be achieved by integrating SARI surveillance in existing hospital programs in order to make surveillance data valuable for public health as well as patient care. 48 SARI surveillance data could for example be utilised for monitoring antibiotic or antiviral use and resistance and lead to targeted antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) interventions in patient care. 49 Embedding SARI surveillance in a quality of care program for SARI patients is a strategy that was pursued in our SARI sentinel surveillance. 8, 50 Being part of routine quality care helped improve efficiency of our SARI sentinel surveillance system and increased the commitment of the participating hospital.",

Therefore, we aim to establish a separate laboratory surveillance system for influenza, RSV, S. pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2, parallel to passive syndromic surveillance.

Retrospective ambulance dispatch calls data are analysed for potential use for a real-time, syndromic surveillance system of acute respiratory infections. A SARI case is detected if the patient adheres to specific triage codes related to respiratory syndrome calls. The data are provided in aggregated format.
