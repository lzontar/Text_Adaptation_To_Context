We analyze the change in world-wide mobility at multiple spatio-temporal resolutions -county, state, country -using an anonymized aggregate mobility map that captures population flows between geographic cells of size 5 km 2 . We show that human mobility underwent an abrupt and significant change, partly in response to the interventions, resulting in 87% reduction of international travel and up to 75% reduction of domestic travel. Taking two very different countries sampled from the global spectrum, we observe a maximum reduction of 42% in mobility across different states of the United States (US), and a 68% reduction across the states of India between late March and late April. Since then, there has been an uptick in flows, with the US seeing 53% increase and India up to 38% increase with respect to flows seen during the lockdown. As we overlay this global map with epidemic incidence curves and dates of government interventions, we observe that as case counts rose, mobility fell -often before stay-at-home orders were issued. Further, in order to understand mixing within a region, we propose a new metric to quantify the effect of social distancing on the basis of mobility. We find that population mixing has decreased considerably as the pandemic has progressed and are able to measure this effect across the world. Finally, we carry out a counterfactual analysis of delaying the lockdown and show that a one week delay would have doubled the reported number of cases in the US and India.

The pandemic has affected almost every country in the world 3 and has resulted in an unprecedented response by governments across the world to control its spread. Pharmaceutical interventions are not generally available at this stage (with the exception of remdesivir under FDA's expanded access [1] ) and thus, countries have had to rely exclusively on behavioral interventions that involve some form of social distancing. The rapid spread of the pandemic has forced countries to institute strict social distancing measures. Each social distancing policy is characterized by: (i) when and how gradually it started, (ii) the length of time for which it was enforced, (iii) the scope and pervasiveness, and (iv) the stringency (total lockdown versus stay-at-home advisories). For example, across the US, social distancing policies were instituted at the state level in a progressive manner: a declaration of a state of emergency by many states, followed by school closures, with the final extreme measure being stay-athome or shelter-at-home orders (SAHO) [2] , which saw the closure of recreational centers, parks, restaurant dine-in services, etc. As a contrast, a country-wide lockdown was instituted in India which subsequently led to suspended road, rail, and air transport.

With appropriate data-sharing policies, these data sources can be used to study social distancing, while also ensuring individual privacy through a combination of anonymization, aggregation and noising techniques that provide the needed privacy guarantees. There have been a number of recent studies along these lines, for example, in China using Baidu data, in the US using mobility data, and at a global scale using airline traffic [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] The Google COVID-19 Aggregated Mobility Research Dataset (cf.

While FRR measures the reduction in connectivity of a region to the outside world, SDI measures the change in mixing within the region. Additionally we use a case growth rate (CGR) and effective reproductive number (R eff ) to quantify the corresponding changes in case incidence. Flow Reduction Rate (FRR): One way to measure the impact of social distancing is to compare the levels of connectivity before and after the SAHO/lockdowns.

Note that FRR is scale-agnostic and can be computed for a county, state or country. Social Distancing Index (SDI): In order to quantify the mixing or movement within a county, we consider the flows between the 5 km 2 cells in it. This is motivated by the fact that, under extreme case of social distancing (i.e., stay-at-home), the inter-cell flows will be significantly reduced. Let V denote the set of cells within a county. Let F(t) denote the normalized flow matrix of the county at week t with normalized flow from cell i to cell j defined as F ij (t) = fij (t) j\u2208V fij (t) . We compare F(t) to two matrices, the uniform matrix U and the identity matrix I. The uniform matrix with entries U ij = 1 |V | , where |V | is the cardinality or the number of cells in V denotes equiprobable movement between cells and indicates a scenario of high level of mixing or movement between cells.

To simulate and compare the effect of a delayed intervention, we consider two counterfactual scenarios which involve one-week delay and a two-week delay in imposing said interventions.

Some of the increase in cases is likely due to the increased testing in US and India.

Testing in India as well as the US was largely confined to individuals reporting to clinics with symptoms. Nevertheless, we believe our results show significant correlation patterns between human mobility and COVID-19 dynamics. It also provides a clear evidence of the abrupt changes in mobility patterns across the world in relatively small time window. The mobility map, like other such data sets, have a bias based on device ownership, when the devices are used, etc. For instance, Google mobility data is limited to smartphone users who have opted in to Google's consumer Location History feature, which is off by default. These data may not be representative of the population as a whole, and furthermore their representativeness may vary by location. Importantly, these limited data are only viewed through the lens of differential privacy algorithms, specifically designed to protect user anonymity and obscure fine detail. Moreover, comparisons across rather than within locations are only descriptive since these regions can differ in substantial ways. We did not observe large MF between states due to migratory workers at the start of the lock down period (as well as during lock down period) in India. This can be potentially due to relative flow volumes needed to maintain differential privacy and ownership bias.
