            "text": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 which causes the acute respiratory illness known as COVID-19 has been characterized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic since March 13, 2020. Despite a lower case-fatality rate, COVID-19 has resulted in significantly more deaths than SARS in 2003, largely in part due to its higher infectivity. As of May 21, 2020, more than 4,800,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 321,000 fatalities. Singapore confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on January 23, 2020. Since then, we have had a total of 29,342 cases and 22 fatalities. Majority of the hospitalized cases were treated at our center, the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (NCID).",

[1] [2] [3] We sought to assess the lymphocyte subset alterations in COVID-19 patients, in particular the differences between critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and general ward patients. As the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections increases throughout the world, healthcare systems are being overwhelmed. Hence, it is increasingly important to appropriately triage COVID-19 patients and identify those who would need ICU care early.",

Lymphocyte subsets namely CD3+/ CD4+/CD8+T-cell, CD19+B-cell, and CD16+CD56+ NK cell counts (cells/\u00b5L) were measured by multicolor flow cytometry, using the following reagents: human monoclonal anti-CD3-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-CD8-phycoerythrin (PE), anti-CD4-allophycocyanin (APC), anti-CD19-APC, anti-CD16+CD56 PE, and anti-CD45-peridinin-chlorophyll-protein (PerCP) antibodies. Cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCanto TM II Flow analyzer. A complete blood count (CBC) and differential count were also performed on a Beckman Coulter DxH800 analyzer. All non-ICU patients had CBC, differential counts, and lymphocyte sub- In mice depleted of CD8+ T cells, RSV replication in the nose appears to be prolonged. 7 In humans, RSV infection was more severe in immunocompromised children with T-cell defects, and they experienced prolonged viral shedding compared to immunologically normal children. 8 Following natural H7N9 infection, the reduction in IFN-\u03b3 + CD8 T cells correlated with clinical recovery. 9 Additionally, we found that NK cells were significantly reduced in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients and could also be a useful predictor of clinical severity. Our study echoes the findings by Wang F et al, 12 where they described the lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 and found significantly lower total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells in \"severe cases\" compared to \"mild cases.\" However, in contrast to our study, the CD4/8 ratio and NK cells were not found to be significantly different between the two groups. Wan S et al 13 showed only statistically significant differences in CD4+ and CD8+",

Firstly, as it is a retrospective study, blood tests were performed sporadically throughout the admission and not at specified time points. Secondly, we acknowledge that treatments administered such as steroids can influence lymphocyte subsets, and this could potentially confound our results. In conclusion, we found statistically significant differences in lymphocyte subsets between ICU and non-ICU patients. We also found that peripheral lymphocyte subset alterations are associated with the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Possible predictors of severity include reduction in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells, as well as an increased CD4/8 ratio.",

The aforementioned tests were also performed on ICU patients, with the first sample taken within the first week of admission for most (17 out of 20) of the ICU patients. These laboratory markers were repeated in ICU patients during their hospitalization to monitor their progress. In addition, we had previously performed the above tests on 19 healthy subjects for comparison. Information such as age, sex, gender, race, and clinical history was obtained from the electronic medical records.Most of our patients were Chinese (69.3%) and male (66.7%), with a median age of 50. Leucopenia was seen in 16.0% of patients, lymphopenia in 48.0%, neutrophilia in 14.7%, and thrombocytopenia in 4.0%. 20 out of 75 COVID-19 patients (26.7%) had severe illness requiring admission to the ICU. Criteria for admission to the ICU were based on the clinical assessment of patients by the ICU team. All patients were transferred to the ICU for ventilatory support or for severe metabolic acidosis. All 20 ICU patients had chest X-ray changes in keeping with pneumonia, 19 out of 20 required supplemental oxygen, and 16 out of 20 patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. ICU patients were older by 20 years (median age of 64 compared to 44), with significantly higher leucocytes ((11.20 vs 2.03), and lower hemoglobin (10.9 g/dL vs 14.5 g/dL) compared to non-ICU patients. Looking at lymphocyte subsets, compared to healthy subjects, COVID-19 patients in general had significantly lower total lymphocytes (1072 vs 1787 cells/\u00b5L, P < .001), CD4+cells (408 vs 662 cells/ \u00b5l, P < .001), CD8+cells (278 vs 562 cells/\u00b5L, P < .001), B cells (119 vs 308 cells/\u00b5L, P < .001), and NK cells (182 vs 258 cells/\u00b5L, P = .017). CD4+/8+ratio was not significantly different. Compared to non-ICU patients, ICU patients had significantly lower total lymphocytes (514 vs 1352 cells/\u00b5l, P < .001), CD4+T cells (190 vs 464 cells/ul, P < .001), CD8+T cells (86 vs 355 cells/\u00b5L, P < .001), NK cells (68 vs 205 cells/\u00b5L, P < .001), and B cells (97 vs 142 cells/\u00b5L, P = .010). CD4/8 ratio was also significantly higher in the ICU patients (1.80 vs 1.28, P = .037). Categorical variables were compared using either Pearson's chisquare or Fischer's exact tests. Nonparametric comparative tests (Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney) were used to compare continuous variables across groups. All statistical analyses were conducted either using SPSS or GraphPad Prism with significance defined as P < .05. In our study, total lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, and NK cells were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients as compared to healthy subjects, suggesting a correlation between lymphocyte subset alteration and the pathogenesis of SARs-CoV-2. These findings were similarly seen in patients with SARS. 4 Among COVID-19 patients, ICU patients had significantly lower total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+T cells, and B cells. In the study by Wong RS et al on SARS, 5 they similarly found that low CD4 and CD8 counts at presentation were associated with adverse outcomes. The significantly lower CD8+ T cells and higher CD4/8 ratio seen in our group of ICU patients indicate that CD8+ T cells are TA B L E 1 Comparisons of demographic and clinical characteristics between icu and non-icu patients",
