WHO (World Health Organization) declared this as a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern) in the end of January 2020. After the initial delay in the source point (Wuhan), Chinese authorities took utmost efforts to control the spread of the disease, however, it has already started impacting other parts of China as well as other countries during mid to end of January. A term \"infodemic\" has been used by the WHO Director General at the initial stage of the spread of the disease (during mid-January 2020: [1] in Lancet), which seems to be still valid while writing the paper in the end of March 2020. WHO colleagues have warned the tsunami of information, especially with social media, which many times call for panic situation. We have observed this in several countries, as well as fake news spreading through social media. On 11th of March 2020, WHO has declared this as a global pandemic, and as of 23rd of March 2020, the virus has affected 172 out of 195 countries.",

While China, Korea, Japan has relatively high recovery rate, Europe, Iran, USA showed relatively lower recovery rate. Of course, this is constantly changing, and hopefully gets better soon.",

Although there are reported use of medicines from different countries (without proper confirmation); there is no confirmed medicines used to cure this virus, or no vaccine available for COVID-19 as of March 23, 2020 . Thus, the only way to stop the spread is to isolate us from social gathering or masses, and isolate confirmed people for quarantine. This process needs a combination of strong governance, use of existing and next technologies in innovative ways, and strong community participation and solidarity. Anderson et al. [3] made interesting analysis on how the country-based mitigation measures influence the course of epidemic (while they wrote the paper, the COVID-19 status was not a pandemic). While acknowledging that governance, citizen participation/awareness, penetration of technology varies from country to country, this paper makes a modest effort to analyze the experiences of China, Japan and Korea as East Asian cluster. Time series analysis of the key governance decision is made and its correlation with the spread of the virus within these three countries are observed. A few common lessons are drawn, which have larger implications to the society in this critical phase of COVID-19 global pandemic.",

In this section, a few global measures (mainly excluding East Asia, which will be described later), especially the role of WHO is narrated. Within two weeks from the first report in WHO Beijing office, first overseas case was reported in Thailand on 13th of January 2020. WHO Director General met Chinese President on 28th January and declared it as PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern) on 30th January. On the following day, Italy declared a national emergency with two case reported there. The virus spread continued in China as well as overseas after that, and on 11th February WHO has named the virus as COVID-19. A United Nations CMT (Crisis Management Team) was formed with WHO as the coordinating agency. WHO has appointed a few prominent persons as their COVID envoy on 21st of February to provide advices to different countries. A series of missions were organized by WHO team: one in Italy (24th February), one joint mission in China (25th February), and one in Iran (2nd March). 24th February was the time when the global epicenter has started shifting from China to other countries, with number of affected people outside China crossing that within China. Two major clusters were observed, apart from Kore and Japan: one in Iran and the other in Europe (northern Italy). Early March showed steady growth of affected people globally. WHO declared its research road map on 6th of March, and on 7th of March, it was found that the virus has affected 100 countries, and more than 100,000 people. This prompted WHO to declare COVID-19 as a global pandemic on 11th of March, and USA declared national emergency on 13th of March.

However, one month has changed the scenario, where Western Europe complex has become the new epicenter, and America has observed a significant propagation. Based on the simulation, Mckinsey [6] proposed three global scenarios of quick recovery, global slowdown and global pandemic and recession. This would affect differentially the second and third quarter of the year. While the base scenario talks on the control of spread in East Asia in Europe in early second quarter, the early recovery predicts that it would be in late first quarter, while the recession/pandemic scenario talks about middle to late second quarter. Fig. 2b shows the same on daily increase in these three countries. In both of Figures, since the numbers in China exceeds that in Korea and Japan by a significant percentage, the values are provided to show the highest numbers in China. China sees a sharp increase in number of confirmed cases from the third week of January, while a sharp increase in both recovered and death from the first week of February. Korea saw a sharp increase in number of cases from third week of February, while Japan saw an increase in the first week of March.",

This was a key turning point to identify new cases of affected people. A sharp increase in the number is also observed as a result of policy decision taken in Cluster 1 and 2 (Fig. 3) . To stop spread of the disease, it was important to identify all possible sources. Thus, the strict decisions taken in cluster 1 and 2 were crucial. QR code was introduced for all residents on February 18, and this was a good check to distinguish between the affected and non-affected people. The next couple of weeks were devoted to implement the policy decisions and be vigilant for its violation. In case of Taiwan, the time series analysis points out an early preparation. As early as 31st of December 2019, Taiwan announced medical advisory (14 days self-vigilance, wearing mask, temperature check etc.) to inbound visitors on the Wuhan and started medical test. Specific warning was issues to all in-bound people from Wuhan on 6th of January, and was repeated four times (10th, 11th and 17th January). A team of experts was dispatched to Wuhan on 6th of January to identify the new disease spread. There was an early warning issued on restraining and legal actions on fake news spread, which was also repeated several times (11th, 17th, 21st and 23rd January). First confirmed case was reported on 21st January in Taiwan, which also prompted some other key decisions. To protect panic buying, the government bought masks, and started its own distribution system through national insurance card. Number of masks entitled per insurance card was strictly monitored, and masks were distributed free of charge in the rural areas. This system started at the early stage (3rd of February), and system was developed and customized based on the need and supply of masks, and finally the online shopping system started on 12th of March.",

At that time, there were 3711 individuals, which includes 1045 crew members. Although there was an initial delay in testing, Disaster infection Control Team (DICT) under the Japanese Society for Infection Prevention and Control started conducted test in the ship along with DMAT (Disaster Medical Assistance Team) [9] . DICT team comprised of approved infection control doctors, approved infection management nurses, as well as experts from university hospitals and other institutions. The crew members were provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) and instructed on appropriate IPC (Infection Prevention and Control) practices. The passengers were given thermometers and asked to record their body temperatures. Those passengers with lab-confirmed COVID- 19 were disembarked and transferred to an isolation ward at healthcare facilities [10] . There was a zoning planned in the ship for the infected areas, as well as to store the infection prevention gears. With regards to the passengers, guidance was given through the in-cruise announcement repeatedly, and the video on the appropriate ways to remove masks and to sanitize fingers, created by the DICT, was delivered to the smart phones provided to each passenger for public awareness.

However, from 15th of February, there have been reports of transmission cases for which routes could not be identified. In such situation, the focus shifted from Boarder control to infection spread control phase [11] . As of February 20, three deaths have been reported, and severe cases have started to be reported in the elderly and patients with underlying diseases. As per the experts, during the epidemic phase, the treatment of the serious patients was required. Border control measures continued with quarantine restrictions on travel of passengers from China and Korea on 5th of March, which gradually extended to other high-risk countries also. Once the disease started spreading, it was essential to identify the clusters from where it started spreading, which is stated below.",

The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditionsto avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person. Second, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centers to prevent the transmission of the disease. Third, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes.

This delineation of roles and responsibilities between the responsible agency (KCDC) and the coordination agency (MoIS) made it possible for the KCDC and the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MoHW) to focus on epidemiological investigations and responses to the infectious disease. This effective response system was developed based on the double-loop learning process during the MERS experience in 2015, the novel swineorigin influenza A(H1N1) in 2009, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Consequently, the successful COVID-19 response can be directly attributed to the leadership of the President to accurately understand the fluctuating situation and emerging risk factors, and make accurate decisions based on the advice of expert groups, and the dedication of the Prime Minister who stayed in the Daegu and Gyeongbuk regions for three weeks to concentrate the capabilities of all ministries to cope with the crisis situation.",

In Korea, the 'Walk-Thru Test Booth' and 'Open Walk-Thru Booth' evolved from the drive-through screening method. For this method, a potential patient enters a booth, and then a medical staff securely outside the booth checks their condition verbally via an intercom and take on-the-spot samples from patients outside the booth by using a stethoscope. This method takes only 6-7 min per person and results in a much smaller chance of contagion thanks to a complete separation between patient and doctor.

In particular, more than 3000 people applied to volunteer as a nurse, and Korea was able to find hidden heroes such as nurse Kim who gave up her immigration to the United States in the process of applying for this volunteer service, or nurse Oh who sent a sincere letter saying, \"If I am not selected as a volunteer, I would suffer the fact that I can't help others in trouble. [31] \". They stayed in Daegu and Gyeongbuk for more than a month, devoting themselves to the treatment and prevention of the infection. Additionally, the president of a hotel in Changwon City provided hotel rooms free-of-charge for the volunteering medical doctors and nurses who had a hard time finding adequate accommodations. Efforts were also made to overcome COVID-19 on the basis of community consciousness, such as donations from all around the country.",

For example, more than 5000 stores in Dongdaemun Market, Gwangjang Market, and Tongin Market in Seoul City participated in the 'good landlord' campaign and cut the rent by 20-30%. In addition, a variety of \"Good Landlord Movements\", such as the exemption of franchise commissions from the food brand Chaeseondang, and a subsidy of 1 million Korean won for affiliates of mega coffees, gave hope to the small-business owners facing difficulties.",

Some of the recommendations are as follow: recommendations concern knowledge and science provision in understanding disaster and health-related emergency risks, the extension of disaster risk governance to manage both disaster risks and potential health-emergencies, particularly for humanitarian coordination aspects; and the strengthening of community-level preparedness and response. A proper risk assessment is required taking into consideration of health risk, exposures, behaviors and policy framework.",
