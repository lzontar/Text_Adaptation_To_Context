Severity of the illness ranges from asymptomatic to severe with a fatality rate of at least 2.3%. 1 As this pandemic causes strain on global health-care, there has been an urgent need to establish standard therapies to improve outcomes. Moreover, there is no known effective prophylactic therapy against COVID-19 and so far, there are no medications that have undergone large clinical trials that demonstrate improved outcomes against SARS-CoV-2. 1 Currently, there are only recommendations against further spread through proper hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, self-quarantine and person protective equipment [PPE] for health-care workers. 2 Vaccination using BCG against COVID-19 has been proposed, however human trials are still being conducted and limited data is available on their efficacy, safety and when they will be available to the general public. 3 Given the current pandemic of COVID-19, there has been proposed use of available medications to improve outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2. We present a review of proposed therapies for COVID-19, their mechanisms of action and their efficacy. with the spike protein being used for the viral entry into host cells by attaching onto angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]. 5, 6 Once bound, SARS-CoV-2 gains access to the cytosol of the host cell by cleavage of the S protein by TMPRRS2. 4, 6 Within the cytosol, SARS-CoV-2 begins the synthesis of replicase and other nonstructural proteins. Once this is complete, it begins the synthesis of its structural proteins through the use of its own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. 4, 6 After assembly of the virus, it exits the cell and begins the process again. Although the exact pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is poorly understood, one proponent of its pathogenesis is that it induces proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, TNF \u03b1, IL-1B and GCSF which can lead to a cytokine storm and subsequent endothelial damage. 7 Understanding the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 can help researchers hypothesize potential medications agents that prevent the viral entry, protein synthesis and replication cycle [ Table 1 ].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 218, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 411, "end": 412, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 588, "end": 589, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 937, "end": 938, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1728, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1730, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1842, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1844, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2075, "end": 2077, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2079, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2425, "end": 2426, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2611, "end": 2618, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| BACKGROUND"}, {"text": "Beginning with viral entry via the S-protein and ACE2 receptor, Umifenovir [Arbidol] targets the S-protein/ACE2 interaction which prevents viral entry into cells.

Camostat mesylate is another agent being investigated to inhibit viral entry, as it inhibits TMPRSS2 which facilitates viral entry into the host cell. 9 Although in vitro, this medication inhibits viral entry into cells, human trials are still pending. 9 Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine are anti-malarial drugs are being studied as potential drugs of choice for SARS-CoV-2.

Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, this enzyme is used to acidify the urine and transport bicarbonate back to the body under normal conditions. 25 Inhibiting this enzyme leads to diuresis which will increase urinary bicarbonate and decreases blood pH, this will cause hyperventilation to increase oxygen levels and decrease carbon dioxide in order to compensate the decrease in blood pH. 26 Although this will help a patient with HAPE; decreasing blood volume through diuresis and decreasing blood pH would not be ideal for a patient with SARS-CoV-2. 26 Moreover, acetazolamide is contraindicated in patients with poor renal function, which is seen in patients with SARS-CoV-2. 26, 27 Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, works in a similar manner as it lowers blood pressure; although effective in HAPE, 24 this would not be ideal for someone with SARS-CoV-2 as it would alter their ventilation/perfusion ratio and lower their oxygenation. 28 3 | CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic that is creating a health-care crisis and economic strain worldwide.

One of the proposed mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is the development of a cytokine storm, mainly through IL-6, IFN and TNF\u03b1. 6 Inhibiting one or several of these cytokines would help in reducing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and could potentially decrease mortality of the patient. Current studies are encouraging with limited trials showing a decrease in patient hospital stay, an increase in respiratory function and a decrease in mortality. 22,23 So far, studies on Tocilizumab and Remdesivir have been most promising in therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Drugs such as acetazolamide and nifedipine; which are used to treat high altitude pulmonary edema [HAPE], have been proposed as treatments for SARS-CoV-2 as they both develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "In a systematic review by Sarma et al hydroxychloroquine showed no difference in cure [OR 2.37, 0.13-44.53], worsening of disease [OR 1.37, 1.37-21.97] or safety concerns [OR 2.19, 0.59-8.18]11 when compared to conventional treatment. Also, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have adverse effects such prolonged QT interval, hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy; although well tolerated in healthy individuals, these side effects can be more prominent in critical ill patients.12", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors have no competing interest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST"}, {"text": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8547-2693Shadi Rezai https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8498-565X", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Richard A.
