Amiodarone is a widely available, low-cost antiarrhythmic drug that in the past has been considered as a possible antiviral medication [6] . Amiodarone and its main metabolite (mono-N-desethyl amiodarone) were shown to inhibit the entry of filoviruses (a family of single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus that includes Ebola virus) at the same serum concentration found in patients treated for arrhythmias [7, 8] . Amiodarone also proved able to block the spreading of SARS-CoV-1 infection in cell cultures without modifying the density of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors on the cell surface or interfering with the attachment of SARS-CoV-1 to the cells [9] . Interestingly, amiodarone displayed antiviral activity even when SARS-CoV-1 delivered its genome directly into the cytoplasm bypassing the endocytic compartment [9] .

Notably, amiodarone toxicity is mainly cumulative and dose-dependent, which means that the risk of AEs is directly related to the duration of the treatment [10] .
