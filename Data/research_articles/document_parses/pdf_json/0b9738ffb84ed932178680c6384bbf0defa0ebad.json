Bariatric surgery is established as an effective treatment for this condition. Objective: To assess the safety and effectiveness of different ventilation strategies in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Methods: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials aimed at evaluating ventilation strategies for obese patients was carried out. Primary outcomes: in-hospital mortality, adequacy of gas exchange, and respiration mechanics alterations. Results: Fourteen clinical trials with 574 participants were included. When recruitment maneuvers (RM) vs Positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) were compared, RM resulted in better oxygenation p = 0.03 (MD 79.93), higher plateau pressure p < 0.00001 (MD 7.30), higher mean airway pressure p < 0.00001 (MD 6.61), and higher compliance p < 0.00001 (MD 21.00); when comparing RM + Zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) vs RM + PEEP 5 or 10 cmH2O, RM associated with PEEP led to better oxygenation p = 0.001 (MD 167.00); when comparing Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) 40 cmH2O + PEEP 10 cmH2O vs CPAP 40 cmH2O + PEEP 15 cmH2O, CPAP 40 + PEEP 15 achieved better gas exchange p = 0.003 (MD 36.00) and compliance p = 0.0003 (MD 3.00). Conclusion: There is some evidence that the alveolar recruitment maneuvers associated with PEEP lead to better oxygenation and higher compliance.
