On the basis of two highly conserved peptide motifs, we have identified a new member of this family by PCR amplification and cDNA-library screening. The longest ORF encodes a protein of 930 residues. It contains the HEXXH(X)18E Zn-binding motif and displays high homology to the other M1 family members except for its N-terminus for which a signal sequence of 20 residues can be predicted. This interpretation was supported by expressing fusion proteins formed with green fluorescent protein which localized to intracellular vesicles in COS-7 and BHK cells. Northern-blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a major 3.1-kb transcript. For enzymatic studies, the complete protein was expressed in Sf 9 insect cells. When aminoacyl b-naphthylamides were used as substrates, efficient hydrolysis was only observed for Leu (and to a lesser extent Met). The activity was inhibited by chelators of bivalent cations and by other known aminopeptidase inhibitors, but surprisingly puromycin was without effect. This newly identified puromycin-insensitive leucyl-specific aminopeptidase is a signal-sequence-bearing member of family M1 and may be another example of the small subset of substrate-specific peptidases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Aminopeptidases are exopeptidases that catalyze the hydrolysis of amino-acid residues from the N-terminus of peptide or protein substrates. They are widely distributed throughout the animal and plant kingdoms and are found in subcellular organelles, in the cytoplasm, and as membrane components. These enzymes are involved in a variety of physiologically important processes such as protein processing and turnover, regulation of peptide hormone action, viral infection, tissue invasion, and cell cycle control [1] . Many of the aminopeptidases known are metalloenzymes containing a central Zn 21 ion, which is crucial for enzymatic activity. According to the structurally based classification of proteolytic enzymes suggested by Rawlings and Barrett [2], the majority of these enzymes belong to clan MA, family M1 of Zn-dependent exopeptidases (reviewed in [3] ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 511, "end": 514, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 858, "end": 861, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The most prominent member within the group of mammalian enzymes of family M1 is aminopeptidase N, one of the major proteins of the microvillar membrane of the small intestinal and kidney epithelial cells (reviewed in [4] ). Aminopeptidase N displays a broad substrate spectrum and hydrolyzes neutral N-termini. In brain, it may participate in the inactivation of enkephalins and other neuropeptides. On hematopoietic cells, it has been identified as the cell-surface differentiation antigen CD13. Interestingly, certain viruses (e.g. coronavirus 229E) misuse aminopeptidase N as a receptor enabling host cell infection. Aminopeptidase A is highly homologous to aminopeptidase N but prefers acidic N-terminal residues. Like aminopeptidase N, it is concentrated on brush-border membranes and on certain hematopoietic cells. In brain, aminopeptidase A has been implicated in the metabolism of angiotensin II to angiotensin III (reviewed in [5] ). Two more membraneanchored mammalian M1 family members have been described; the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-degrading ectoenzyme (TRH-DE) seems to represent the rare case of a substrate-specific exopeptidase. It is the only ectoenzyme known that is capable of degrading TRH (pyroGlu-His-Pro-NH 2 ) by hydrolyzing the pyroGlu-His bond. Its hormonal regulation in the anterior pituitary indicates that it may function as a regulatory element for the control of TRH-stimulated thyrotropin and prolactin release, whereas in brain it may act as a terminator for neuronal TRH signals (reviewed in [6] ). The insulin-regulated membrane aminopeptidase from rat adipocytes is also known as human placental leucine aminopeptidase/ oxytocinase. Although its physiological function is unclear, its insulin-induced redistribution from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane argues for a specific role in peptide hormone processing (reviewed in [7] ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 220, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 937, "end": 940, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1545, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1889, "end": 1892, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Besides these four type-II ectoenzymes, three cytoplasmic M1 members have been characterized.

All members of family M1 of Zn-dependent aminopeptidases share two well-conserved peptide motifs of six to seven residues. To characterize additional members (e.g. aminopeptidase W) that might belong to this family, completely degenerated oligonucleotides were deduced and used to amplify the respective cDNA fragments from rat pituitary. Among the products obtained was one fragment that was highly homologous but did not match perfectly to any of the known aminopeptidases. Using this PCR product as a probe, we isolated three independent clones from a rat pineal-gland cDNA library. The largest (no. 20) contained a cDNA insert of 5 kb; the others (nos 6 and 11) had inserts of 2.9 and 2.7 kb, respectively (Fig. 1A) . Despite the differences in total size, clones 11 and 20 had the same 5 H -terminal sequences (except for three more nucleotides in clone 20) and identical 3 H ends [except for a longer poly(A) tail in clone 11]. Clone 6 was identical with clone 11 except for the first 257 nucleotides, which were missing. Clones 20 and 11 were sequenced completely. The sequences were identical except for an inserted fragment of 2.1 kb in clone 20 starting at nucleotide 2697.

Interestingly, the sequences of both the 5 H end of this intron and the 5 H end of the following exon are very similar, and the first 10 nucleotides display 80% identity (consensus: GTAAARGGRT).

A network-based analysis employing the signal prediction server SignalP V1.1 (http://genome.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/index.html) predicts this stretch to represent an N-terminal signal sequence ( Fig. 2A) .

The cDNA clones isolated seem to represent the major and a minor incompletely/alternatively spliced transcript of a new member of family M1 of Zn-dependent metallopeptidases (PILS-AP). Its mRNA is easily detected in all rat tissues and cell lines analyzed so far, indicating ubiquitous expression. Moreover, expressed sequence tags from mouse and man can be assigned to represent PILS-AP orthologs by displaying a high degree of sequence conservation. In man, these sequences have been derived from various cDNA sources (heart, pancreas, fat, ovary, testis, etc.), thus corroborating its widespread distribution. The primary sequence of PILS-AP, as predicted from the major transcript, contains all of the known functionally important residues shared by the members of family M1 of Zn-dependent aminopeptidases. Besides these homologies, important differences in substrate specificity, the subcellular localization and enzyme chemical characteristics are evident, indicating that PILS-AP is not aminopeptidase W, but an as yet uncharacterized enzyme. PILS-AP does not accept basic or acidic substrates like aminopeptidase A, aminopeptidase B or leukotriene-A4 hydrolase. The other M1 members, i.e. insulinregulated aminopeptidase (placental leucine aminopeptidase/ oxytocinase), aminopeptidase N and PSA, prefer neutral and/or hydrophobic residues. This preference partially overlaps with the spectrum of PILS-AP, but its limited substrate range, i.e. Leu-b-naphthylamide and Met-b-naphthylamide as the sole aminoacyl-b-naphthylamide derivatives accepted, clearly distinguishes it from these aminopeptidases, which also hydrolyze chemically similar residues such as Val-b-naphthylamide or Ile-b-naphthylamide to a comparable degree. Another striking difference from PSA is the insensitivity of PILS-AP to puromycin, a substance that in our expression system, i.e. Sf 9 cells, was able to inhibit the endogenous insect Leu-cleaving activities almost completely. Recently the purification of a neuron-specific Leu-cleaving aminopeptidase from rat brain has been described [32] . Although the substrate specificity is very similar (Leu and Met derivatives as the preferred substrates), the clear difference in sensitivity towards puromycin again allows unequivocal discrimination. Another well-characterized Leu-preferring aminopeptidase is the ubiquitously expressed cytosolic leucine aminopeptidase, which has been best characterized from bovine lens [33] . It is a soluble hexameric Zn-dependent enzyme composed of identical subunits of 54 kDa each in its native form. Several leucine aminopeptidases from various organisms have been characterized and collectively constitute clan MF, family M17 of cocatalytic leucyl-metallopeptidases [34] . Again, these enzymes differ from PILS-AP by sequence and by the relaxed substrate specificity hydrolyzing Leu-b-naphthylamide and most N-terminal amino acids with comparable rates [35] . Moreover, the identity of mammalian leucine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1) with proline aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.5) has been demonstrated [36] . In addition, the K m for Leu-bnaphthylamide hydrolysis by leucine aminopeptidase is substantially higher (250 mm vs. 65 mm for PILS-AP) and leucine aminopeptidase is clearly more sensitive to l-leucinethiol and to the naturally occurring inhibitors bestatin and amastatin. With respect to the metal-chelating inhibitors, PILS-AP could be effectively inhibited by 1,10 phenanthroline and EDTA. This was expected in analogy with the other M1 members, but interestingly the effect of EDTA became maximal only after prolonged preincubation periods, which is generally not the case for the other metallopeptidases. The observed kinetics of inhibition of PILS-AP with EDTA is very reminiscent of the EDTA effects on TRH-DE, the only M1 family member with high substrate specificity that is known to have a highly conserved structure [21] and to bind Zn 21 very tightly [37] . An even more pronounced time-dependence was observed for astacin, a small metallopeptidase from crayfish, for which a 200-h preincubation period was necessary to obtain 50% inhibition [38] . Taken together, the substrate spectrum of PILS-AP is strikingly limited, and the sensitivity towards various inhibitors is consistent with a Zn-dependent enzyme which binds the metal ion tightly. The deduced primary structure predicts a cleavable signal peptide for the N-terminus. This feature is unique among the currently known mammalian M1 family members. Aminopeptidase A, aminopeptidase N, insulinregulated aminopeptidase and TRH-DE contain N-terminal domains of 23\u00b125 consecutive hydrophobic residues which anchor these peptidases as type-II ectoenzymes. In contrast, PSA is a cytosolic enzyme which may functionally interact with proteasomes [11] . Although it has been found partially associated with membrane, this interaction is clearly different from integral membrane proteins, and the active site was localized within the cytosol [39] . Aminopeptidase B and the closely related leukotriene-A4 hydrolase are soluble enzymes which can be found as secreted aminopeptidases, although no classical signal peptide can be predicted in the primary sequences. With respect to PILS-AP, our analysis of the subcellular localization of the EGFP-fusion proteins in mammalian cells argues in favor of the functionality of its signal peptide. The nature of the vesicles to which the enzyme was targeted and the possibility of regulated secretion remain crucial questions to be addressed in the future. Given the high homology to the other M1 members and the widespread expression of PILS-AP, the narrow substrate specificity is a rather atypical feature among the known peptidases [40] , and it is increasingly puzzling that nature developed such a multitude of peptidases which are all capable of cleaving N-terminal Leu residues.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2208, "end": 2212, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2588, "end": 2592, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2874, "end": 2878, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3061, "end": 3065, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3205, "end": 3209, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 4039, "end": 4043, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 4075, "end": 4079, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 4266, "end": 4270, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 4923, "end": 4927, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 5117, "end": 5121, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 5853, "end": 5857, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "D I S C U S S I O N"}, {"text": "We thank Birgit Ku \u00c8hlein, Anke Rosebrock and Uwe Grunenberg for expert technical assistance, Ralf Sigmund for valuable help with computer-based analysis, Anne Po \u00c8tter for help with the insect cell culture, Rudi Bauerfeind and Beate Sodeik for experienced support with fluorescence microscopy, Stefan Turwitt, Theofilos Papadopoulos, Roland Rabeler, Daniel Brauer and Silke Tillmanns for stimulating discussions, and Valerie Ashe for linguistic help.
