Healthcare environments play an important role in the transmission of HAIs. The Probiotic Cleaning Hygiene System (PCHS) has been shown to decrease hospital surface pathogens up to 90% vs. conventional chemical cleaning (CCC). This study compares PCHS to CCC as to reduction of HAIs and their severity, related antibiotic resistances, and costs. Incidence rates of HAIs/antibiotic resistances were estimated from a previously conducted multicenter pre-post (6 months CCC + 6 months PCHS) intervention study, after applying the propensity score matching technique. A budget impact analysis compared the current scenario of use of CCC with future scenarios considering increasing utilization of PCHS, from 5% to 50% in the next five years, from a hospital perspective in Italy. The cumulative incidence of HAI was 4.6% and 2.4% (p < 0.0001) for CCC (N = 4160) and PCHS (N = 4160) (OR = 0.47, CI 95% 0.37-0.60), with severe HAIs of 1.57% vs. 1% and antibiotic resistances of 1.13% vs. 0.53%, respectively. Increased use of PCHS over CCC in Italian internal medicine/geriatrics and neurology departments in the next 5 years is expected to avert at least about 31,000 HAIs and 8500 antibiotic resistances, and save at least 14 million euros, of which 11.6 for the treatment of resistant HAIs.

Regarding the antibiotic use in hospitals, the indicators set a reduction in systemic antibiotic use greater than 5% and a reduction of fluroquinolones greater than 10% in 2020 compared to 2016.

In fact, PCHS use was associated with a reduction of HAI incidence of 48% and, among total HAIs, the drug-resistant HAIs were reduced by 53% compared with the use of conventional cleaning protocols. Moreover, the PCHS showed a reduction of about 67% of severe HAIs (from 1.57% to 1%). Therefore, the PCHS would allow savings from the Italian hospital perspective of about 14 million euros in 5 years, of which 11.6 related to the pharmacological treatment of drug-resistances.
