So far, it is not known how shedding of viral RNA correlates with shedding of infectious virus. Second, the standard treatment included antiviral treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon-\u03b1, and general supportive treatment. Since nearly all the patients were given this standard treatment, we were not able to judge if these treatments had effect on viral RNA shedding.
