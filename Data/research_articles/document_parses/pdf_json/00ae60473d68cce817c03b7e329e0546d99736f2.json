Hence, there is an important role for antiviral therapy in the management of influenza. While amantadine and rimantadine have been available for the treatment of influenza in some countries for several years, they are only effective against influenza A viruses, they can have neurological and gastrointestinal adverse effects, and resistant virus is rapidly generated. Neuraminidase inhibitors, a new class of drug, are potent and specific inhibitors of all strains of influenza virus, and they have minimal adverse effects. The greatest benefit is seen in those patients presenting <30 hours after development of influenza symptoms, those with severe symptoms or those in high-risk groups. In addition to treatment of the infection, both drugs are effective prophylactically and have been shown to limit spread of infection in close communities, such as families and in nursing homes. No resistant virus strains have been isolated from normal individuals treated with zanamivir. Resistant virus can be isolated from approximately 1% of adults and 5% of paediatric patients with influenza treated with oseltamivir. However, infectivity of mutant viruses is generally compromised. Governments spend millions of dollars on influenza vaccination campaigns; however, once influenza virus is circulating in the community, vaccination cannot limit the spread of disease. A greater promotion of the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment and prevention of influenza could have a significant impact on limiting its spread. This could result in saving millions of dollars, not only in direct costs associated with medical and hospital care, but also significant savings in indirect costs associated with the loss of productivity at work, school and home environments. For the benefit of all communities, there needs to be a greater awareness of the symptoms of influenza and the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in disease treatment.",

Hence, these mutations may have no effect on drug sensitivity in humans. Since the cells used in the laboratory have different types of receptors compared with human respiratory cells, there is currently no suitable cell for assessing the role of hemagglutinin in the development of resistance in human clinical isolates. One group is attempting to make an MDCK cell which has a higher density of human like sialic acids; [65] however, this has not yet been tested with a panel of known resistant hemagglutinin mutants.",

To date, this is the only accepted method of determining drug resistance in clinical isolates. Neuraminidase mutations can render the enzyme from 10-to 10 000-fold less sensitive to the inhibitors. Mutations in neuraminidase can be both drug and virus neuraminidase subtype specific. [60] Both zanamivir and oseltamivir are based on the structure of a product of sialic acid generated during catalysis, 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA) [ figure  1 ]. However, zanamivir has only a single substitution of a guanidinium group at the 4\u2032 position on the sugar ring. Oseltamivir has several differences, since it contains a cyclohexene ring instead of the sugar ring, and has two substitutions on this ring. It has a substitution of an amino group at the 4\u2032 position and a large pentyl ether group replacing the glycerol side chain at the 6\u2032 position. Binding of oseltamivir requires the movement of amino acids in the active site of neuraminidase to accommodate the larger side chain, whereas zanamivir does not. Because of the differences related as possible to the natural ligands of the target. This means in their chemical structures, there are specific mutations that affect that the greater the difference between the inhibitor and the natural the binding to each of the inhibitors. For example, mutations substrate, the greater the possibility that mutations can arise that preventing the movement of the amino acids in the active site affect binding of the inhibitor without affecting binding of the confer a higher level of resistance to oseltamivir, whereas those that affect the interaction with the guanidinium group confer natural substrate.
