He bought antiemetic at the pharmacy, and his vomiting symptoms eased slightly after taking the antiemetic. One day before admission, he had a fever with a temperature of 38.0 \u00b0C. He has no history of exposure to Wuhan, but his nephew had a history of exposure to Wuhan. On admission, his chest CT showed pneumonia in the bilateral lungs and ground-glass opacities in the right lung. We suspected that he was infected with SARS-CoV-2. A pharyngeal swab sample and stool sample were collected. On admission, the count of total T lymphocyte decreased and IL-6 slightly increased.",

He was given antiviral therapy, including \u03b1-interferon atomization inhalation (5 million U per time, Bid), oral lopinavir/ritonavir (2 capsules each time, Bid) and ribavirin 500 mg (intravenous infusion, Bid). Xuebijing (100 ml, Bid) and Chinese herb were also used. After treatments, his body temperature of patient was normal, and his vomiting gradually disappeared.

            "text": "It has been proven that SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a viral receptor to enter the target cell [5] . Except for the respiratory system, ACE2 receptors are highly abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia [6] . Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor that is abundantly expressed in gastrointestinal system as a possible reason for gastrointestinal infection [7] . ACE2 is considered as an important regulator of intestinal inflammation, which may be the potential mechanism by which diarrhea in COVID-19 is caused. After viral entry, virus-specific RNA and proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm to assemble new virions, which can be released to the gastrointestinal tract [1] . Isolated infectious SARS-CoV-2 from stool indicates the possible fecal-oral transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 [1] . SARS-CoV RNA was found in the sewage water of two hospitals in Beijing treating patients with SARS [8] . Therefore, fecal-oral transmission may be another route for SARS-CoV-2 spread. Prevention of fecal-oral transmission should be taken into consideration to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV2 RNA is detectable in stool samples, confirmation of viability from viral culture is lacking. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 is breaking out in the worldwide. Patients initially presented with only vomiting are easily misdiagnosed or missed. Therefore, the gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 should be paid attention to. In China, rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from stool is performed routinely in patients and is used as guidance for the disposition of patients with COVID-19.",
