Thus, social media comes with its own limitations for misinformation in the form of rumours or fake news (Zubiaga, Liakata, Procter, Wong Sak Hoi, & Tolmie, 2016) . Moreover, once rumors begin to spread on social media, they are very difficult to control with updates or corrections (Jones, Thompson, Dunkel Schetter, & Silver, 2017) . Among these, health rumors which are unverified information regarding the practice of medicine and healthcare, often endanger public health (Oh & Lee, 2019) . Hence, it is important to understand the role and impact of social media in spreading rumours and verify information before sharing it with others.",

The available literature in Bangladesh and India suggests that media reporting about suicide includes information which offers details name of the victim, their occupation, method of suicide, images of suicide victims, suicide notes and citations form suicide notes. This is the information which works to make the news attractive and shares details which increase access to information for harming self and may also work to create misinformation or rumors (Arafat, Mali & Akter, 2020; Armstrong et al., 2018; Jain and Kumar, 2016) . However, the media does not highlight information to educate the general population about what are early signs of suicidal behaviors, prevention plans and expert opinions from mental health professionals, helpline numbers for support and availability of emergency services in hospitals. These findings further suggest that the reports in media on suicide do not follow the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health regulatory bodies on reporting of suicide in media (Arafat, Mali & Akter, 2020; Armstrong et al., 2018; Cherian, Lukose, Rappaia et al., 2020; Jain and Kumar, 2016) .

            "text": "hour news cycle. The individual's anxiety levels or anxious personality traits makes them to spend more time online to look for information. Many reports show that there is an increase in online social media activity because of constant connectivity with the national and world news and as well as with presence of anxiety traits i.e. people with a high level of health anxiety spend more time searching online for health information than those with a lower level of health anxiety(Muse,   McManus, Leung, Meghrebilan, & Williams, 2012). Unverified information or rumors on social media and anxiety go hand in hand as anxious individuals or the people who are at risk of developing anxiety or for those for whom it serves as a medium to ventilate their affective state are the individuals who are more likely to share these kinds of information with others without verifying the source(Anthony, 1973; Pezzo & Beckstead, 2006). These behaviors lead to exponential spreading of fake news which may result in more time being spent online on nonproductive social interactions and on transitory alleviation of anxiety. The research literature suggests that around 20% of older adolescents and young adults are engaging in excessive use of technology like problematic use of social media and online gaming. In addition, they experience symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress which play a role as well in making them spend increased time online to alleviate these psychological symptoms momentarily. The spending of increased time online leads to excessive use of technology and it increases the risk of exposure to and spread of unverified information or rumors on digital platforms",
