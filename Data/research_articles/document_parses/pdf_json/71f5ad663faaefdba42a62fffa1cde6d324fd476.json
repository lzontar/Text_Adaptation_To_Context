            "text": "Innate immune responses are needed to initiate protective adaptive immunity. The early innate immune response plays a key role in determining the magnitude, quality, and duration of the adaptive immune responses. Very highly purified antigens make poor vaccines because they lack the signals that trigger innate immune responses and as a result cannot generate the downstream signaling required to enhance adaptive responses. Conversely, modified live vaccines, when mimicking natural infections, cause cell damage, trigger the release of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and promote strong innate and adaptive responses. In effect therefore, adjuvants trigger the mandatory innate response needed to optimize the adaptive responses and promote the uptake of vaccine antigens by antigen-presenting cells-essentially dendritic cells ( Fig. 7 .1). They do this in two ways. First, they trigger innate immune responses that provide a stimulus for dendritic cell function and antigen presentation. Alternatively (or additionally) they deliver the antigen in a form optimized for dendritic cell processing and antigen presentation. Innate immune responses are triggered when pattern-recognition receptors detect microbial invasion and tissue damage. Molecules released by tissue damage (DAMPs) or molecules from foreign microbes (PAMPs) trigger innate responses through pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) (Fig. 7 .2). The activation of PRRs and other cellular receptors on dendritic cells triggers cytokine release. These cytokines promote helper T cell responses, while these in turn activate B and T cells and so promote adaptive immunity.",

            "text": "Some adjuvants cause cell and tissue damage and so provide the body with DAMPs. These DAMP-type adjuvants act by chemical irritation or have direct toxic effects. Thus adjuvants such as the saponins and some emulsions cause cell lysis at the injection site. Saponins are amphipathic soap-like glycosides that can form complexes with cell membrane cholesterol resulting in membrane destruction. The toxicity of emulsions is caused by the presence of short-chain detergentlike molecules that lyse cell membranes. Longer chains are less toxic but poorer adjuvants. The emulsifiers used in water/oil emulsions may have similar toxic effects. Aluminum salts are also cytotoxic and cause the release of DNA, uric acid, and adenosine from dying cells. All these adjuvants release DAMPs that bind to receptors on antigen presenting cells and activate their inflammasome pathway. This generates cytokines leading to helper T cell activation. (Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes whose activation stimulates the production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 and so promote both innate and adaptive immunity.) A second type of adjuvant contains microbial products, PAMPs, the essential \"danger\" signals that also trigger innate immune processes. These PAMP-type adjuvants also provide signals through pattern recognition receptors such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and so activate dendritic cells. PAMP-type adjuvants contain killed bacteria, or microbial molecules such as flagellin (a TLR5 ligand), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (a TLR 4/2 ligand), DNA containing CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (a TLR 9 ligand), their analogs such as monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA, a TLR4/2 ligand), or synthetic TLR ligands. They may contain bacterial toxins like cholera toxin (CT) or Escherichia coli labile toxin (LT). These PAMP-type adjuvants directly activate PRRs on dendritic cells and so cause the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). They also stimulate the production of neutrophil-attracting chemokines such as Many adjuvants contain components that engage both pathways by using a mixture of PAMPs and DAMPs. For example, TLR agonists synergize with cell-damaging squalene oilin-water emulsions to induce strong innate responses. This increases the release of the stimulatory cytokines and chemokines. These in turn recruit antigen-presenting cells to the injection site. They enhance antigen uptake as well as the activation and maturation of the antigen-presenting cells ( Fig. 7.3) .",

Until recently alum (aluminum potassium sulfate AlK(SO 4 ) 2 , was the only adjuvant globally licensed for human use. This has now generally been replaced by aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlO[OH], aluminum hydroxyphosphate (HAlO 5 P), or aluminum phosphate (Al [PO 4 ] 3 ). At a neutral pH the hydroxide binds to negatively charged proteins, whereas the phosphate binds positively charged proteins. These aluminum adjuvants either adsorb antigen to the salt nanoparticles or they can be coprecipitated with the antigen. Either method ensures that the antigen is tightly bound to the mineral matrix. It thus makes soluble antigens particulate so that they can be endocytosed and effectively processed. Calcium phosphate is also used as an adjuvant.

This releases DAMPs including DNA, uric acid, ATP, heat shock protein 70, and interleukins 1 and 33. These DAMPs then attract neutrophils with some eosinophils and lymphocytes. Alum causes dying neutrophils to release DNA to form extracellular traps and enhance dendritic cell T cell interactions. Recruitment of mature dendritic cells to the sites of injection is also enhanced. Subsequently macrophages are also attracted to these sites and these macrophages may then develop into dendritic cells. Alum appears to affect lipids in the plasma membrane and promotes dendritic cell homing to lymph nodes. Alum also stimulates the production of chemokines that attract neutrophils and eosinophils. Thus alum has multiple effects largely based on its tissue damaging properties. DNA is known to accumulate at sites of alum deposition and is apparently important because local DNase treatment blocks this adjuvant activity. It has been suggested that alum kills cells at the injection site, releasing DAMPs, which in turn activate host DCs. Recently it has also been demonstrated that alum signals through inflammasomes. DCs or macrophages stimulated with alum plus lipopolysaccharide induced IL-1b and IL-18 release.

The most abundant of these fractions is QS-21. QS-21 combines the most potent adjuvant activity with minimal toxicity.

            "text": "One method of forming a slow-release antigen depot is to incorporate the antigen in a waterin-oil emulsion (droplets of the aqueous phase plus a surfactant such as Tween, Span, or lecithin emulsified in an oil phase). A light mineral oil stimulates a local, chronic inflammatory response, and as a result, a granuloma or abscess forms around the site of the inoculum. The antigen is slowly leached from the aqueous phase of the emulsion. These emulsion adjuvants may cause significant tissue irritation and destruction. Mineral oils are especially irritating. Nonmineral oils, although less irritating, are also less-effective adjuvants. The tissue damage generates DAMPs that stimulate both dendritic cells and macrophages. Nanoemulsions are DAMP-type adjuvants consisting of oil-in-water emulsions containing both solvents and surfactants. An example of a nanoemulsion is MF59; an adjuvant used in human influenza vaccines. MF59 contains squalene combined with polysorbate 80 (Tween 80an emulsifier) and sorbitan trioleate (Span 85). Squalene is a linear hydrocarbon found in many animal tissues, most notably the liver of sharks. It is a free-flowing oil that can be readily metabolized and is nontoxic. These nanoemulsions do not form a depot at the injection site, but the oil droplets stimulate immune cell recruitment and the emulsifiers cause cell damage. It is more potent and consistent than aluminum-based vaccines and induces Th1 type cell-mediated responses. MF59 also induces a mild local inflammatory reaction. The slow release of antigen from the emulsion may promote macrophage differentiation into dendritic cells. Antigen bound to the oil droplets promotes enhanced uptake by dendritic cells at the injection site, possibly by stimulating local chemokine production. They may also trigger local release of TNFa and IL-1b. MF59 recruits neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and B cells to injection sites. This results in the increased transport of the antigen to draining lymph nodes. Interestingly none of the components of MF59 are adjuvants by themselves. By combining microarray and immunofluorescence assays it has been possible to compare the effects of MF59, and alum adjuvants. For example, MF59 induced the increased expression of 891 genes, whereas alum induced 312 genes. MF 59 was the most potent inducer of genes encoding cytokines, cytokine receptors, and adhesion molecules. MF59 has been used successfully to adjuvant a canine coronavirus vaccine.",

Carbopol promotes the capture of antigen by inflammatory macrophages. It may be combined with other DAMP-type adjuvants such as MF59 or a lipid/ polymer/saponin adjuvant to generate additive effects. Carbopol has also been used in equine influenza, porcine circovirus, and M. hyopneumoniae vaccines.",

            "text": "The immune system can trap and process particles such as bacteria or other microorganisms much more efficiently than soluble antigens. As a result, many successful adjuvants incorporate vaccine antigens into readily phagocytosable particles (Fig. 7.5) . These adjuvants include emulsions, microparticles, ISCOMs, and liposomes, and all are designed to deliver antigen efficiently to antigen-presenting cells. Liposomes are lipid-based synthetic nano-or microparticles 200-1000 nm in size constructed of amphipathic lipid molecules surrounding an inner aqueous core. They are biodegradable and nontoxic. Hydrophilic antigens are enclosed in the aqueous core whereas hydrophobic antigens are inserted in the lipid bilayer. The antigens are effectively trapped and processed, yet are also protected from rapid degradation. They have been used as adjuvants and delivery systems to encapsulate, protect, and enhance antigen uptake by antigenpresenting cells and have been used in influenza and hepatitis A vaccines. The cationic charge is essential for efficient antigen adsorption to the nanoparticle, for retention at the injection site, for activation of the dendritic cells, and for vaccine immunogenicity including the induction of Th1 All of these particulate adjuvants may be made more potent by incorporating PAMPs. Nanotechnology uses particles with an overall size range of 1 to 1000 nanometers. These nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, or nanofibers can be used as adjuvants to promote responses to vaccines. They mimic viruses and bacteria in terms of size and structure. They can also encapsulate and so protect antigens from premature degradation. Because of their very small size, they effectively deliver peptides or proteins to antigen processing cells. Particles less than 1mm in diameter are ingested by pinocytosis; particles less than 120 nm are ingested by endocytosis. Particles smaller than 500 nm can freely enter the lymphatic system and travel to draining lymph nodes, where they are taken up by the antigen processing cells, but not by other cell types. They can activate dendritic cells and stimulate antigen processing. Nanoparticles are also biocompatible, biodegradable, and easy to produce. It is important to remember that biological molecules involved in immunity, especially antigens, allergens, and PAMPS, are also nanometers in size so particle size is critical. Conventional aluminum adjuvants employ microparticles (2-8 mm) and promote Th2 responses. However, if they are reduced to nanoparticle size (200-1500 nm) they favor Th1 responses.",

Some of these biomaterials include nanoparticles and microparticles formed from polymers or lipids that can be conjugated or targeted to immune cells. They offer significant benefits by being able to control the loading and unloading of immune cargoes. Nanoparticles have unique immunological properties that can be manipulated by altering their size, shape, charge, and hydrophobicity. They can be engineered to display a mixture of antigens and costimulating molecules on their surface so that the immune response is optimized. They can be coated with unique combinations of antigens, cytokines, adhesion molecules, immunomodulators, and costimulatory ligands, and in effect may be specifically tailored to generate key protective processes. By associating antigens with PRRs, nanoparticles can trigger cytotoxic lymphocyte responses to antigens that normally won't do this.",

Typically, these combinations combine a DAMP adjuvant such as alum and the saponins, or a particulate carrier such as liposomes together with a PAMP such as MPLA, or CpG DNA. For example, an oil-based depot adjuvant can be mixed with killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. butyricum incorporated into the water-in-oil emulsion using Arlacel A as an emulsifier. The mixture is called Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). Not only does FCA form a depot, but the mycobacteria also contain muramyl dipeptide (N-acetylmuramyll-alanyl-d-isoglutamine), a PAMP that activates macrophages and dendritic cells. FCA works best when given subcutaneously or intradermally and when the antigen dose is relatively low. FCA promotes immunoglobulin (Ig)G production over IgM. It inhibits tolerance induction, favors delayed hypersensitivity reactions, accelerates graft rejection, and promotes resistance to tumors. FCA can be used to induce experimental autoimmune diseases, such as experimental allergic encephalitis and thyroiditis. It also stimulates macrophage activation, thus promoting their phagocytic and cytotoxic activities.",

Mucosal surfaces act as physical barriers to prevent invasion, and as a result also exclude vaccine antigens and adjuvants. However, there are specialized antigen-sampling cells on these surfaces including M cells and intraepithelial dendritic cells. M cells can take up antigen and then transfer it to antigen presenting cells. Some antigens may also be taken up by goblet cells. The mucosal epithelium expresses many innate immune receptors including TLRs. Thus PAMPs such as muramyl dipeptide, poly I:C, flagellin, and CpG oligonucleotides work on mucosal sites. Some bacterial PAMPs such cholera toxin and the heat labile enterotoxin of E. coli can also act as mucosal adjuvants by stimulating dendritic cells. Cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate induces both Th1 and Th17 responses on mucosal surfaces. DAMP adjuvants can also act on mucosa to induce cell stress or damage. These include cyclodextrin and some oleic acid derivatives. They may simply work by inducing sufficient inflammation and mild damage to permit antigen entry. Some compounds added to intranasal adjuvants may prolong their half-lives on mucosal surfaces. A pectin that forms a gel on mucosal surfaces will increase the antigenicity of intranasal influenza vaccine by increasing the time it remains in contact with the mucosa. Other complex carbohydrates such as pullulans and mannans may have a similar effect.",

They can be classified into damage-associated molecular patterns-type adjuvants that act by killing cells so that their released products trigger inflammation. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns-type adjuvants contain microbial molecules that trigger inflammation and dendritic cell maturation through pattern recognition receptors. A third type of adjuvant consists of nanoparticles or emulsions optimized to deliver antigen efficiently to dendritic cells or alternatively to prolong the release of antigen into the body. Different types of adjuvants may be combined to maximize their effect.Keywords: adjuvants, PAMPs, DAMPS, innate immunity, aluminum, emulsions, saponin, nanoparticles, liposomes, oils, polymers.",
