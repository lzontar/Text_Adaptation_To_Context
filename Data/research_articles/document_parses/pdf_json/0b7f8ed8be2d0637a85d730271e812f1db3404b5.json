Most notably from a healthcare perspective, all non-critical medical appointments in hospitals were postponed, and general practitioners (GPs) and private specialists were asked to see only patients with the utmost important needs. 1 The major focus of the healthcare system has been on morbidity and mortality of individuals with SARS-CoV- 19 infection, but an increasing number of reports of reduced volumes of patients with non-infectious disease have gradually emerged. 2, 3 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiovascular condition resulting in a hospital contact, 4, 5 and correct and timely treatment is important when managing this condition. 6 The consequences of a national lockdown have never been described and could pose accompanying collateral damage on top of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, we aim to estimate the incidence, patient characteristics, and related outcomes of new-onset AF during a period with a national lockdown.",

The lowest IRRs were found 3 weeks into the lockdown compared with the corresponding weeks (Figure 1) , suggesting a progression in the drop in new AF diagnoses. Patients diagnosed with new-onset AF during the lockdown were younger and with a lower CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score; hence, we speculate that patients with better physical resources had an increased chance of being diagnosed during a lockdown. Moreover, during the lockdown, the elderly in particular were encouraged to stay at home and refrain from social contact including routine visits to their GP, thus limiting the possibility of early AF detection as well. In contrast, history of cancer, heart failure, and vascular disease (ischaemic heart disease and peripheral artery disease) were more prevalent among the AF patients diagnosed during lockdown, suggesting that these patient categories could be subject to more surveillance and increasing chances of undergoing physical exam or ECG. The non-significant slight increase in all-cause death could be due to the higher comorbidity burden overall among newonset AF patients diagnosed during lockdown.",

The former is often discovered through opportunistic screening or a routine ECG in general practice, which has been proven highly effective to catch AF. 15 Both activities reduced following lockdown, hence fewer patients would be referred for further evaluation. In contrast, those with more severe symptoms would be expected to seek medical attention, although the threshold for both patients contacting a physician and the physician agreeing to a consultation is arguably higher during a crisis where it is advised to postpone all non-acute matters for both the patient's and the physician's safety. Our data suggest that diagnoses were less frequently registered in all scenarios of AF presentations, since occurrence of new-onset AF in hospitalized patients and outpatients declined equally.",

With an increased risk and fear of contracting COVID-19 during a hospitalization, the threshold and demand for admission were arguably higher for physicians and patients, respectively. 17 Interestingly, 12% of new-onset AF contacts were virtual during the lockdown as compared with 2% during the corresponding weeks ( Table 1) , suggesting a durable way of evaluating patients suspected of having AF when all physical contact should be minimized. For future health crisis management, telemedicine along with a targeted screening process should probably play a bigger role. The utilization of personal ECG devices as well as screening of high-risk individuals taking biomarkers and patient characteristics into account have proven effective in diagnosing AF. 18, 19 Thus to prepare for future situations like this, hospitals and GPs could look into implementing such procedures.",

Within the cardiovascular area, there have been reports of a decrease in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) volume at invasive centres, but descriptions of the most common condition, AF, are missing. 2, 3 Our data support a significant impact on registered AF diagnoses, and may indicate a large group of patients who are undiagnosed and not properly evaluated. The proportion of patients with ischaemic stroke or death in relation to new-onset AF was not significantly increased during the lockdown, but we express concerns of appropriate management of AF patients since the proportions seem to increase stepwise during the weeks of lockdown, despite these patients being younger and with lower CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores ( Table 1) . We did see a non-significant increase in all-cause death as well, which could be explained by the history of cancer, heart failure, and vascular disease being more prevalent among the patients diagnosed during the lockdown ( Table 1) . Related hospitalizations with heart failure and vascular disease were, however, comparable (Supplementary material online, Table S3 ).",

New-onset diagnosis of AF has a positive predictive value of 95%, 23 and it is reassuring that extending the comparison to the corresponding weeks in 2017 and 2018 showed the same decline (Supplementary material online, Table  S2 ). However, the diagnoses used have not been specifically validated during this epidemic. Some of the diagnoses in the registries may or may not have a different accuracy during a public health crisis, which should be kept in mind when evaluating the results. Furthermore, the registration of virtual outpatient contact was implemented in the beginning of 2019 and was available for all patient contacts registered during the lockdown in 2020 and corresponding weeks in 2019; however, the accuracy of this registration has not been validated. Information on redeemed prescriptions was only available until 31 January 2020, putting some limitations on our analysis. Our definition of hypertension, which is an important risk factor for AF and stroke, was based on prescription data. However, we did not find any difference of prevalence of hypertension; thus, we are confident that our definition captured long-standing hypertension. Additionally, we lacked information on subsequent prescriptions of oral anticoagulants (OACs) during the lockdown, making it hard to speculate on whether unregistered AF patients were diagnosed by GPs; diagnoses given outside of hospital contacts, such as at general practices, are not registered in our databases. Thus, patients diagnosed in general practice or any other healthcare contact outside the hospital system, who commenced relevant treatment and were referred to a department of cardiology, but then this was postponed by the cardiologist due to low risk and correct treatment, are not registered in our databases. This is a limitation, since these patients most probably account for some of the decline in the registration of new-onset AF, although we think it unlikely to have a major impact on the observed decline.",

However, this would draw our estimates towards the null hypothesis. 24 ",
