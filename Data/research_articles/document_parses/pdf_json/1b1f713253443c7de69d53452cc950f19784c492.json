Here we used a similar strategy to capture COVID-19 deaths that had not been attributed specifically to the pandemic coronavirus. Monitoring trends in broad mortality outcomes, like P&I or all-causes, provides a window into the magnitude of the mortality burden missed in official tallies of COVID-19 deaths. Given the lack of adequate testing and geographical variability in testing intensity, this type of monitoring provides key information on the severity of the epidemic in different geographic regions. It also provides some indication of the degree to which viral testing is missing deaths associated with COVID-19 directly or indirectly. Our findings suggest that the degree to which deaths due to COVID-19 are being correctly attributed to SARS-CoV-2 varies by state. Some states, such as Florida and Pennsylvania, might have missed deaths early on and might be undercounting deaths by a substantial degree currently. Other states, like Washington, have an accurate estimate of the mortality burden of the pandemic virus due to intense testing. And in states that have been hit hard by the pandemic virus, such as New Jersey or New York, the total excess mortality burden is 2-3 times that ascribed to COVID-19 in official statistics.
