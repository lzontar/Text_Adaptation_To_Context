Of 82 subjects, respiratory viruses were the most common pathogen identified in 27 (33%), followed by fungus and bacteria in 8 (10%) and 4 (5%) subjects, respectively. Among subjects with RVI, 11 (41%) required ICU admission and 16 (59%) required mechanical ventilation. The proportion of respiratory viruses identified, and the associated complicated hospital course highlights the significant role that RVIs play in the lung health of PLH.",

[5] [6] [7] The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of respiratory viruses in a cohort of PLH hospitalized with a respiratory complaint at a tertiary care center. Secondarily, commercial real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was compared to pathogen-agnostic next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the detection of viral pathogens in respiratory specimens.

However, in support of these findings, viruses were also the most commonly identified pathogen in community-acquired pneumonia in the EPIC study, which used rigorous microbiologic testing, suggesting that the prevalence of viruses identified in this study is not due to disparate diagnostic sensitivity. 12 We also cannot exclude that viruses identified could represent asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx; however, all subjects were symptomatic on admission, and with the exception of four subjects that had concomitant PCP or bacterial infection, no other respiratory pathogens were identified. Lastly, the use of NGS in this study was exploratory and limited to a subset of participants. The limit of detection by the number of reads being sequenced emerged as a constraint of NGS as seen previously. 13, 14 Likely for this reason, a coronavirus was identified by RT-PCR, but In conclusion, respiratory viruses were the most common respiratory pathogen identified in admitted PLH. These subjects experienced severe illness as 41% required ICU admission, 59% required mechanical ventilation, and 11% died. Respiratory viral infections represent an important cause of severe illness in PLH admitted with respiratory symptoms. Future research should be directed at understanding if PLH are at increased risk of respiratory viral infections or increased severity compared with HIV-uninfected individuals in the setting of widespread ART availability and in low prevalence HIV settings, and if so, potential mechanisms underlying that increased risk.",

            "text": "ratory virus were found to have increased BMI (29 vs 24, P = .04) compared with those without a respiratory virus. In addition to the fact that increased BMI is a known risk factors for complicated influenza infection in the general population, this suggests that interventions targeting weight loss could reduce risk among PLH.8 Similarly, current smoking was significantly more prevalent in those diagnosed with a respiratory virus compared to those without (63% vs 25%, P = .001). This mirrors the association between smoking and influenza infection seen in the general population and further supports recommendations for tobacco cessation in this population.9 Since HIV-uninfected individuals were not simultaneously enrolled, it is not possible to determine whether HIV itself is a risk factor for severe disease; however, the high rates of subjects requiring ICU admission (41%), mechanical ventilation (59%), and discharge to a higher level of care than on admission (15%) highlight the severity of illness associated with respiratory viral infections in PLH. These findings support prior studies in resource-limited settings or that included subjects with poor HIV control found higher rates of hospitalization, longer lengths of stay, and increased need for supplemental oxygen in PLH compared to HIV-uninfected subjects with viral infection.[5][6][7] These findings combined with the low rates of influenza vaccination-only 25% of subjects' influenza were vaccinated, and overall cohort had a 46% vaccination rateindicate a missed opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality among PLH.A substantial proportion of those admitted with a respiratory infection had suboptimally controlled HIV infection, and we are unable to determine whether this was due to recent HIV diagnosis, non-adherence, or another cause. However, the high burden of respiratory viral infections and marked severity of illness occurred across a wide range of HIV control, including 17 (63%) subjects with undetectable HIV viral loads. While the most severe disease was more common in subjects with lower CD4 counts and higher viral loads, 6/11 (55%) of subjects requiring ICU level care had an undetectable HIV viral load. Understanding the mechanisms that drive the severity of illness associated with respiratory viral infections in people living with HIV will be important to develop more effective therapeutic strategies. The rate of respiratory viral infections among PLH found in this study also argues for routine respiratory viral diagnostics in the care of PLH with respiratory complaints. Of the 27 subjects diagnosed with a respiratory viral infection, four were identified retrospectively during research testing as part of this study. An undiagnosed viral infection can have significant clinical implications, including unnecessary antibiotic administration and/ or the use of therapies that could be harmful in the setting of viral infection such as corticosteroids, 10,11 in addition to potential nosocomial spread. NGS represents an expansion of diagnostic capacity with the potential to identify viruses not included in the primer-dependent panel including new or re-emerging viruses. The ability of NGS to detect genetically distinct rhinoviruses provides proof of principle regarding the utility of NGS to detect viral variants.Strengths of this study include evaluation of a large cohort of PLH with respiratory symptoms to characterize the burden of respiratory viruses in symptomatic PLH. Combination of both traditional rRT-PCR and NGS diagnostics also represents a novel and thorough method of characterization. However, there are important limitations that should be considered. Foremost, this study was conducted in a single academic center and was limited to adults.",

PLH \u2265 18 years of age requiring admission between 08/2015 and 08/2018 were approached for enrollment sequentially on weekdays if they had a respiratory symptom (predefined as cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, rhinorrhea, wheezing, or stridor) documented as new and present on admission. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. This study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of North Carolina. Clinical information including demographics, presenting symptoms, laboratory chemistries and hematology, medical history, medications, CD4 cell count and HIV plasma viral load, utilization of supplemental oxygen and critical care resources, microbiologic results, radiographic evaluation, and clinical outcomes of hospital course were collected by chart review. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for each patient were collected in viral transport media and stored at \u221280\u00b0C within 24 hours of enrollment. Excess sample from bronchoalveolar lavage was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C if a clinically indicated bronchoscopy was performed. The eSensor RVP (GenMark) rRT-PCR platform was used to detect influenza A, influenza A H1, influenza A H3, influenza A 2009 H1N1, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus A, Samples collected from individuals enrolled between August 2015 and August 2016 were also tested for RNA respiratory viruses using primer-agnostic next-generation deep genome sequencing (Supplemental Methods).",

Another option is the transition to longer read platforms as longer reads are able to detect viruses with less homology to existing genomes, that is, novel pathogens. Lastly, one could add a pre-selection/ pre-amplification step, analogous to current, gene-targeted specialized NGS panels for cancer and other disease. Such a strategy would trade an increase in sensitivity, for the ability of NGS to detect novel respiratory pathogens, that is, genomes that were not included in rRT-PCR or NGS-enrichment-PCR panels.",
