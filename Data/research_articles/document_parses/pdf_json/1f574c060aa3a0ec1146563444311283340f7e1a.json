To investigate the benefits and costs of contact tracing, we develop an individual-based contact-network model and a susceptible-exposed-infected-confirmed (SEIC) epidemic model for the stochastic simulations of COVID-19 transmission. We estimate the unknown parameters (reproductive ratio R 0 and confirmed rate \u03b4 2 ) by using observed confirmed case data. After a two month-lockdown, states in the USA have started the reopening process. We provide simulations for four different reopening situations: under \"stay-at-home\" order or no reopening, 25 % reopening, 50 % reopening, and 75 % reopening. We model contact tracing in a two-layer network by modifying the basic SEIC epidemic model. The two-layer network is composed by the contact network in the first layer and the tracing network in the second layer. Since the full contact list of an infected individual patient can be hard to obtain, then we consider different fractions of contacts from 60% to 5%. The goal of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of contact tracing to control the COVID-19 spreading in the reopening process. In terms of benefits, simulation results show that increasing the fraction of traced contacts decreases the size of the epidemic. For example, tracing 20% of the contacts is enough for all four reopening scenarios to reduce the epidemic size by half. Considering : medRxiv preprint the act of quarantining susceptible households as the contact tracing cost, we have observed an interesting phenomenon.

These uncertain characteristics make epidemic modeling challenging as the outcomes of the model are sensitive to the assumption made on the uncertainties. Therefore, we use a simple epidemic model with four compartments -susceptible-exposed-infected-confirmed (SEIC)-capable of imitating the COVID-19 transmission and flexible enough to cope with new 35 information. This model has only two unknown parameters: the reproductive ratio R 0 , and the confirmed case rate or reporting rate \u03b4 2 .

We consider that a confirmed COVID-19 patient cannot spread the disease anymore except in his/her 40 own household. In the spreading of COVID-19, there are pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases that do not show any sign of illness [4] . Besides, there is a strong possibility that infected cases not detected exist.
