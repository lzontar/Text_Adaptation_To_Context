Both belonging to thrombus, acute arterial thrombus is white thrombus, while acute venous thrombus is red thrombus. What does the pathological difference mean? Venous thrombosis can autolyze, while arterial thrombosis cannot. For VTE patients, oral anticoagulants are usually recommended for 3, 6, or 12 months and occasionally lifelong, but the course cannot be determined. Furthermore, even with standard anticoagulation therapy and INR, some patients still develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Thus, the physicians are extremely puzzled about anticoagulant usage. Proposed risk factors for VTE include advanced age, infection, malignancy, autoimmune disease, surgery, trauma, pregnancy, long trip syndrome, family history, AMI, heart failure, and so on. Relevant risk factors are increasing over time. Risk factors are derived from the summary of evidence-based medicine. Although these factors are found to be associated with venous thrombosis, the intrinsic factors have not been well elucidated [1] [2] [3] [4] .",

In the same group, the \u03b2 subunit is identical, but the \u03b1 subunit is distinct. At rest, the \u03b1 subunit is covered by the \u03b2 subunit, and thus the integrin is unable to bind to its ligands. Following activation, the extension of the \u03b2 subunit exposes the \u03b1 subunit. The \u03b1 subunit mainly mediates the specific and reversible binding between integrins and their ligands (Figs. 1.9 and 1.10), and the \u03b2 subunit dominates the signal transduction and regulation of integrins affinity [7] [8] [9] .

In simple terms, the immune system functions to expel all the foreign bodies including exogenous pathogenic microorganisms, grafts, foreign bodies in the wound, toxins, senescent cells, and malignant cells. The immune system can be divided into innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is present from birth and is also known as congenital immunity. Innate immune is an evolutionarily ancient defense strategy and is mainly composed of macrophages, granulocytes, NK cells, and complement system. Innate immune can recognize and subsequently clear foreign bodies and then present the information of these foreign bodies to T helper cells in adaptive immune. Adaptive immune is an acquired system during the lifetime of the organism. Immunological memory is a characteristic of adaptive immune and is highly specific to a particular pathogen. Thus, adaptive immune is also known as specific immune system and is composed of T cells and B cells. T helper cells are the core of the immune cells that regulate the cellular immunity and humoral immunity as well as the functions of phagocytes. Under physiological conditions, the alloantigens (pathogenic microorganisms or malignant cells) in the circulation can be effectively and timely recognized and cleared by immune cells. In the vein, cells with intracellular infection and malignant cells cannot be killed and cleared by immune cells, implying that the immune cells lose their function and are unable to maintain the defense. Under such conditions, a new compensatory defense should be initiated.",

Results showed the combined immune function (killing of target cells) was lost. NK cells, CD 8 + T cells, and complement form membrane attack complex to kill the target cells in which the perforin drills a hole in the target cells, leading to the release of granzymes and the death of these target cells. The mutation of the perforin gene may cause the generation of abnormal protein ( Fig. 1.21b) , resulting in loss of function. In patients with symptomatic PE, genomic analysis showed the mRNA expression of granzyme in T cells reduced significantly, suggesting the compromised killing activity of T cells. Although perforin and granzyme act at different steps of killing of target cells, the gene mutation of perforin in familial VTE patients and reduced mRNA expression of granzyme in patients with symptomatic PE cause the same consequence: compromised killing activity of immune cells [25] .",

Two large-scale case-control studies also revealed that acute infection could increase the risk for VTE by two-to threefolds after adjusting for other risk factors [27, 28] . In a patient who died of SARS, DVT was found in multiple organs including the pulmonary artery, kidney, liver, and pancreas, suggesting that viral infection is closely related to the pathogenesis of VTE (Fig. 1.22 ) [29] . A group of patients with acute PE showed significantly compromised function of CD 3 + and CD 8 + cells [30] ; a group of patients with CTEPH displayed markedly compromised function of CD 3 + and CD 8 + cells [31] ; a group of patients with acute symptomatic VTE presented reduced/disordered expression of CD 3 + , CD 8 + , CD 16 + ,CD 56 + , and CD 19 + , which was observed in 95% of these patients [32] . The results from cytological examination are consistent with those from genomic analysis and both indicate the compromised immune cell balance. T cells are the core component of immune cells. In T helper (Th) cells, Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells may regulate cellular, humoral, and innate immunity, respectively. The compromised T cell function may significantly reduce the systemic immune function. The collapse of immune cell balance function refers to the nonfunctional state or a state of significantly compromised function of immune cells. In VTE patients, cytological examination reveals that the T cell function is significantly compromised, and genomic analysis indicates that the function 3   II1 II2  II3   I1  I2   II4  II5  II6  II7  II8  II9  II10   III1   IVI   III2  III3  III4   + of systemic immune cells is significantly inhibited.

The risk for VTE in malignancy patients is 4-7 times higher than in subjects without malignancy [36] [37] [38] . The occurrence of malignancy is a consequence of ineffective and delayed clearance of malignant cells by immune cells. We reported that there were necrosis, granulation tissues and rupture of small veins on the sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma, and dark-staining fibrinogen in the vein formed filament-like mesh [13, 14] . In addition, in the necrotic area of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach, a large amount of red cells were observed outside the blood vessels ( Fig. 1.23 around the veins, and dark-staining fibrinogen formed filament-like mesh in which there were a large amount of cancer cells; the filament-like mesh was able to block the hematogenous metastasis of cancer cells. Based on these findings, we speculate that the occurrence of VTE and hemorrhage in malignancy patients is consequent to the invasion of cancer cells into surrounding veins and arteries due to the unlimited proliferation of cancer cells and is a product in the proliferative phase of cancer cells.",
