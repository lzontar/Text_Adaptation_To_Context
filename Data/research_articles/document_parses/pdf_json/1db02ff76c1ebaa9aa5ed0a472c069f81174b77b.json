So, this study was conducted to explore the effects of L-theanine on the intestinal microbiome and immune response in a broiler. A total of 400-d-old chicks were randomly divided into four treatment groups (A, B, C, and D) using a complete randomized design. Treatments were as follows: A, control (basal diet); B, basal diet + 100 mg L-theanine/kg diet; C, basal diet + 200 mg L-theanine/kg diet; and D, basal diet + 300 mg L-theanine/kg diet. Mucosal samples from ileum and jejunum of broiler chicken were extracted at 21 and 42 d of age. Extraction of genomic DNA was followed by amplification of V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA. After Illumina sequencing, results revealed that treatment with L-theanine signif-icantly increased the population of Lactobacillus in ileum and jejunum as compared to a control group, but the higher population was observed in jejunum at both 21 and 42 d of age. The overall diversity of the jejunum microbiome in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the ileum and control group (P < 0.05). Results of this study revealed that mRNA expression of TLRs (TLR-2 and TLR-4) and cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-2) was decreased in response to treatment with L-theanine. Moreover, the negative correlation of abundance of Lactobacillus was observed with expression of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 in the intestine and these effects were highly significant (P < 0.01). In summary, our finding revealed that dietary supplementation of L-theanine exhibited a positive influence on intestinal bacteria by supporting beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus while decreasing harmful microbes like Clostridium.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "A healthy gut can help birds to gain optimum growth performance because gastrointestinal tract (GI) is meant for digestion/absorption of nutrients and immune response. The mucosal membrane of the intestine serves as a barrier between luminal digesta and tissues and requires a dynamic balance between different components of gut like epithelial cells, microbiome, and immune system cells for proper functioning. One of the most important components that affect intestinal mucosal barrier is microbiota because gut health is mediated by commensal microbes influencing the development of structure and morphology of gut (Kamada et al., 2013) .

Microbiota produces butyrate, propionate, and acetate, which provide epithelial cells with energy and also influence mucosal barrier (Topping and Clifton 2001) .

Therefore, the second most important functional role of the gut after nutrient absorption is pathogen defense. The gut components that mediate host immune system include an intestinal mucosal layer, epithelial cells, and immunoglobulin A, and antimicrobial peptides. The microbiota is responsible for enhancing intestinal immunity through mediation of toll-like receptor (TLR) expression (Lundin et al., 2008) , antigenic response, and lymph follicles (Lee and Mazmanian, 2010; Belkaid 842 and Hand, 2014) , as well as by affecting systemic immunity (Noverr and Huffnagle, 2004) . The most significant component of intestinal immunity includes a protective covering of mucus gel that contains mucin glycoproteins synthesized and secreted by goblet cells in gut epithelium (Hollingsworth and Swanson, 2004; Dharmani et al., 2009; Forder et al., 2012) . This mucin layer promotes the passage rate of digesta and serves as a protective covering against injuries caused by feed, microbes, and their products. This specialized mucin protective covering has two layers in which outer loose layer allows microbial colonization, while inner compact layer inhibits attachment of bacteria acting as first line of defense against pathogenic infection (Brisbin et al., 2008; Johansson et al., 2010) . The changes in normal intestinal microbiota have been associated with modification of goblets cells ultimately changing the composition of intestinal mucus. Such mediations in microbial populations and/or host-derived inflammatory mediators are coupled with alteration of expression of mucin thus directly affecting composition or secretion of mucus. Comparison of conventionally reared broiler and germ-free broiler chicks revealed differential mucin profile and increased goblet cells in the intestine (Forder et al., 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 138, "text": "(Gaskins, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 529, "end": 550, "text": "(Lundin et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 593, "end": 618, "text": "(Lee and Mazmanian, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 619, "end": 646, "text": "Belkaid 842 and Hand, 2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 691, "end": 719, "text": "(Noverr and Huffnagle, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 913, "end": 946, "text": "(Hollingsworth and Swanson, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 947, "end": 969, "text": "Dharmani et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 970, "end": 990, "text": "Forder et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1403, "text": "(Brisbin et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1427, "text": "Johansson et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1934, "end": 1955, "text": "(Forder et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Gut microbiome not only modulates antibodymediated response but also greatly influences cellmediated immune components. Studies have reported significant effects of complexity of intestinal microbiome on gut T cell repertoire in chicken (Mwangi et al., 2010) . For example, Lactobacillus species have exhibited their ability to induce differential cytokine expression in T cells of chicken cecal tonsils that could contribute to intestinal homeostasis (Brisbin et al., 2012) . Additionally, a significant decrease in expression of important cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3) has been observed in the response of treatment with a blend of probiotic bacteria (L. acidophilus, B. bifidum, and S. faecalis) in Salmonella typhimurium challenged broiler chicken (Haghighi et al., 2008) . It is evident from different studies that commensal bacteria of the intestine (at least some of them) significantly affect the immune system of the bird along with pathogenic and probiotic strains. The predominant bacterial species in the gut mainly include: lactic acid bacteria (55%), rods (44%), and pathogens (\u223c1%). The relative abundance of the microbial community in the gut is affected by many factors that predominantly include feed, age, use of feed additives, and pathogenic infection. Such changes in gut microflora can potentially modulate performance of host by affecting growth rate, immune status, and maturity (Apajalahti and Vienola, 2016) . Keeping in view the importance of intestinal microbiome, it seems plausible to evaluate different additives that can affect colonization of intestinal microbiota to improve immune response in chicken. Green tea has shown its potential in improving the antioxidant status and immune function in animals. Polyphenols and amino acids (L-theanine) in green tea have been suggested to have the potential to modulate the immune system and intestinal microflora. Moreover, numerous studies on the administration of green tea (L-theanine) in calves and pigs have exhibited improvement in intestinal microflora balance demonstrated by increased fecal Lactobacillus and decreased Clostridia (Hara et al., 1995; Ishihara et al., 2001) . In our previous study, growth performance data of birds revealed that dietary supplementation of L-theanine at a dose rate of 200 mg/kg showed better results in terms of weight gain, meat quality, immune response, and feed conversion ratio (FCR; Saeed et al., 2018) .

Relative abundance of different bacterial species is also very divergent across different sections of the GT as a preference for species colonization widely varies among bacterial taxa. Results of the relative abundance of intestinal microflora observed in this study are consistent with earlier researches that reported that predominant phylum of bacteria in the chicken gut is Firmicutes. Their abundance ranges from 50% to 90% of total bacterial population in the ceca (Qu et al., 2008; Danzeisen et al., 2011) , while Firmicutes (mainly Lactobacilli) generally form more than 90% of all taxa in other segments of gut like ileum and jejunum (Gong et al., 2007; Rehman et al., 2007; Qu et al., 2008; Danzeisen et al., 2011) . A large variation has been observed in microbiota composition between individual broiler chickens. These differences occur even in animals managed under the same dietary and environmental conditions (Stanley et al., 2016) . Conditions such as stress, immunological development, and epigenetic factors may be involved, which results in high inter-individual diversity in intestinal microbiota composition. Effect of L-theanine in increasing abundance of Firmicutes is significant in both ileum and jejunum mucosa and exhibits its potential for modulation of the gut microbiome in broilers. Recently, a study (Shaufi et al., 2015) also reported Firmicutes as most abundant bacterial phylum (>70% of all bacterial sequences) in the ileum of chicken at all ages. They also reported that Firmicutes was also abundant phylum (48%) in caeca of chicken at 42 d of age, which has also been reported previously (Wei et al., 2013) .

Lactobacilli are commonly considered as a sign of healthy gut (Snel et al., 1995) being relatively more abundant in the chicken ileum (Lu et al., 2003) . A flow of digesta is more rapid in the proximal part of the intestine (duodenum), which ultimately results in reduced numbers of bacterial harboring on average 103 to 105 cells g \u22121 of digesta. However, distal small intestine (ileum) harbors a greater number of bacteria (108 to 109 cells g \u22121 digesta) and possesses a highly diverse bacterial population. Many factors could contribute to a variable composition of intestinal microbes, among which significant factors include the type of feed, species, variable rearing and environmental conditions, and different techniques used for analysis. There are various possible modes of action like competitive exclusion and adjustment of the microbial population like Lactobacillus in intestinal microflora (Fang et al., 2000; Frece et al., 2009) . The microbial diversity and structures of community of gut microbial population are reported to be significantly affected by dietary ingredients (Knarreborg et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2003) bird's age (Lu et al., 2003; Zhu and Joerger, 2003; Amit-Romach et al., 2004) and administration of drugs like antibiotics (Knarreborg et al., 2002; Smirnov et al., 2005) . Modulation of intestinal microbiome by L-theanine as revealed by this study provides strong evidence of its influence on body weight gain and immunity of broilers. Dietary supplementation of L-theanine increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus (>90%) that ultimately made the gut environment conducive for efficient nutrient absorption, metabolism, and better intestinal immunity. L-theanine is a unique amino acid that is only found in tea naturally and is responsible for many physiological roles of green tea (Juneja et al., 1999) . The precise mechanism that how Ltheanine manipulated gut microbiota is not clear but these potential effects are beneficial for chicken as a healthy gut is responsible for proper nutrient absorp-tion, utilization, and immune response. L-theanine enhanced expression of occludin and ZO-1 that are normally required for formation of TJ proteins, which are the first line of defense against a pathogenic attack on intestinal epithelium. Both innate and adaptive immunity are critically affected by super family of tumor necrosis factors that modulate inflammatory process, apoptosis, and proliferation of cells (Kaiser and St\u00e4heli, 2008) . Supplementation of directly fed microbes containing Bacillus has been reported to modulate expression of immune-related cytokines leading to improved immune response. Decrease in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and increase in antiinflammatory cytokine (IL-10) has also been reported in the intestine of chicken fed on probiotic (L. casei, L. acidophilus, B. thermophilum, and E. faecium) supplemented diet for 21 d (Chichlowski et al., 2007) . Similarly, treatment with L. fermentum reduced the TLR2 level, without affecting TLR4. Various studies have reported mediation of immune functions in response to supplementation of diet with Lactobacilli (Lopez et al., 2008; Llopis et al., 2009) . These results imply that beneficial microbiota containing Lactobacilli can regulate intestinal immunity and modulate cytokines and TLR levels to ameliorate inflammation (Cao et al., 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 167, "text": "(Fuller, 1997)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 192, "end": 211, "text": "(Guan et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 276, "end": 295, "text": "(Snel et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 348, "end": 365, "text": "(Lu et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1138, "text": "(Fang et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1158, "text": "Frece et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1331, "text": "(Knarreborg et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1348, "text": "Lu et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1377, "text": "(Lu et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1400, "text": "Zhu and Joerger, 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1426, "text": "Amit-Romach et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1497, "text": "(Knarreborg et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1519, "text": "Smirnov et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2038, "end": 2059, "text": "(Juneja et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2670, "end": 2696, "text": "(Kaiser and St\u00e4heli, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3131, "end": 3157, "text": "(Chichlowski et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3364, "end": 3384, "text": "(Lopez et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3385, "end": 3405, "text": "Llopis et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3577, "end": 3595, "text": "(Cao et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "L-theanine modulates immunity and growth response by exerting two-fold effects; one by favoring beneficial gut microbiota by increasing their relative abundance that reduces pathogenic load by competitive exclusion.

Earlier reports have also demonstrated this ability of L-theanine to inhibit stress-induced inflammatory response by decreasing serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels in mice (Jiang et al., 2012) . Moreover, it was also observed that L-theanine is potentially responsible for downregulation of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) along with improving the anti-oxidant ability of cells affected by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) toxicity. Theanine is not an anti-oxidant but enhances the activity of anti-oxidant enzyme activities and increases the concentration of glutathione (GSH). Many studies have shown favorable role of L-theanine on immune system as revealed by epidemiological studies and experiments on cell cultures, animals and humans (Kim et al., 2008; Chattopadhyay et al., 2011; D'Arena et al., 2013; Kuo et al., 2014; Huijun wang et al., 2014) . After oral intake of L-theanine, it is absorbed in blood through the gut and hydrolyzes in glutamic acid and ethylamine in liver and intestine (Tsuge et al., 2003; Scheid et al., 2012) . This ethylamine is capable of the proliferation of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes that are subsets of T-cells and act as the first line of defense in case of pathogenic attack as reported in a clinical study (Rowe et al., 2007) . So these potential effects of L-theanine by enhancing proliferation of T lymphocytes while decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory response mediate immune response effectively. Results revealed that L-theanine-mediated growth and immune response in broiler by modulation of intestinal microbiome that ultimately influences better nutrient utilization and metabolism along with positively influencing intestinal immunity. This mediation of intestinal microbiome was also coupled with the reduction of pathogenic bacteria in gut and regulation of expression of inflammatory cytokines and TLRs in the intestine that provided two-fold responses in terms of growth and immune response.
