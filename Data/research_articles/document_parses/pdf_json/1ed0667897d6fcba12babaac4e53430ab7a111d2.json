            "text": "Pandemic and epidemic diseases such as CoVID-19, SARS-CoV2, and Ebola have spread to multiple countries and infected thousands of people. Such diseases spread mainly through person-to-person contacts. Health care authorities recommend contact tracing procedures to prevent the spread to a vast population. Although several mobile applications have been developed to trace contacts, they typically require collection of privacy-intrusive information such as GPS locations, and the logging of privacy-sensitive data on a third party server, or require additional infrastructure such as WiFi APs with known locations. In this paper, we introduce CONTAIN, a privacy-oriented mobile contact tracing application that does not rely on GPS or any other form of infrastructure-based location sensing, nor the continuous logging of any other personally identifiable information on a server. The goal of CONTAIN is to allow users to determine with complete privacy if they have been within a short distance, specifically, Bluetooth wireless range, of someone that is infected, and potentially also when. We identify and prove the privacy guarantees provided by our approach. Our simulation study utilizing an empirical trace dataset (Asturies) involving 100 mobile devices and around 60000 records shows that users can maximize their possibility of identifying if they were near an infected user by turning on the app during active times.",

On the one hand, the approaches requiring self-reporting are not reliable since the individuals may not honestly report the information to the government authorities. On the other hand, the infrastructuredependent methods work only when the mobile device is in the proximity of the infrastructure; note that the GPS reception is not reliable in indoor environments. EPIC [1] and ENACT [8] were developed to trace contacts using a mobile application in a privacypreserving manner. While they avoid the use of GPS, these frameworks rely on a wireless access point.

We show how to leverage the users' mobile devices sending anonymous encrypted or random messages to each other via Bluetooth to allow users to determine with a 100% privacy if they have been in range of an infected user in the past, and when. There is no collection of privacy sensitive GPS, no reliance on external infrastructure for location tracking, no continuous logging of personally identifiable information from users. Specifically we introduce two privacy-friendly contact tracing protocols for CONTAIN; The first protocol uses symmetric key encryption, while the second protocol requires the secure generation of sufficiently large random numbers. In a way, they are duals of each other: the first protocol nodes upload the messages they have heard, while in the second protocol, the nodes upload the messages they have sent. Both protocols provide privacy for users that are not infected as such users never need to reveal their identity or contacts. Both protocols offer users with opt-in measures to get verified and declare if they are infected, while still maintaining some measure of privacy for the general public as they do not need to reveal their true identities or those of their contacts or the locations they have visited to everyone. And both protocols allow users to privately detect if they have had contacts with others that are infected.",

Almost every individual is carrying a highly capable mobile device (smartphone). The core processes of the CONTAIN application run on user's smartphones. We describe below two different protocols that can be used for the CONTAIN application, one based on encrypted beacons (see Section 3.3) and one based on random beacons (see Section 3.4). The CONTAIN application does not rely on or require GPS (in a given implementation of it, it may be possible to additionally allow users to reveal GPS information to the application on an opt-in basis, but this is not an essential part or requirement of our design). \u2022 Bluetooth technology Bluetooth is one of the widely used communication technology in contemporary smartphones. Today, this technology is used for short-range communication with hands-free earphones and external Bluetoothbased devices such as speakers and other audio systems. The communication range of Bluetooth is on the order of 10 meters or less [3] . \u2022 Verification server The smartphone and the Bluetooth technology can be used to gather contact traces in a private manner, which is discussed in Section 3.3 and 3.4. A third-party server is required to verify the infection status of a user (than claims to be infected) and then to make anonymous information from that infected user available for other users to use, in a private manner, to verify if they have been near the infected user.",

(1) Each user periodically beacons, using Bluetooth, a message, M, consisting of a unique name or ID, a time-stamp, and a random number (salt) that changes over time. Each message is encrypted using a symmetric key enc(M). Note that the users do not share this key with others. (2) Other users that hear the encrypted message beacon log it locally. (3) Either periodically or in a batch, on an opt-in basis, each user can upload all the encrypted beacon messages they have heard to a common verification server.

(6) Each other user j can privately check these now publicly available encrypted messages to see if they can decrypt any of them. Note that this verification process could be automated. If any user manages to decrypt the message, then he or she is at risk as he or she has been near an infected person. In this case, the user should then proceed to get tested themselves.

The use of a salt that can be changed each time further makes it so that there is no way to connect a particular individual or device with the logged data since it will be different each time the salt is changed. In protocol 2, the beacons consist of random numbers that can also change each time, so again, there is no identifying information being transmitted. Neither protocol requires collection of any location information.

For this scenario, we sort the time slots for each user according to the number of devices that the user connected to in that time slot. The second criterion for sorting is the crowdedness of the area that the user is. We measure the crowd level of an area by counting the number of records that we have in each time slot. Then, during an experiment where the user turns on for k slots, it does so for the first k slots in the sorted order. \u2022 Centralized: In this scenario, we assume that there is some centralized coordination mechanism that ensures that all users turn on their Bluetooth and run the CONTAIN app at specific hours of the day. In this scenario, we sort the time slots according to first the average number of active mobile devices, and second the number of records that we have in each hour in the dataset.

That is why such a small contagiousness probability and also initially infected people results in a considerable number of infected users. Consequently, as we can see in Figure 5 , our application informs many more people in case more number of them actively use the Bluetooth-based CONTAIN application. In this way, people can be alerted to get tested, take care of themselves and not spread the virus among other people by restricting their activities and avoiding crowded areas.",

It is also interesting to see that decentralized scenario results in more number of people being detected as potentially infected and required to do the test as compared to the centralized scenario. This is because, if each person turns his or her Bluetooth in the places where lots of other people are available (this is evident from the dataset that we used in our study), much more number of encounters will be recorded as compared to the centralized rule, which does not fit everyone's activity.",
