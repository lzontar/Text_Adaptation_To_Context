On one side, scientists are focusing on vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose models that can help us in understanding the spread of these pandemics as it can help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared, especially from pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reason for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical area, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and social coherence in the different regions of the world is non-uniform. Thus, once the epidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an important role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR model for epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic situations. To the best of our knowledge, this model is first of its kind, which takes into account the population distribution and connectivity of different geographic locations across the globe. In addition to presenting the mathematical proof of our model, we have performed extensive simulations using synthetic data to demonstrate our model's generalizability. To demonstrate the wider scope of our model, we used our model to forecast the COVID-19 cases for Estonia.",

As in the last decade, we have seen several pandemics such as H1N1, SARS, EBOLA, and presently in 2020 humanity is facing its biggest crisis due to COVID-19. The severity of these pandemics can be understood by the death toll claimed by them. According to WHO, the pandemic H1N1/09 virus resulted in 18,036 deaths [1] . On the other hand, the CDC estimate between 151,700 to 575,400 deaths due to the pandemic H1N1/09 virus [2] . Currently, the coronavirus (COVID- 19) pandemic, which started in December 2019 from Wuhan, China has infected 2,404,249 individuals and claimed 165,229 (as of 20 th April 2020) deaths worldwide [3] [4] . Pandemics are different from epidemics in terms of their geographic spread. An epidemic affects many people at the same time. It spreads from person to person and remains local to a specific region. In comparison, when an epidemic engulfs an entire country, continent, or the whole world, it is termed as pandemic.",

In this study, we proposed a mobility-based model, an extension to the classical SIR based epidemic model, which considers the realworld population distribution across different regions of the world. Most importantly, the model also takes into account the connectivity factor among various regions of the world, which is the key cause in accelerating the process of transforming epidemics into pandemics. We model the regions in a 2dimensional lattice, where each cell represents the mobility parameter (or direct connectivity) from one region to another. Along with presenting the mathematical proof of our model, we have performed extensive simulations on synthetic data and forecast the COVID-19 cases in Estonia 1 by inferring the interaction among individuals through call data records between Estonian counties to demonstrate the model's ability to generalize on different types of data.",

Thus, the infection can transfer within the region with the transmission rate \u03b2 and can also be introduced from other regions through global transmission rate which depends upon \u03b1, c (i,j) , I j (fraction of infected at region j) and \u03b2.

The limitation of classical compartmental epidemiological models is that they do not take into account the importance of reducing social connectivity (or isolation) and the significance of mobility restriction during the spreading of a pandemic such as COVID-19. This limitation is overcome in the proposed model. We found that the reproduction number R 0 for a pandemic depends upon the social connectivity and mobility parameter. We also discovered that during a pandemic, restricting mobility reduces the fraction of individuals in an infected compartment and reducing the social connectivity (or isolation) delays the peak and also reduces the number of infected individuals from the pandemic. We believe that this model can help to adopt a balanced strategy to address a pandemic crisis.",

Apart from SIR based models, there exist different flavors of compartmental models, which represent different scenarios such as SIS [13] , where individuals do not recover and can become susceptible again.

Fig. 3a to 3d displays the pandemic dynamics with different percentile of mobility restrictions of highly connected locations starting with 0% to 30% (keeping \u03b1 = 0.5).

We can infer that social connectivity parameter '\u03b1' and mobility both plays an important role during pandemics. Therefore, it is advisable to follow a dual strategy approach during a pandemic outbreak as controlling mobility reduces the fraction of infected individuals and \u03b1 delays the peak. Furthermore, we analysed the number of days required to reach the point where highest fraction of individuals get infected (see Figure 5 ). This indicates that mobility restrictions and minimal social contact will postpone the pandemic's peak and will give sufficient time for the preparations especially for the health sector.",

For the local transmission of the virus (within the county), we consider the reproduction number R 0 = 2.5 [40] . Cases reported until 11 th March, 2020 are considered as initial condition for the model. The reason behind selecting 11 th March, 2020 as initial condition is that, till this date no local transmission of the virus was reported 2 . Till the day of initial condition, the Estonian Health Board confirmed 13 cases in Harju and two cases in Tartumaa and Saaremaa each 3 . During the simulation, the number of cases in all other counties are initialized to zero. The infection rate \u03b2 and recovery rate \u00b5 are adjusted according to the value of R 0 for COVID-19. By 10 th April 2020, reported cases in Estonia and forecast cases using the model are shown in Fig. 7 . It can be noticed that the model predicted much higher cases of COVID-19 if no restrictions are introduced (\u03b1 = 1). However, as the restrictions were introduced by the Government 4 the number of cases got damped (Actual). Thus, the applicability of this model is to forecast a range of predicted number of cases which can help the governmental and health agencies to understand the impact and introduce proportional interventions to restrict the spread of the epidemic.",

We have simulated the proposed model considering three different origins of the infection, namely random location, weakly connected location and strongly connected location.

This indicates that introducing isolation and quarantine is effective in fighting a pandemic crisis. Using the proposed model, we also simulated the real world scenario by considering the COVID-19 cases in Estonia. Simulation reveals that the mobility based SIR model can be helpful to forecast the expected number of cases after some proportion of isolation and quarantine is introduced in the society.",

Local Transmission Let, N i be the population at location i, where i \u2208 l and the total population is divided into three compartments. The compartments for location i at time t are as follows: 1) S i (t): the number of individuals susceptible or not yet infected. This compartment is referred as susceptible compartment. 2) I i (t): the number of infected individuals which can further spread the disease to the individuals present in the susceptible compartment. This compartment is referred to as infected compartment. 3) R i (t): the number of individuals who have been recovered from infected compartment. This compartment is referred as recovered compartment. Our assumptions regarding the transmission of an individual from one compartment to another compartment are as follows:1) A healthy individual after becoming infected moves from susceptible to the infected compartment. 2) An individual can recovered spontaneously at any time with the recovery rate \u00b5. The recovery of an individual is independent of healthy and infected compartment individuals. 3) Once the individual gets recovered, it will become immune to the disease and thus, will not transmit the infection to individuals in the susceptible compartment. 4) In addition, this model ignores the demography that is birth or death of individuals.
