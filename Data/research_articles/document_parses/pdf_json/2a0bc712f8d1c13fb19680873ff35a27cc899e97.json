Such a curve collapse is much less convincing when normalizing by the total population. Sweden, with its no-lockdown, light-touch approach, is the only outlier that deviates considerably from the average behavior. We argue that these modelfree findings provide strong support for the effectiveness of the lockdowns in mitigating the lethality of the virus. 1 For another study emphasizing the universality of the dynamics across countries, see [10] .",

The time shift is such that the time origin coincides with the starting of the restriction measures in each country, t lock . We already see a strong hint of the effect of the lockdown: all curves peak roughly 20 days after t lock , independently of when the lockdown was actually implemented. Since the number of cases at the moment of the lockdown (i.e. the development stage of the epidemic) varies from country to country, this is already quite remarkable. 1 Furthermore, the plot shows that Germany has one of the lowest death rates per inhabitants while Belgium one of the highest. If the reproduction rate of the virus was still above 1 after the beginning of the lockdown, it would have eventually reached the whole population. Since one expects a similar fraction of susceptible people, roughly the same fraction of the population should have died in all countries. In other words, we would in that case expect a collapse of all the curves for different European countries when normalized by the total population size. Instead, Fig. 1a) shows that countries that responded faster, had a much smaller impact in terms of daily deaths contradicting our initial assumption of a freely circulating virus.",

If this was true, the collapse of the curves should happen when normalized by the number of infected at the time of lockdown (t lock ) instead of the total population. Since we do not have the real number of infected at t lock , we use a proxy given by the total number of deaths from lockdown t lock up to the latest available time t . Indeed, the total number of deaths in perfect isolation, is proportional to the number of infected at the first day of lockdown.

As mentioned above, all the curves show a peak at t peak \u223c20 days after t lock . This value is also equal to typical time from infection to death,T lag . Thus, most of the individuals that contributed to the daily deaths were infectedT lag days before the peak, exactly at t lock . We want to stress that the distribution of time from infection to death, \u03c1(T lag ), is log-normal, i.e. very broad and not sharply peaked as was assumed by the author of Ref. [2] . This means that the results presented in [2] are misleading. If the distribution of time from infection to death, \u03c1(T lag ), was sharply peaked aroundT lag days with a variance \u03c3, we could have learned the death growth rate (called \u03b3 in [2] ) in absence of lockdown measures simply by fitting the curves from patient-0 day to time t lock +T lag \u2212 \u03c3. But in fact \u03c1(T lag ) has fat tails: people start dying much before the average lag time. This means that the effect of lockdown on the daily deaths curves was already important from day 1 toT lag after t lock , while this effect is completely disregarded in the analysis of Ref. [2] . q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qqq qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q qq q q qq qq qq days from lockdown daily deaths/total deaths q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q q q q q qqq q q q qqq qq q q normalized up to t* normalized to total population Figure 2 : The dots and the error bars show the average and the dispersion of the 10-days moving average curves shown in Figure 1a ) (red) and in Figure 1b ) (black).

Unraveling the net effect of lockdown with respect to less extreme measures like social distancing and the demand to wear masks is not easy. Still, since Sweden never enforced strict lockdown but only light-touch measures, we can compare the Swedish national data with the rest of European countries (see Figure 3 ). The plot shows how the functional form of the curves is very different. We can identify two strong features that are specific to Sweden: first, the peak of the Sweden curve (blue curve) is delayed by \u223c 10 days and does not coincide withT lag ; second the Sweden curve has a fat tail, that decays much slower than in other countries. This suggests that, if European countries had followed Sweden's example, they would have paid a much higher cost in terms of human lives.",

Arguing that the effect of the lockdown could not be visible until the average delay from rising of the symptoms to deaths, some papers, like [2] , even claimed that in absence of any lockdown measures the number of deaths would have been less than actually observed. As shown in [3] , this is not the case. The distribution of time delay from infection to death is very broad (log-normal) and positively skewed, so we expect that more than half of the people would have died before the average lag time.
