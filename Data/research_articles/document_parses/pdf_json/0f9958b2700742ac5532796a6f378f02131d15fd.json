The Public Health Agency of Canada has created the core competencies for public health to guide the development, delivery and evaluation of MPH programs. In Canada, a capstone project is the recommended method of evaluating the MPH graduate's ability to demonstrate proficiency in the public health core competencies. A business plan that develops the framework for a public health program is an ideal capstone project currently used in practice within the University of Guelph MPH program. This group assignment incorporates all 36 of the public health core competencies while providing students with a real-world public health experience, and should be considered for inclusion within MPH programs across Canada. Business planning provides students the opportunity to engage in practicebased learning, applying theoretical knowledge to practice. Further, the ability to develop realistic but financially feasible public health problems is an invaluable skill for MPH graduates.

Given that the majority of students in MPH programs come from a science background, budgeting and financial planning is not something with which they have much experience.

Cost-benefit analysis, cost-utility analysis, and cost-effectiveness measures are becoming increasingly common as measures of program success and continuance. Recognizing and understanding these measures and including them within the overall structure of a business plan helps public health professionals create new programs in areas of public health need, and allow the continuation of effective public health programs. Business plans can be used to develop new programs, lend support to existing programs, and prioritize ongoing programs by identifying those that are most successful. They can also help to increase the effectiveness of program delivery. Having experience with business plan development during graduate training helps to ensure that future public health professionals have the necessary skill set to develop the most successful programs possible. The act of developing a business plan helps the public health professional focus the program and identifies efficiencies. Furthermore, the conclusion of a business plan can determine the feasibility of the public health program. Identifying that the plan is not appropriate at a particular time due to financial, political, social, environmental, or other such constraints is valuable knowledge given limited financial resources. This paper is a summary of the intended learning outcomes of the business planning exercise provided by the primary author, supported by the student reported findings from a focus group held at the University of Guelph in January 2013. Students who had completed the Public Health Administration course were presented with the core competencies and asked to describe how the business plan impacted their acquisition or enhancement of each of the individual competencies.

Students who worked closely with community agencies to develop their business plan, were able to develop a more comprehensive and realistic program plan. Moving forward, all groups of students will work with a community agency to create a business plan that will be used in practice. Working with organizations to develop programs based on identified need take competencies covered in the business plan one step further, from theoretical to applied. Students who engaged in two-way knowledge exchange with community agencies to complete the business plan felt that they were able to accelerate their learning as they are able to build community capacity and contribute to developing key values and a shared vision in program planning within the community [7.6, 7.2] . At the same time, they were able to provide a significant benefit for community agencies, as the partnerships facilitate program development in areas with limited capacity.

Students agree that in order to successfully complete the business planning exercise, they are required to review epidemiological evidence, identify and analyze relevant information from multiple sources, and partake in stakeholder engagement, demonstrating their ability to engage in evidence-informed decision-making. Further, the financial component of a business plan allows them exposure to budgeting and financial concepts in a public health setting. This provides real-world experience that will aid in cost-benefit analysis, and developing administrative and organizational structures including implementation plans, as they undertake managerial tasks into the future.

By bringing all of their knowledge together to create a single deliverable, students are able to validate their learning in the MPH program. The attitudes and values of public health professionals are an important component of effective practice, and business planning allows students to apply the public health problem-solving paradigm to evaluate and address a real-life public health problem. Coming up with a comprehensive and feasible solution requires a significant amount of time and effort, thus students assume ownership of the plan and become invested in the outcome. This desire for program success to effectively build capacity to respond to a given health issue, combined with the unique opportunity for students to demonstrate knowledge of all of the essential building blocks of public health practice, makes the business planning exercise an ideal capstone project for MPH programs in Canada and adequately prepares students for a successful future in the public health sector.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Demonstrating excellence in practice-based teaching for public health.
