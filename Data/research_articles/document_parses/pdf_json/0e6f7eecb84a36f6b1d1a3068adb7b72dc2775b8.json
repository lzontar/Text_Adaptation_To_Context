We recently reported survival to ICU discharge of 74% for 1,205 patients treated during the first six years of the network service 1 . The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic showed the effectiveness of referral and transfer to an ECMO centre in adults with severe acute respiratory failure suggested by the CESAR trial 2, 3 , and was a driver of the creation of the national ECMO network in England. Since its inception, clinicians have anticipated and planned for the potential future need for surge capacity related to pandemic respiratory illness. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of ECMO beds available was increased from 15 to 100, and centres were designated to formally cover referrals from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland 4 .",

Although the scoring systems listed have not been validated in some patient populations (e.g. Clinical Frailty Score 5 in patients < 65 yr old), and clearly not validated in COVID-19 viral pneumonitis, the aim of the criteria is to standardise and triage patients on referral. In addition, this strategy ensures that clinicians should involve at least one other ECMO centre in deciding if it is appropriate to proceed with a patient with a lower probability of benefit (e.g., lower RESP score 6 ).",
