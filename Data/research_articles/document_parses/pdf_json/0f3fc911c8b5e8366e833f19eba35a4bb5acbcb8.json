Pepscan of the SE protein demonstrated that SE16 ( 722 SSTFNSTREL 731 ) is the minimal linear epitope required for reactivity with the mAb 2E10.

The S2 domain forms the trans-membrane structure of the S protein, but can not induce neutralizing antibodies [23] . These properties make it possible that the S1 could be a suitable candidate for screening and identifying antigenic epitopes. Epitopes are important antigenic elements of virus structural proteins, which could induce antibody production and cell-mediated immunity against viruses. Therefore, epitopes are essential to develop epitope-based vaccines and diagnostics. Preparation of mAb is required to identify the epitopes of the S1 protein. We had tried to use intact S1 protein to immunize mice, but it was unsuccessful to get the mice serum with immune activity. Because of unidentified but complex factors, we chose to divide the S1 protein into five fragments (SA, SB, SC, SD, SE). The five truncated proteins were expressed and the immunogenicity of the proteins was identified. These results indicated that the SE protein (666-789 aa) had good reactivity as the immunodominant region of S1 protein. Then the SE protein was selected as an immunogen to elicit the formation of monoclonal antibody. After cell fusion and four times of selection, mAb 2E10 was chosen because of its specific reactivity with the SE protein as well as the native S protein PEDV.",

            "text": "Several domains containing neutralizing epitopes within the S protein were identified, such as residues 499-638 [24] , residues 636-798 [25] , residues 592-607 [26] and residues 575-639 [27] . These mocking epitopes had antigenic similarities with the PEDV neutralizing epitopes. In this study, we expressed a series of truncated proteins (SE1-SE6) to map the epitopes of SE protein. The SE6 protein could be recognized by mAb 2E10. Generally, linear epitopes consist of six to nine or more continuous amino acid residues. So, the pepscan method was used to Fig. 4 Pepscan of the epitopes SE6 and localization of the epitopes recognized by the mAb 2E10. a ELISA analysis of the truncated peptides SE6-SE16 with mAb 2E10 and PBS. The surface b and cartoon c from SE16 was labeled in the sequence chain view picture of PEDV S, obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB, ID: 6U7K). d The structural features of SE16 were predicted by PROTEAN software. The epitope SE16 was shown in the boxes truncate the epitope SE6 by deleting three amino acids at either the amino or the carboxy terminus in sequence respectively. A total of ten sub-segments (SE7-SE16) was synthesized and the results of ELISA suggested that SE16 could react with mAb 2E10. Above all these results, the epitope SE16 is the immunodominant region of PEDV S protein. The epitope SE16 ( 722 SSTFNSTREL 731 ) was highly conserved among different strains of virulent PEDV. Further, the 3D structural visualization showed that the epitope SE16 presented on the surface of PEDV S and had a feature of high antigenic index and hydrophilicity. The character of this location makes this epitope easily explore and induce host immune response in the infected animals.",
