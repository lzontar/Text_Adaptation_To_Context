            "text": "A qualitative risk assessment was conducted to determine 1) the likelihood of introduction of Asian lineage H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus by migratory birds into the EU, 2) the likelihood of it becoming endemic in wild birds in the EU and 3) the likelihood of transmission of infection to domestic poultry. The conclusions reached included that the probability of the virus being released into the EU varied between low and high, depending on the species of migratory birds. A minority opinion was noted concluding that the risk was medium across species. In the light of this risk, it was recommended to educate poultry keepers in currently affected countries outside the EU in relation to minimum biosecurity standards. Surveillance should be enhanced in these countries in domestic poultry and wild birds, and vaccination programmes should be considered for controlling the infection. Trade with poultry and their products needs to be managed considering the risks of spreading virus between geographical areas. Research needs to be conducted to improve surveillance methods in poultry and widl birds. Wild bird migration data needs to be analysed to better understand the flyways used by the various species. The risk of the virus becoming endemic in European wild bird populations was considered to vary between low and high depending on species. A minority opinion was received concluding that this risk was medium across species. This risk could be reduced by intensifying surveillance in wild birds within the EU, and use the data to inform biosecurity measures in domestic birds. The behaviour of wild birds within the EU needs to be better studied so that the dynamics of transmission within and between species are better understood. The final step of the risk assessment indicates that there is a negligible risk of the virus infecting domestic poultry kept under a high biosecurity standard and not in high poultry density areas. The risk increases to very low if they are kept in high poultry density areas. For backyard and free-range poultry, and any poultry not kept under high biosecurity standards, it was concluded that the risk of introduction of Asian lineage H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus to the flock was low to medium. These risks emphasize the need to make better use of existing and new migratory bird behaviour data. Passive and active surveillance for AI in wild birds needs to be intensified. It should focus on the species identified in this risk assessment. Biosecurity measures for poultry holdings need to be reviewed, and research needs to be conducted to optimise their effectiveness. Poultry holdings should not be built in the vicinity of wetland areas. New vaccines and their use need to be researched. ",

In addition, the Commission assumes that EFSA will continue to closely monitor any further scientific developments in this field and specially those related to the risk posed by wild birds and particularly migratory birds in the spread of the Asian lineage H5N1 HPAI virus (HPAIV) in order to produce an update of the recently published opinion as relevant new information and evidence becomes available.",

The identification of risk factors to be considered by Member States in order to classify regions or establishments as being at increased risk of exposure from the Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV carried by wild birds. Based on this specification, it needs to be emphasized that pathways other than those of wild birds that are known or hypothesised to exist and are relevant to the introduction of the Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV to the EU were deliberately excluded from this assessment. This means that the conclusions from the current risk assessment do not have a comparative element with other possible paths of introduction of the virus into the EU. Such pathways are considered explicitly in the EFSA scientific opinion \"Animal health and welfare aspects of Avian Influenza\" (EFSA 2005) . EFSA is also working on a Scientific Opinion on \"Animal Health and Welfare risks associated with the import of wild birds other than poultry into the EU\", where avian influenza is also considered. An overall balanced assessment of the risk of entry of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV to the EU must, however, take into consideration all the possible routes of transmission, including factors assessed in both reports. This risk assessment (RA) -addressing the risk questions specified by the Commission-follows the methodology for RA (which can be summarised as: assessing risk release, exposure, consequences and overall risk estimation), as defined by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE 2004a) . This risk assessment was conducted as a qualitative assessment, since a quantitative approach would have required detailed epidemiological information which currently is not available for this disease. Within the qualitative risk assessment, probabilities are assessed and described textually on a scale from negligible (meaning that they cannot be differentiated from zero, and in practical terms can be ignored), through to very high (see Table  1 .1). They are based on the data presented by the Working Group and evaluated in the scientific report (www.efsa.eu.int), and are internally consistent across the different risk questions included in the risk assessment. As no quantitative assessment has been undertaken, they cannot be placed on a precise numerical scale. However probability, mathematically, has a range from 0 to 1 and the textual descriptions used in the table are to be interpreted within this range. In addition to the risk estimate, the level of uncertainty is indicated in the results of this risk assessment. In the context of this risk assessment variation and uncertainty were both presented as uncertainty. The terms and criteria for usage are listed in Table 1 .2. There are solid and complete data available; strong evidence is provided in multiple references; authors report similar conclusions.",

The disadvantages of virus isolation techniques are that they are time-consuming, and can only be performed safely under high biosecurity conditions if highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are to be expected. It has been shown previously that virus genome detection by RT-PCR provides a rapid, sensitive and convenient alternative for virus isolation. These tests can be designed to detect all avian influenza A viruses, or specific influenza A virus subtypes, such as H5 or H7. Real-time RT-PCR assays generally employ single-tube format, are fast, and have the additional advantage that a specific probe facilitates detection of positive samples and increases assay specificity. Serological sampling lacks the sensitivity to be of use for routine screening or confirmatory diagnosis of avian influenza, particularly as part of outbreak investigations. The currently available serological tests do not all distinguish between HP and LP strains. Furthermore, positive serological findings give no indication of current infection status. It may be of use for obtaining broard estimates of infection levels in wild bird populations.",

Single-tube RT-PCR should be employed where possible to minimise the risk of cross contamination between different samples. Upon the identification of positive specimens, viral genetic material may be amplified by PCR and sequenced, and/or used for virus isolation and further characterisation by haemagglutination inhibition assays under appropriate conditions. For H5-positive samples, the original specimens should subsequently be used for virus isolation in 10 to 12-day-old embryonated chicken eggs under BSL3+ conditions. If the initial virus isolation attempt is unsuccessful, a blind passage of the allantoic fluid of the inocculated eggs should be performed. Virus isolates are subsequently characterised using hemagglutination inhibition assays or neuraminidase inhibition assays with subtype-specific antisera. Alternatively, the H and N genes may be characterised by nucleotide sequencing. Nucleotide sequencing of the protease cleavage site in the H gene is an appropriate method to determine if the virus has a highly pathogenic genotype. The pathogenicity of influenza viruses may further be determined using the intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) in chickens (OIE manual of diagnostic tests; EU Directive 2005/94); Full genome sequencing of H5N1 HPAI viruses should be employed to determine the genetic relationship with other known strains.

Influenza A virus positive specimens should subsequently be tested in RT-PCR assays specific for the H5 gene. Such assays should also be evaluated using recent H5N1 HPAIV isolates from around the world. The relative specificity and sensitivity of the diagnostic methods utilised in surveillance programs needs to be determined. Development of rapid sensitive screening assays that minimise the need for cold-chain will be advantageous.

Selecting Migratory Bird Species at Higher Risk of Becoming Exposed to Asian Lineage H5N1 HPAIV 8.4.1. Methodology 8.4.1.1. Initial list of species considered Only birds from the orders Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans) and Charadriiformes (waders and gulls) are considered. 8.4.1.2. Factors associated with exposure to H5N1 HPAIV infection in migratory birds Expert opinion and basic epidemiological principles suggest that species which are highly gregarious are more likely to become infected with Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV since close contact between birds may result in the virus being more readily passed from bird to bird within flocks. Two components of gregariousness can be assessed, group size and group density. The Greenland race of Greater White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons flavirostris was evaluated separately on the basis of significantly smaller group sizes and lower degree of mixing (below) compare to the nominate race A. a. albifrons which largely occurs on continental Europe. 8.4.1.2.1. Degree of mixing during migration/wintering periods Species which readily mix with other species of waterbirds are thought to be more likely to become infected with Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV since contact between species may result in the viral infection. Likewise, it is assumed that species which do not come into close contact with other species are at lower risk of infection. As with gregariousness, there is currently no evidence to support this assumption. 8.4.1.2.2. Main habitat during migration/wintering Habitat is assumed to be of importance with respect to the chances of a species becoming infected with AI viruses (outside the EU) as well as with chances that it may subsequently transmit it to other birds within the EU. As with gregariousness and mixing, there is currently no evidence to support this assumption, although it is reasonable to assume that a species occurring solely at sea poses considerably less risk of coming into contact with poultry than a species that uses agricultural habitats of a type also frequented by free-range poultry. Where more than one habitat is used multiple coding has been applied. Note that the sequence of habitat code elements indicates relative use of the different habitats. Thus the code MF indicates that the species primarily occurs in marine areas but also can use freshwater habitats, whilst FM would indicate the converse.",

There is a continuing risk of introduction of AI from infected wild birds into poultry populations that may come into contact directly or indirectly with domestic poultry (EFSA, 2005) . As a result surveillance systems have been enhanced in many areas especially Europe, both in wild birds and poultry, to better understand virus epidemiology and provide better early warning systems for detection of virus in poultry populations. A prototype for a surveillance system has been developed by Swedish and Dutch researchers and been in operation in The Netherlands and Sweden since 2002. System of sampling and specimen processing critically affect the outcome of laboratory tests. Methods should examine materials collected from both live and dead birds. Screening by the use of RT-PCR targeting the matrix gene is an effective methodology that is highly sensitive and should be supported by attempted isolation of virus from PCR positive specimens to provide virus for further characterisation where possible.

Ideally the catching and sampling systems should be harmonised between different sites across EU and beyond to allow meaningful interpretation of the prevalence and temporal patterns of the occurrence of different AI subtypes in specific bird populations. The statistical properties of the sampling schemes need to be considered when interpreting the data. Biases affecting bird selection need to be recorded, and considered in data interpretation. The potential host species of Asian H5N1 HPAI virus are largely unknown, and may be different from the natural hosts of LPAI viruses. Thus, monitoring a wider range of potential host species may be desirable. In addition, the existing surveillance networks should be adapted to include bird species that have the potential to migrate directly from areas where the Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV has been detected in poultry and/or wild birds (see Chapter 10 of the Scientific Report, ww.efsa.eu.int). Surveillance studies should include provision for timely examination of unusual wild bird mortality incidents involving one or more species in a single region or location. This is especially critical for evidence gathering in the context of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV presence in birds in areas that were previously considered to be free of the virus. Appropriate health and safety precautions need to be defined for people collecting samples that may potentially contain zoonotic pathogens. A formal European network for wild bird surveillance should be established to facilitate data collection across member states, enhancement of data analysis to map migratory pathways and to provide a structured uniform programme of targeted surveillance in wild bird populations. Such a programme should also create a web-based system to act as a means of rapid dissemination of surveillance results. In addition, it is recommended to set up a global laboratory network to complement the diagnostic support currently provided by internationally recognized laboratories such as Weybridge (EU) and Padova (OIE).",

To avoid ambiguity, reporting of such information should: i) involve the use of Latin species names; and ii) use a standardised taxonomic reference. In this respect the taxonomy of Sibley and Monroe (1990, with corrections of 1993) is recommended.

Biosecurity measures at poultry farm level are incorporated in different pieces of EU legislation and include animal health and welfare measures, measures for control of environmental contamination, the reporting of suspected outbreaks of disease to the competent authority and for keeping of farm records. The actions of slaughterhouse operators are also the subject of statutory measures. Biosecurity requirements for the marketing of live poultry are currently being regulated by Council Directive 90/539/EEC. Currently, in case of suspicion and confirmation of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV outbreaks in poultry, the EU statutory legislation oversees the stamping-out of infected and suspected poultry, the identification of possible contacts via epidemiological inquiries, the restriction of movements for poultry commodities, waste, vehicles and persons, the set-up of zoning (protection and surveillance zones, the cleaning and disinfection of infected premises, vehicles and equipment and also the implementation of emergency vaccination of poultry flocks. Following recent outbreaks of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV the following set of measures has been put in place by EU legislation:",

Situations where there is a limited or no mixing would reduce the probability of exposure to a negligible level. Gregariousness of a bird species is thought to be directly related to the probability of exposure to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV because the probability of cross infection increases with the number and density of birds in any areas. Birds living solitarily or in small groups (few tens of birds) resulting in low density of birds (>5 m between individuals) are thought to exhibit negligible probability of exposure. The habitat used by a bird species (during migration and wintering or breeding) is anticipated to affect the probability of exposure to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV with birds preferring marine and/or littoral habitats experiencing negligible probability of exposure. Both water chemistry and temperature influence the survival of the virus. Global infection status in relation to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV: the situation in winter and spring 2005/2006 is highly dynamic. The global distribution of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV alters the probability of virus circulation along flyways and at certain mixing and concentration areas. This in turn influences the European bird species at risk of exposure during migration. This assessment therefore needs to be continuously updated. Although bird migration is a complex and highly variable process, movement patterns for individual bird species can be described. Such knowledge of timing and location ranges from reasonable precision of timing (e.g. some goose populations) and location to general patterns with significant uncertainty levels. The probability of introduction of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV by a bird species is directly associated with the number of individual birds migrating into the EU. Species that are very common are presumed to have a higher risk (notably if they are susceptible) as a function of the greater numbers of individuals. Using these criteria, a decision tree for identifying migratory bird species with an increased probability of carrying Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV to the EU was developed based on data available in April 2006. Due to the dynamic situation at the time of writing, the factor \"migration through infected area\" was not applied. Factors \"susceptibility\", \"gregariousness\" and \"mixing\" were already considered. Applying this approach, a list of wild bird species of higher significance in terms of transmission of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV was obtained (Table 13.1, summary based on Table 11 .2 of the Scientific Report, www.efsa.eu.int). This list needs to be updated when new data related to any of the factors listed above become available. The list is not a closed list and should be regularly updated. It can be used as a framework for targeting surveillance efforts in migratory birds. It is emphasised that population size is another influential parameter for species prioritisation, which must be applied according to the regional situation. Probability that wild birds infected with Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV survive for extended periods and are able to travel long distances Currently available data suggests that the likelihood is medium (high uncertainty) for the species identified in Section 13.5.1.",

Table 13 .1 shows the preliminary list of bird species with higher probability to be exposed to Asian linage H5N1 HPAIV during migration outside the European Union.

The release assessment includes the estimation of the probability for this entire process. It considers how it can be affected by various factors including risk management measures. The resulting conditional probability of release of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV into the EU through wild birds which became infected outside the EU is medium (high uncertainty) (Table 13 .2). Using the interpretation given in Table 1 .1, this means that Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV can be expected to be released into the EU by migratory birds as a regular event (as distinct from rare or very often). It should be noted that this qualitative probability estimate is associated with a high level of uncertainty. It is particularly high as a result of the apparent variation of the pathogenicity of the virus in different species and their potential survival. There are a large number of species that are potentially affected but only one (Mallard Anas platyrhynchos) has been tested experimentally. This uncertainty affects both the migration to and from mixing and concentration areas. The probability of detection of infection in wild birds at mixing and concentration areas is extremely dependent on the level and type of surveillance, which is not standardised between countries.

Presence of susceptible non-migratory wild birds in EU Considering the conclusions drawn under 13.1.1 and the abundance and variety of wild birds in Europe, including species of documented susceptibility such as mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and mute swans (Cygnus olor), the probability of susceptible non-migratory bird species being present is very high (medium uncertainty), at least in some regions. However, systematic data on susceptibility differences between species are not available. Investigations conducted in Europe (Fouchier et al. 2003) documented isolations predominantly of low pathogenic AI virus from ducks, geese and gulls. Regional differences in the abundance of susceptible species are expected as a consequence of their distribution and habitats. If common species such as sparrows are confirmed to be susceptible (Kou et al. 2005) , the geographical differences may become less distinct. In early 2006, Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV was isolated repeatedly from wild birds in several European countries. Mute swans (Cygnus olor) were frequently overrepresented in these outbreaks which may indicate an increased pathogenicity of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV in these birds, or sampling bias owing to their high visibility and frequent association with habitats close to human habitation. 14.1.2.",

Based on available data, it is not possible to predict the most likely scenario.

Probability of detection of infection with Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV in migratory and non-migratory wild birds Surveillance for AI viruses in wild birds has been conducted in the EU since 1999. Surveillance activities are currently being expanded and are mandatory since 2005. Both passive and active surveillance programmes are in place in most MS.",

Whether this is due to an increased prevalence of virus or due to increased awareness and surveillance activities cannot be determined, although there has been an increase in surveillance activity by MS since the mandatory requirement was implemented. At present, the probability of detection of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV infection in wild birds is medium to high (high uncertainty) if the virus causes mortality (or sickness), if large and highly visible birds are affected and if the outbreak occurs in an area that is frequented by humans. In a scenario where the virus causes no clinical signs or if only birds in a remote area or small or less visible birds are affected, the probability of detection is low (low uncertainty).

Factors influencing the probability of exposure relating to infected migratory birds Influential factors with respect to the probability of exposure of domestic poultry are: Wild bird species carrying the virus, number of wild birds infected, time and location of introduction. A possible scenario will be that Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV is introduced into Europe via migrating waterbirds. It might then be transmitted to non-migratory waterbirds and/or to domestic poultry. The decision tree used to define the migratory wild bird species more likely to release Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV produced a list species shown in (Table 13 .1). This list was further refined using expert opinion to identify those migratory wild bird species which also are more likely to come into contact with domestic poultry (see Table 15 .1, summary based on Table 13 .1 of the Scientific Report, www.efsa.eu.int). EU Member States are situated over a large geographical area with diverse climate and habitats. The presence of migratory bird species at a given point in time is therefore variable between and within countries. No general statement can be made that is valid for all countries in terms of the probability of direct exposure of poultry to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV from wild birds. Factors influencing the probability of exposure relating to nonmigratory birds The probability of poultry exposure to non-migratory infected birds is influenced by the species of birds infected, the number of infected birds, the clinical signs in these birds and the contact between domestic and wild birds. Additionally, non-migratory bird species were identified that could act as bridge species (Table 15 .2, summary based on Table 10 .1). Bridge species were defined as birds that live in close proximity to domestic poultry -perhaps sharing buildings or food sources. The list is not a closed list and should be regularly updated. It can be used as the basis for targeting surveillance efforts in wild birds. EU Member States are situated over a large geographical area with diverse climate and habitats. The presence of wild bird species at a given point in time is therefore variable between and within countries. No general statement can be made that is valid for all countries in terms of the probability of exposure of poultry to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV from wild birds. Factors influencing the probability of indirect exposure of poultry Indirect exposure of poultry is higher than negligible if surface water is used to which migratory or non-migratory infected birds have also access. The probability of indirect transmission of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV via contaminated forage or soil is unknown. In general, the probability of indirect exposure is most strongly influenced by the type of poultry production system (e.g. free-range production) and the related biosecurity measures (EFSA, 2005) . Data from an outbreak in a UK quarantine facility suggests that aerosol transmission of infection from infected wild birds to chickens kept within the same airspace represents a very low risk. Infected predator species could become infected by consumption of infected wild bird carcasses. If they have access to poultry populations kept under low biosecurity, they could expose poultry to infection.",

In addition, the Commission assumes that EFSA will continue to closely monitor any further scientific developments in this field and specially those related to the risk posed by wild birds and particularly migratory birds in the spread of the Asian lineage H5N1 HPAI virus (HPAIV) in order to produce an update of the recently published opinion as relevant new information and evidence becomes available.",

The probability of introduction of the Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV by wild birds into Member States and the subsequent risk of a) the development of an endemic situation in wild birds in Member States and b) the transmission of the virus to domestic poultry and, 2. The identification of risk factors to be considered by Member States in order to classify regions or establishments as being at increased risk of exposure from the Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV carried by wild birds. Based on this specification, it needs to be emphasized that pathways other than those of wild birds that are known or hypothesised to exist and are relevant to the introduction of the Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV to the EU were deliberately excluded from this assessment. This means that the conclusions from the current risk assessment do not have a comparative element with other possible paths of introduction of the virus into the EU. Such pathways are considered explicitly in the EFSA scientific opinion \"Animal health and welfare aspects of Avian Influenza\" (EFSA 2005) . EFSA is also working on a Scientific Opinion on \"Animal Health and Welfare risks associated with the import of wild birds other than poultry into the EU\", where avian influenza is also considered. An overall balanced assessment of the risk of entry of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV to the EU must, however, take into consideration all the possible routes of transmission, including factors assessed in both reports. This risk assessment (RA) -addressing the risk questions specified by the Commission-follows the methodology for RA (which can be summarised as: assessing risk release, exposure, consequences and overall risk estimation), as defined by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE 2004a) . This risk assessment was conducted as a qualitative assessment, since a quantitative approach would have required detailed epidemiological information which currently is not available for this disease. Within the qualitative risk assessment, probabilities are assessed and described textually on a scale from negligible (meaning that they cannot be differentiated from zero, and in practical terms can be ignored), through to very high (see Table 3 .1). They are based on the data presented by the Working Group in this scientific report and are internally consistent across the different risk questions included in the risk assessment. As no quantitative assessment has been undertaken, they cannot be placed on a precise numerical scale. However probability, mathematically, has a range from 0 to 1 and the textual descriptions used in the table are to be interpreted within this range. In addition to the risk estimate, the level of uncertainty is indicated in the results of this risk assessment. In the context of this risk assessment variation and uncertainty were both presented as uncertainty. The terms and criteria for usage are listed in Table 3 .2. There are solid and complete data available; strong evidence is provided in multiple references; authors report similar conclusions.",

It is based on intravenous inoculation of 10 six-week old chickens with a standardized dose of the virus isolate to be tested. The chickens are observed over a period of ten days for clinical signs. Results of clinical investigations are integrated into an index which indicates a HPAI virus when values greater 1.2 are obtained. Alternatively, a HPAIV isolate is encountered when at least seven out of ten (70 %) inoculated chicken die within the observation period. The pathogenicity classification is specific to chickens, but similar results have been obtained for related birds in the Galliformes (Alexander et al. 1978; Perkins and Swayne 2001) . But it has also been reported that HP viruses have been LP for ducks (Alexander et al. 1978; Sturm-Ramirez et al. 2005) .",

While a number of point mutations in the PB2, NP and NS genes have been tentatively associated with increased virulence in mammals (Hatta et al. 2001; Gabriel et al. 2005; Seo et al. 2005) , the overall constellation of the gene segments seems to play a major role in the polygenic trait of influenza pathogenicity.

Wild birds of the Anseriforme and Charadriiforme Orders are a major reservoir of LPAI viruses (Webster et al. 1992; Kaleta et al. 2005) . Globig et al. (2006) sampled 3,183 wild birds between March 2003 and January 2005 from 80 different locations around Germany, and they examined them for infection with AIV. These were from 79 wild bird species from eleven Orders, particularly Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. They included locally resident as well as migrating wild bird species. Prevalence of AIV was 3.5% and 1.3% amongst pooled (n=1151) and individual (n=3183) samples, respectively. They detected 92.5% of all positive samples (n=40) in wild duck species. Infection prevalence was highest in ducks during autumn/early winter in the northern coastal parts of Germany with 9.8% of 194 pools on the island F\u00f6hr and 17.7% of 102 pools from the Baltic coast in Western Pomerania. The authors indicate that many of the infected species were migrating ducks which have their breeding grounds in Northern Europe and Asia. The same study also examined samples from 387 waders, none of which was positive for AIV. In a 2005 outbreak in Qinghaihu Lake, China, several wild bird species were affected, including the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus), great black-headed gull (Larus ichthyaetus), and brown-headed gull (Larus brunnicephalus) (Liu et al 2005) . The mortality figures have not been published. Small numbers of deaths in wild pigeons (Columba livia) have been reported from Turkey, Iraq and Romania in the context of larger scale outbreaks in domestic poultry (OIE 2006) .",

The data from the quarantine facility in UK suggests that under similar circumstances aerosol transmission of infection may not be as effective, as exposure to contaminated material such as faeces or direct contact. Excretion of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV as measured in experimentally inoculated mallards did not exceed 10 6.0 EID 50 . The amount of virus excreted and the duration of excretion is reduced for strains which exhibit low pathogenicity in ducks. Little information is available for other species but some species have been shown to excrete virus at much lower levels than have been recorded for ducks. Duration and magnitude of excretion varied according to the viral pathotype. Viruses expressing high pathogenicity in mallards were excreted for up to 17 days, whereas those of low pathogenicity ceased to be excreted between days 7 to 10 after infection.",

However, these viruses retain their highly pathogenic potential for gallinaceous birds, so the possibility that apparently healthy mallards may subclinically excrete and spread Asian lineage H5N1 virus highly pathogenic for Galliformes must be considered. Chen et al. (2005) present evidence that wild birds can carry H5N1 HPAIV and although the virus was found in apparently healthy migratory ducks, there is no evidence as to whether they were healthy enough to migrate long distances and so whether the virus could be transmitted over such long distances via this mechanism at this stage.

Numerically, more outbreaks occur in these smaller holdings even though, for a number of the infected countries, more poultry are raised in large farms.

(2005) reported that a total of 83% of infected flocks confirmed by laboratories were backyard chickens (56%) or ducks (27%). In Thailand, some areas of high poultry population density were less likely to be affected by H5N1 HPAIV than those with lower density, possibly reflecting the improved biosecurity and management practices of large industrial farms (production sector 1 and 2) located in these areas (Gilbert et al. 2006) .",

Biosecurity standards are assumed to have remained unaltered for those same farms. In addition there has been little or no government intervention to ensure that biosecurity was implemented. This factor probably played a role in the emergence of H5N1 HPAIV in Asia. (Songserm et al. 2006) . Cats were shown to be susceptible to experimental infection to which they responded with systemic lethal disease Rimmelzwaan et al. 2006 ). More recently, natural infections in cats have been reported during the outbreak of H5N1 HPAIV of a Qinghai-like virus lineage in wild birds in the northeast of Germany (Wolf et al. 2006) . Three cats and one stone marten succumbed to a systemic infection. At least one of these cats had been observed to have developed neurological signs. The exact sources of the infections were not identified, but the cats had been allowed to freely roam in an area where contact with carcasses of infected wild birds had been possible. In addition, there are also suggestions of dogs being susceptible to natural challenge with H5N1 in Thailand (Butler 2006) . Since this finding is based on serological data, a non-lethal course of the infection must be assumed for those particular dogs.",

These outbreaks affected aquatic birds which were kept in two parks. Individuals of several species of ducks, geese and swans as well as herons, egrets, and flamingos were affected. Domestic birds of gallinaceous species, kept in cages close to open ponds of these parks were not affected and proved to be free of virus.

Up to 6,000 wild birds died, among them highly migratory species such as the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) of which thousands were affected, in addition to cormorants and gulls that died of the infection. Recently, healthy tree sparrows (Passer montanus) in a province in central China were found to harbour and excrete H5N1 HPAIV of different genotypes (Kou et al. 2005) . These viruses were highly pathogenic for chickens but not for domestic ducks and mice. In addition, crows in Japan, magpies in Korea (Kwon et al. 2005 ), a peregrine falcon in Hong Kong (Li et al. 2004) and several passerine and psittacine species in Thailand, and -in a large ornithological collection -in Cambodia have been reported infected with Asian lineage H5N1 HPAI viruses. Mongolia reported the death of about 90 wild birds out of an otherwise healthy population of roughly 6,000, in lakes in the north of the country. H5N1 HPAIV was isolated from a dead whooper swan but not from healthy animals (OIE 2006) . The data presented in Table 7 .2 summarises reported isolation of H5N1 HPAIV in wild birds. (Pfeiffer 2005) . During that period, major outbreaks in poultry have occurred around the annual Tet holiday festivities from late December to March. The major areas affected in Vietnam have been concentrated around the Red River and Mekong River deltas in the North and South of the country, respectively (Pfeiffer 2005) . In Thailand, outbreaks were concentrated in the Central, the Southern part of the Northern, and eastern regions of Thailand which constitute wetland water reservoirs and dense poultry areas (Gilbert et al. 2006) .",

Multiple H5N1 HPAI viruses were detected in domestic poultry through surveillance of live bird markets in Hong Kong and southern China. In total, seven different genotypes were detected, including one goose/GD/96-like virus and six other genotypes that contained genes from other Type A influenza viruses, presumed to be from waterbirds. Of these genotypes at least three were very similar to viruses isolated previously from ducks and/or geese from southern China (Li et al. 2004; Sims et al. 2003) . Of these, one genotype has since become dominant -the so-called \"Z\" genotype (Li et al. 2004 ). These \"Z\" viruses have continued to evolve so that H5N1 'Z' genotype viruses isolated from the same location at different times, or those isolated from different countries at the same time have significant molecular and antigenic differences.

Although signs of declining rural populations and land aggregation are occurring in some countries, for instance, Thailand and to a small extent in China, it is anticipated that even in 2030 the majority of farms in the region will still be smallholdings. Farms in the region are dominantly smallholder-based with widespread occurrence of subsistence production systems. Presently, more than 36% of chickens and waterbirds of the world are found in the region. Figure 8 .6 shows the poultry density distribution in Asian countries. In Cambodia, traditional village chicken raising is carried out by about 90 -95% of all farming households.

Most households raise 20-30 chickens, predominantly in scavenging systems. Commercial poultry production in Lao PDR is found near centres of high population density such as Vientiane (Knips 2004 ). Most poultry production in Thailand takes place in commercial operations with the industry being dominated by large multinational companies. The broiler industry is completely integrated with feed-milling companies and mainly produces for export markets. In Thailand production has overtaken consumption since 1980 allowing for the development of a significant export industry. Net trade in poultry has risen 15-fold between 1990 and 2000 (Knips 2004 ). Poultry production plays a very important role for rural development in Vietnam. More than 80% of the poultry production in Vietnam is based on traditional production systems at the smallholder level, even though a number of families now keep flocks of between 1,000 and 10,000 birds. Some 70% of the chickens produced in Vietnam are local breeds raised outdoors with the remaining 30% divided amongst different foreign breeds. The main locations for chicken production are close to urban areas and provinces with large amounts of waste from food processing industries. Broiler chicken production is carried out by private farms, which are still financially weak and lack access to technology, health-care and marketing facilities (Knips 2004) . In China, poultry production is 20% of all livestock production with an estimated total of 5 billion heads of poultry in 2002 (FAO 2005a) . This country's annual growth rate in poultry production for the period between 1990 and 2000 was around 5% per year.

As an example, it has been reported by the Washington Post (2005) that the poultry industry in Indonesia requested delayed reporting of outbreaks in their farms from the the government. Consequentially, the first outbreaks were first reported several months after the first occurrence. A report produced by GRAIN, an international non-governmental organisation promoting the sustainable management and use of agricultural biodiversity, suggests that trade of live chickens is a more important source of infection than wild birds or backyard farming (Grain 2006).

During the following breeding season returning ducks or their (susceptible) offspring can become re-infected with viruses released by chance from melting ice (Ito et al. 1995) . It has been further hypothesised that influenza viruses can be preserved in environmental ice for prolonged time periods , and that ancient viruses and genotypes can recycle from this reservoir ). Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV was shown to be inactivated after three days in surface water coming from rice fields in Thailand . Webster et al. (1978) showed that an H3N6 AIV retained its infectivity for more than 30 days at 0\u00b0C and for a few days at ambient temperature. Stallknecht et al. (1990) described strain-and subtype-specific differences in inactivation slopes when measuring the retention of infectivity in distilled water of five different LPAI influenza virus strains. They concluded that certain strains seem to be adapted to prolonged survival in water at given temperatures although the (molecular) mechanisms involved remained obscure.

Evidence for transmission via aerosols has come primarily from studies of outbreaks where contact transmission could be excluded, such as outbreaks in a factory (Acheson and Hewitt 1952) , or in an aeroplane where 72% of passengers were infected with influenza in 4.5 hours without proof of direct contact with the index case (Moser et al. 1979 ). In addition, it has been shown that the minimal infectious dose of influenza is ~100-fold lower when administered via the lower respiratory tract as compared to nasal administration (Couch et al. 1971; Couch et al. 1983; Knight et al. 1970 ). Transmission of influenza virus via aerosols has been proven experimentally in mice (Schulman and Kilbourne 1963) .

Similar tests should be designed based on other parts of the viral genome, but it is important to ensure that the primer sequences are conserved in all avian influenza A viruses, including all described H5N1 HPAIV isolates. Influenza A virus positive specimens should subsequently be tested in RT-PCR assays specific for the H5 gene. Such assays should also be evaluated using recent H5N1 HPAIV isolates from around the world. The relative specificity and sensitivity of the diagnostic methods utilised in surveillance programs needs to be determined. Development of rapid sensitive screening assays that minimise the need for cold-chain will be advantageous. Studies should be undertaken to establish the validity of the molecular signature that discriminates HP/LP AIV with a view to using this to replace the current bioassay. Any bioassay for pathogenicity involving live birds should minimise suffering by killing birds at the earliest time after the scientific objective has been achieved, e.g. clinical signs of severe disease, rather than allowing the birds to die naturally (OECD 2000 The migration of birds has long been a subject of speculation and research, although scientific research into migration largely commenced with the advent of bird ringing schemes in 1919 (Bairlein 2001) . The individual marking of birds with metal rings has given information on movements between the different areas used by migratory birds during the course of their annual cycle. Basic concepts in bird migration have recently been summarised by Alerstam (1993) , Owen (1996) , Bairlein et al. (2002) and Rees et al.

Piersma (1987) described these different migration flights as either 'hop, skip or jump' strategies ( Figure 11 .1). : Piersma 1987. For some birds, typically some coastal waterbirds, migration is focussed in a narrow 'flyway'. Such flyways can be described either for individual species (e.g. Figure 11 .2 and Figure 11 .4) or be used as a concept to describe and summarise the broadly similar migration routes used by several species. Thus for waders, Figure 11 .3 shows the main flyways at a global scale, whilst for Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans), Isakov (1967) summarised four main flyways in western Eurasia (Figure 11 .5). Not only do migration patterns vary between different coastal waders within, for example, the East Atlantic Flyway (e.g. Figure 11 .4), but for many species such summary maps are not applicable at all. Thus, in Europe populations Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago and Eurasian Woodcock Scolopax rusticola migrate broadly from east to west across Eurasia, movements that are not described by the summary flyways in Figure 11 .3. Stroud et al. (2004) found that a small number (14) Other birds migrate on a broad front across wider geographical areas. Such broad-front migrants still show strong geographical orientation but movement for the population as a whole is more diffuse (e.g. Figure 11 .6).",

(2002)] Whilst migration is typically thought of as a seasonal phenomenon, in reality, there are bird movements year-round ( Figure 11 .7), but most species show distinct periods when increased mobility is apparent. Furthermore, even among longer-distance migrants, there are different strategies, with some species having populations that are wholly migratory (geographically separate breeding and wintering areas), whilst other species have populations which are resident (year-round presence in the same geographical area), or partially migratory (part of the population migrates and part of the population remains). Further differences in the extent of movement may relate to sex or age of bird. For example, differential migration by age is widely found in gulls and in several species of shorebirds, the tendency being for young birds to migrate further from the breeding grounds than mature adults, for example Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus . The reason for such variability stems from the evolutionary drive to balance over-winter survival and advantages in remaining close to the breeding grounds.",

Some wader species which have been the subject of intensive study have also been shown also to return to the same individual nesting territories year after year. Such site fidelity can be explained as a result of various selective pressures that favour individuals which have an intimate knowledge of their environment. Its consequence is that certain locations not only hold large concentrations of waterbirds year after year (Section 11.2 below) but that these sites are repeatedly visited by the same birds. Not all waterbirds show such strong site fidelity, and a range of strategies exist between species (e.g. Lappo 1996) . However, processes such as female philopatry (Rohwer and Anderson 1988; Rees et al. 2005 ) also encourage the exchange of individuals between different groups, so that the dispersal of birds within a population fosters subsequent genetic mixing. Typically, sites used by waterbirds hold similar numbers year after year, and the high predictability of numbers allows their formalised identification at key sites (Heath and Evans 2000) such as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention or as Special Protection Areas under the EC Birds Directive. Some variation on numbers does occur, often as a result of varying numbers of young, thus inflating population size in some years. This is particularly the case in some waterbirds which breed in the high Arctic where the effects of variable weather and other factors can result in years of excellent or very poor productivity ('boom' or 'bust'). Productivity in some such species is linked to changes in relative predator abundance, itself a consequence of the three year Lemming cycle. For Brent Geese Branta bernicla, there is a well-established cycle of a year where no young are produced, followed by a year in which there can be either poor or good productivity, then followed by a year of consistently high productivity (Summers and Underhill 1987) . Such cycles have been found for other species also (as reviewed by Newton 1998) and have consequences for the overall sizes of populations in the non-breeding season as well as for numbers at individual wetland sites.",

            "text": "Data Periods of prolonged cold weather can significantly alter numbers of waterbirds present in their wintering areas (Ridgill and Fox 1990) . The onset of frozen conditions can trigger significant population movements by some species as they disperse in search milder, more favourable conditions. Some examples are given in Annex 2. Under these cold conditions, numbers of waterbirds at sites in milder regions of Europe (typically the south and west) can be greatly inflated for short periods. Figure 11 .8 shows those parts of Europe which received net influxes of nine species of ducks in severe cold weather periods between 1967 and 1986. Figure 11 .8. Square areas of 50 x 50 km that were identified as refuges in periods of severe cold weather (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) Ridgill and Fox 1990) Notable refuge areas are southern Britain, Ireland, the coast and interior of NW France, Iberia (especially inland flood plains, Marshes of Guadalquivir, and the Ebro Delta), the Mediterranean coast of France (especially the Camargue), and estuarine areas of Italy (notably the Po Delta). Periods of extreme dry weather can also cause significant movements of waterbirds and thus changes in numbers at key sites (Kingsford 1996) . Whilst not typically a factor influencing waterbirds in Europe, shifting movements from drought areas or intermittent use of temporary wetlands in arid areas is typical of many African waterbirds (e.g. Harrison et al. 1997; Mulli\u00e9 et al. 1999) . Patterns of such 'rains migration' are hard to predict. Periods of severe drought in southern Europe will result in waterbird dispersal from dried up wetlands. Some wetlands vary significantly in seasonal patterns of use, especially the case for sites within continental Europe. A range of local factors can also influence numbers of waterbirds at sites. Probably of the greatest significance is disturbance -which can occur from a number of sources including hunting (Madsen 1995; Madsen and Fox 1995) . However, in the absence of positive conservation measures to influence site management, it is probable that disturbance levels will generally tend to be the same from year to year. Thus it is probable that a heavily disturbed site in one year will also tend to be heavily disturbed in the following year.",

            "text": "Data A combination of bird census data and bird ringing data (for example Fransson and Pettersson 2001; Wernham et al. 2002 ; van Roomen et al. 2004; Collier et al. 2005) have been instrumental in identifying sites of importance for migratory birds of different species, the timing of their use, and the origins and destinations of migrating birds. These data sources have shown the broad distributions of species and their flyways. Most information on movements comes from 'conventional' ringing which gives information only about the locations where the bird was ringed and where it subsequently was recovered or recaptured. Typically this can be many years later, and maps showing ringing and recovery locations should not be interpreted as indicating exact migration routes. For example, Figure 11 .9 shows ringing recoveries for the Greenland White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons flavirostris. All birds in this population are known to visit Iceland on spring and autumn migration, yet misinterpretation of this ringing recovery map might suggest direct movements to and from the breeding and wintering areas. Remote sensing, using radio or satellite telemetry, offers the great advantage of yielding detailed and precise information about the location (and sometimes also behaviour) of the individuals carrying transmitters. Miniature data loggers, for recording the behaviour of individuals, are also likely to become more widely used in the future. Radio-telemetry has been used very successfully for interpreting long distance migrations of even small waterbirds, notably Western Sandpipers Calidris mauri (Iverson et al. 1996) . There are currently some limitations to the technique, notably high costs, the high time cost of locating birds carrying transmitters, weight limitations for satellite transmitters (constraining their use on the smallest waterbirds, especially waders), and that generally results come from a few individuals that may not represent the behaviour of the population as a whole. However, costs and minimum size of transmitters are falling -increasing the number of individuals and species that can carry them. This will greatly increase the value of the technique. Satellite telemetry involves larger transmitters and more powerful batteries and to date its use has been largely restricted to migratory geese and swans, typically to investigate the detailed migration ecology of populations using well known flyways. The high costs of satellite telemetry will restrict its used for the foreseeable future. However, even though one consequence of this is its restriction to a small number of individuals, its use may be the only realistic means of obtaining information on migratory flyways for birds migrating through regions with few birdwatchers, or in which political instability restricts the potential for other forms of field studies.

Although there has been a long history of collection of data on bird ringing, there has been little investment in necessary analysis and synthesis, especially at international scales. The African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement recently noted: \"There have been few systematic reviews of waterbird population limits in recent years, despite the existence of a range of new methodologies that might be informative. Whilst some of these involve expensive technologies that are unlikely to be widely applied to large samples of birds, there are other approaches that could be readily applied and would be highly instructive with relatively limited investment. Simple consideration of existing, but un-analysed, data relating to waterbird ringing recoveries is capable of giving major new insights.\" 3 Existing maps of flyways largely derive from activity undertaken by the International Waterbird Research Bureau in the 1970s, or earlier, and there have been few contemporary analyses at continental scale. Thus, Wetlands International's Anatidae Atlas (Scott and Rose 1996) obtained its population limits for Common Teal Anas crecca (Figure 11 .10) from the earlier work of Monval and Pirot (1989) , who in turn had in turn drawn from Atkinson-Willes' summarisation (in the 1970s) of the work of Isakov (1967) . Isakov broadly defined two European flyways for ducks in Western Europe (Figure 11 .5): a Northern White Sea/North Sea population and a European Siberia/Black Sea-Mediterranean population. However, recent analysis of Teal ringing recoveries (Guillemain et al. 2005 ; Figure 11 .11) shows that there is actually little evidence for discrete populations of Common Teal but rather the European distribution should be considered as a continuum.",

However, there are networks of wetland sites that are of particular strategic importance for migratory waterbirds, providing essential stopovers where birds can refuel for onward flight, or safe areas for birds to moult and replace feathers (Sections 11.1.1, 11.1.2, Annex A). Many such sites are of regular importance, supporting large numbers of waterbirds each year (Heath and Evans 2000; Stroud et al. 2001; Stroud et al. 2004; Collier et al. 2005) . These sites may support resident, passage, and summering or wintering waterbirds, at the relevant time of year. A list of published and other sources of information about such sites (including national inventories) is given in Table 13 .2 for EU Member States. Not all sites within any one flyway will be used by all of the birds that move along that flyway as flight distances between staging posts vary between species (hop, skip, jump migratory strategies, Piersma 1987, Section 11.1.1). Furthermore, some of these mixing areas will be used as migration stopovers by birds from different breeding and wintering areas, and different flyways (e.g. Scott and Rose 1996; Wernham et al. 2002) . The timing of use also varies (e.g. Ens et al. 1994; Piersma 1994 , Section 11.1.1), with some sites used only on the northbound spring migration or the southbound autumn, whilst others may be used on both migrations (Stroud et al. 2004 , Section 11.1.1). Two categories of concentration or mixing areas have been distinguished in Figure 11 .13. These two categories, termed Primary and Secondary Sites, have been distinguished to highlight those locations known to consistently hold large concentrations of waterbirds, amongst the many wetland sites that constitute mixing areas for migratory waterbirds. Primary Sites are congregations of \u2265 20,000 waterbirds. There is a comprehensive network of internationally important sites for birds, Important Bird Areas (IBAs), identified by BirdLife International on the basis of quantitative ornithological criteria (Heath and Evans 2000) . IBAs are underpinned by data from the World Bird DataBase (BirdLife International 2005). Primary Sites shown on Figure 11 .13 are those meeting the Global IBA criterion for congregations, A4iii, and the European Union criterion, C7, for Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and candidate SPAs (Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds (Birds Directive).",

It is relatively easy to extract and exclude sites listed primarily for their (marine) seabird colonies, but is potentially misleading to apply further filters.

Consequently, Figure 11 .14 includes sites that hold important concentrations of waterbirds, but not necessarily primarily higher risk species of waterbird. Secondary Sites are all the remaining wetlands identified by the World Birds DataBase (WBDB) to have waterbird species. Some of these sites also may have large concentrations of higher risk species of waterbirds, but for the same reasons as for primary sites, data are not available in the WBDB to reliably elucidate this point.",

Data in the database vary from one site to another in terms of count-years available and submitted, completeness of data, and species for which counts have been undertaken. These facts, together with the paucity of information about detailed migration routes for many species, have limited the extent of filtering that can be undertaken to identify mixing sites just for higher risk species. Consequently, all sites meeting the criteria have been included, not just those in outbreak regions or in mixing areas used by migrating birds that come to EU countries. Thus the figure illustrates the many, widely distributed concentration and mixing areas for waterbirds including those within regions presently of concern due to H5N1 HPAIV. The region encompassing the Black Sea and Caspian Sea in particular represents a mixing area for birds, notably species of Anatidae, from several flyways and a region in which flyway boundaries are indistinct, e.g. Anas crecca, or where dispersive movements occur (Scott and Rose 1996, Section 11.1.3 this report). The other key source of information on concentrations of waterbirds and mixing areas used by migrating birds is the International Waterbird Census (IWC) ( Figure  11 .13 to Figure 11 .15) (Gilissen et al. 2002) . The frequency of count coverage for sites varies from one site to another, as indicated by Figure 11 .14 - Figure  11 .15, and our knowledge is far less complete for some areas than for others, for example South West Asia. Nonetheless, the IWC database does contain relevant data to enable an assessment of species occurrence across most or all sites in the database, minimally for the single count month of January. This is a necessary next step towards determining concentrations and mixing areas for higher risk species. Furthermore, analysis of EURING data (Baillie 1995) on movements by individually ringed birds of those species considered to be higher risk species (Section 11.2.2) will be necessary to elucidate those mixing and concentration areas utilised by higher risk species. These two necessary analyses, of IWC and EURING data, are the subject of a separate project being undertaken by Wetlands International and EURING under contract to the EuropeDG Environment of the European Commission (O'Briain pers. comm.).",

More interactive, GIS-based systems, internationally accessible through the internet might prove to be easier and more cost-effective to keep upto-date in the light of developing knowledge of waterbird populations.

            "text": "Data Migratory species occurring in EU countries include wintering birds from northern breeding areas, summering birds that winter further south, and passage migrants, as well as short distance migrants that remain within Europe. As described in Section 11.1.1, movements are often complex and the text here can offer only some broad generalisations. Summer visitors generally migrate southwards to overwinter, some migrating as far as South Africa. Passage migrants and winter visitors originate from breeding areas ranging from arctic Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia and across to Siberia, southwards throughout the EU. The proportion of avifauna comprising summer visitors, i.e. migrant birds that occur during the breeding season in Europe, increases with increasing latitude (Newton and Dale 1996) . This is because winter temperatures at higher latitudes make these areas unsuitable for overwintering, as illustrated by the isotherms in January indicating the extent of frozen wetlands (Figure 11 .16), so birds are forced to migrate to warmer climes to improve their overwinter survival. Within Europe, there is a cline in winter distribution, consistent with generally warmer winters in the south and west. Wintering populations in these areas are augmented during periods of severe weather by birds making cold weather movements (Ridgill and Fox 1990 , Section 11.1.3). The timing of migration is dependent on species, their origin and destination. In reality, there is a spectrum of bird movements throughout the year, with peaks during spring migration to generally more northerly breeding areas and autumn migration in a mainly southerly direction, when the largest numbers across many species are on the move. Spring migration may commence as early as late February/early March, continuing until late May/early June, and autumn migration may commence in June and continue until November (e.g. Collier et al. 2005) . Within these broad time periods, there are peaks of migratory activity, the timing of which varies with latitude. In the UK, for example, spring migration usually peaks in April/May, whilst autumn migration tends to peak during August to October. Furthermore, the duration of stopover by passage migrants varies greatly from brief refuelling stops of a few days to longer stays of several weeks to moult and so renew flight feathers. At such times, there is particularly high turnover of individual birds as some depart to be replaced by others (e.g. Frederiksen et al. 2001 ). Counts are not adequate to describe the numbers of birds actually using a site; turnover can be measured effectively only by the use of mark-recapture techniques (Schaub et al. 2001) . DG Environment of the European Commission have collated data on the timing of onset of both spring (pre-nuptial) and autumn (post-breeding) migration for species listed under Annex II of the EC Birds Directive for each of the EU15 Member States. These data are given on the website of the Birds Directive 4 . Figure 11 .16. Isotherms for the period 6 to 15 January 1999, with an interval of 5 degrees Celsius produced by NOAA-CIRES Climate Diagnostics Centre, Boulder, Colorado (Gilissen et al. 2002) Conclusions As well as seasonal migration, waterbirds can exhibit movements at other times of the year in response to extreme weather conditions, notably periods of prolonged cold weather in mid-winter. In these conditions, waterbirds may move considerable distances to seek milder weather conditions.",

Methodology A sequence of decision rules was devised based on expert opinion to identify the migratory bird species which are considered to be more likely to be exposed to H5N1 HPAIV. Species were identified based on distribution, ecology and behaviour suggesting that they may be more likely to become infected by Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV outside the EU. The factors considered are outlined in this section and applied in Section 11.5 to derive a list of species we consider are vulnerable to infection by H5N1 HPAIV. The relative population sizes of birds were considered but not used as a formal selection crtierion in the assessment of risk. Population sizes of European waterbirds range across six orders of magnitude (from <10 Slender-billed Curlews Numenius tenuirostris to c. 7,500,000 Mallards Anas platyrhynchos). Intuitively, it is the more numerous species whose behaviour makes them more likely to come into frequent contact with domestic poultry in Europe that are of increased risk to poultry if they are carrying H5N1 HPAIV. However, population size is correlated with other factors considered below, notably gregariousness, bird density within flocks, and degree of mixing. Most abundant species are likely to be those that are the most gregarious, occur at the highest densities and show the most mixing with other species. This assumption has not been demonstrated formally (and should be a future analytical priority), but for the time-being we consider that a separate filter related to population size would provide little extra discriminatory power. The following sections discuss the factors which form the basis of the decision rules.",

Wild birds that live in close proximity to domestic poultry, perhaps sharing buildings or food and water sources, can be considered as 'bridge species' in that they may have the potential to transmit virus from other wild birds to domestic poultry, if they are carrying the virus. An example of the possible role of such bridge species was given by Alexander and Spackman (1981) , who suggested that the Starlings Sturnus vulgaris may have been involved in an unprecedented series of outbreaks of highly pathogenic H7 infections in turkeys in eastern England in spring 1979. They noted that the severity of the preceding winter had damaged many of the turkey houses, allowing access to Starlings and other small birds searching for food in a period of scarcity. In this way, Starlings may have acted as a bridge for virus transmission from waterbirds in nearby wetlands to the turkey farms. Virus has been isolated from some of these bridge species, e.g. House Sparrow Passer domesticus (Perkins and Swayne 2003) . Kou et al. (2005) have recently highlighted the potential role of Tree Sparrows Passer montanus in transmission of H5N1 HPAIV between local poultry holdings in China. The bird species which could act as 'bridge species' for transmission of H5N1 HPAIV transmission to domestic poultry were categorised into 3 groups, as described below. Group 1: This comprises those feral birds which may be considered as domesticated poultry inasmuch as they are not of wild provenance. Group 2: This comprises wild birds most likely to occur in habitats shared with domestic poultry, at least for part of the year. The list is not exhaustive and is based on the following criteria: 1. Habitat. A rapid review of The EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997) , to identify those species primarily associated with farmland.",

Bird species observed to use areas also used by domestic poultry, based on direct, albeit limited, observations, relating to commercial free-range ducks and geese in a British context. 3. Gregarious species, at least outside the breeding season. Gregarious species, especially at higher density, are more likely to present opportunities for virus transmission than those species that tend to be solitary or occur in small numbers with little mixing or gregarious behaviour (see Section 11.4.3 above). 4. Mobility. Wild birds that range more widely in search of food are more likely to present opportunities for virus transmission than sedentary species. Wild birds are attracted to land used by free-ranging domestic ducks and geese, mainly feeding in the compartments once the domestic birds have been harvested, but to varying degrees utilising these habitats when still occupied by domestic birds (R. Langston, pers. obs.). Food availability is largely invertebrates associated with these fields, presumably enhanced by eutrophication arising from high densities of domestic birds, and weed seeds from peripheral areas and planted cover for poultry. Puddling of the ground by poultry generally leaves a lot of bare ground available for foraging by wild birds. Many candidate \"bridge\" species form flocks in winter, numbers ranging from several tens to hundreds, and flocks comprise both granivorous and insectivorous bird species. The extent to which flocks of farmland birds move around in winter varies, but some will range over several kms in search of good foraging opportunities (e.g. Calladine et al. 2006) . Knowledge of husbandry systems and situations, especially for free-range domestic poultry, will be essential for interpreting the most likely associated wild bird species. The regime at a commercial free-range poultry unit involves rotovating and seeding of paddocks following the harvesting of geese and ducks before the next cohort of poultry is introduced. There are fallow periods between cohorts of domestic birds. The wild birds using these areas include migratory species and may use a range of habitats, e.g. gulls (Table 13 .1), including for example movement between wetlands and farmland, which may in fact be in close proximity. Additionally, certain passerine species will enter poultry houses, if they can gain entry, in search of food, water, sheltered roost sites or nesting sites, notably starling Sturnus vulgaris and house sparrow Passer domesticus, which traditionally have a particularly close association with farm buildings. These observations are based on the situation in the UK and are likely to reflect a similar situation elsewhere in northern Europe, although further south and east there are additional species that may associate with these commercial (particularly in the case of free-range) farming systems. Group 3: In those areas where domestic poultry range widely, with no containment (non-commercial poultry), there is great potential for mixing with a wide range of resident wild birds, notably in the vicinity of freshwater wetlands, especially of Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Some of these are given in this Group 3, although this again is not an exhaustive listing. Figure 13 .2 presents the decision tree used to select the bird 'bridge' species. ",

At present, it is not clear whether bridge species have been the means of virus transmission to domestic poultry, although mortality has been recorded in some species of resident wild birds in association with several outbreaks of H5N1 HPAIV in domestic poultry (Kou et al. 2005; Perkins and Swayne 2003) . Neither is it clear whether, if it occurs, such transmission of virus would be via shedding of the virus from infected birds or by mechanical means. Application of the decision criteria specified in Figure 13 .2, results in the three groups of bird \"bridge\" species presented in Table 13 .2. Davidson and Stroud in press) . Figure 11 .12 maps the locations of the very large numbers of wetlands of importance for waterbirds in Europe. Probably some tens of thousands of additional sites exist which also support significant numbers of waterbirds at some stage of their annual cycle. Europe's wetlands are linked both to each other and to similar habitats in Africa and Eurasia by a complex web of migratory movements of waterbirds (e.g. Figure  11 .7). The numbers of species using some of these sites is considerable. For example, the National Park of Do\u00f1ana (RAMSAR, SPA, Biosphere Reserve) in the marsh system of the Guadalquivir, in the south-west part of Spain presents an annual average of about 313.000 of wintering birds of a high diversity (23 species) (Mart\u00ed and del Moral, 2003) . In eastern England, the Wash is a major estuarine system in eastern England that supports c.335,000 waterbirds in the nonbreeding season and is either of national or international importance for 24 waterbird species (Collier et al. 2005 ). Long-term ringing at this site has shown that for (some) waders alone the exchange with other countries is very considerable. At least 41 countries are linked by the movements of 23 wader species (Wash Wader Ringing Group 2004) . The movements of all the waterbird species that use the Wash probably link about 60 countries.",

Given the lack of systematic investigations into transmission dynamics in affected areas, the identification of bird species could not be based on published scientific data, but had to be based on expert opinion instead. The level of uncertainty is therefore high.

            "text": "There is a need to determine whether free-living wild birds, if infected with HPAI, can recover and/or carry the virus asymptomatically. Field studies should be urgently undertaken on the behaviour of birds (e.g. crows, pigeons etc.) that associate with man and may act as a bridge between waterbirds and poultry -with the aim of developing practical guidance on ways and means of reducing this risk. Studies should be urgently undertaken, in particular on some of the species of asymptomatic wild birds that currently seem to be the most important in this regard, so that experimental data can confirm or rule out the role of each individual species as virus carriers over long distances, and determine what the duration of the excretion of the virus is. The role of other, non-avian, bridge species, e.g. cat, fox, rat, dogs and mustelids, at least as mechanical vectors, merits investigation. It is highly desirable that field studies be used to develop practical guidance on ways and means of reducing contact between wild waterbirds and domestic poultry -especially suitable for use in developing countries (village poultry situations). Additional research on long distance migration of healthy birds is necessary to elucidate migratory flyways and staging areas for selected species. It is anticipated that the EURING/Wetlands International study (see Section 11.2) will make a substantial contribution to extending our knowledge of bird migration across Europe. (1), Germany (1) and Italy (6), reported H7 positive samples from wild birds. All viruses were confirmed as LPAI. These complimentary activities have resulted in the detection of a number of viruses in wild bird populations including some with high genetic similarity to newly detected viruses in poultry, including H7N3 in Italy and H7N7 in the Netherlands. Furthermore there is evidence for continued circulation of H5 and H7 viruses in wild Anseriformes thereby presenting a real and current threat for the introduction of viruses to domestic poultry especially those reared in outdoor production systems (Terregino et al. 2005; Munster et al. 2005 To develop this programme further technical advice and some support was also provided to countries bordering the EU including some that have current infection in their poultry population. All laboratory approaches based on validated methodology that are considered appropriate for AI surveillance are detailed in annexes to the previous EU directive (EC 1992) and have been incorporated into the new diagnostic manual that accompanies the newly adopted AI directive (EC 2005c) . However, it must be considered that not all laboratories currently have facilities for use of molecular technology and therefore deploy virus isolation in embryonated fowl's eggs for which methods are well harmonised. The application of molecular diagnostics follows broad general principles but a standardised protocol although recommended in the new diagnostic manual has not been formally adopted. Trials to harmonise such testing and to evaluate local variation are currently in progress under the supervision of the Community Reference Laboratory. Preliminary results were all negative for the detection of H5N1 HPAI in healthy wild bird populations. Although there appears to be an increasing trend it is unclear whether this is due to enhanced surveillance in some countries or as a result of increased prevalence in bird populations including 'spikes' of circulation in wild aquatic species especially ducks. Surveys in wild birds in Northern Europe in 1999 to 2000 identified one H5 virus from a total of 8,500 birds sampled (Fouchier et al., 2003) . This would appear to be lower than perceived prevalence in [2003] [2004] in wild bird populations when fewer birds were sampled but from across a more diverse region of Europe. Surveillance for AIVs at key wetlands where migratory flyways intersect, as well as major spring and autumn staging areas, would seem especially valuable. However, the reliability of the results of the monitoring activity in wild birds must be considered in relation to the sample size. The lack of a systematic approach with respect to temporal, spatial, species selection, location in relation to poultry outbreaks (if occurred), strategic location with respect to the migratory flyways of species of higher probability of being exposed, and diagnostic approaches may render difficulties in drawing firm conclusions.",

Ideally the catching and sampling systems should be harmonised between different sites across EU and beyond to allow meaningful interpretation of the prevalence and temporal patterns of the occurrence of different AI subtypes in specific bird populations. The statistical properties of the sampling schemes need to be considered when interpreting the data. Biases affecting bird selection need to be recorded, and considered in data interpretation. The potential host species of Asian H5N1 HPAI virus are largely unknown, and may be different from the natural hosts of LPAI viruses. Thus, monitoring a wider range of potential host species may be desirable. In addition, the existing surveillance networks should be adapted to include bird species that have the potential to migrate directly from areas where the Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV has been detected in poultry and/or wild birds (see Chapter 13). Surveillance studies should include provision for timely examination of unusual wild bird mortality incidents involving one or more species in a single region or location. This is especially critical for evidence gathering in the context of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV presence in birds in areas that were previously considered to be free of the virus. Appropriate health and safety precautions need to be defined for people collecting samples that may potentially contain zoonotic pathogens. A formal European network for wild bird surveillance should be established to facilitate data collection across member states, enhancement of data analysis to map migratory pathways and to provide a structured uniform programme of targeted surveillance in wild bird populations. Such a programme should also create a web-based system to act as a means of rapid dissemination of surveillance results. In addition, it is recommended to set up a global laboratory network to complement the diagnostic support currently provided by internationally recognized laboratories such as Weybridge (EU) and Padova (OIE).",

The circulation of LPAI in domestic poultry is therefore a risk factor for the emergence of HPAIV strains. However, systematic investigations of domestic poultry with respect to LPAI are scarce. The presence of free-grazing domestic ducks was identified to be a risk factor for the occurrence of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV in domestic poultry in Thailand (Gilbert et al. 2006 ). This risk factor was associated with the presence of wetlands used for rice production, where the virus may be able to persist, but where there also is an interface with wild birds. There is only one report of a systematic investigation of the prevalence of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV in domestic geese and ducks demonstrating a low infection level, but higher than in other domestic poultry. Seasonal patterns of virus isolation were observed in southern China. However, due to the lack of formal epidemiological investigations, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that factors not related to climate may have given rise to seasonal variability.",

Also, it is not clear which species can act as reservoirs of the virus, i.e. perpetuate Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV over some time, and lead to exposure of other wild and/or domestic birds. There is anecdotal evidence that this may have occurred in a population of mute swans (Cygnus olor) in Poland (Polish CVO -Report on Actvities -File GIWz 400-258/06 of May 6 2006) .

            "text": "Interpretation of data The probability of exposure of wild birds through infected domestic poultry depends on the management practices in the poultry industry of the region. In many regions affected by Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV, significant numbers of chickens are raised at smallholder level in small flocks and free-range husbandry conditions. In South-East and East Asia these husbandry systems (FAO poultry productions sectors 3 and 4) also include domestic ducks and geese. These species are grazed on paddy fields where they have increased risk of contact with wild waterbirds. Data regarding the spatial distribution of poultry farm types are not available for China. Data on poultry production in Africa are scarce and not available at a detailed level. The probability is very high (low uncertainty) that poultry husbandry systems used in most low-income countries will contaminate the environment with Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV after outbreaks in domestic poultry and there is likely to be direct or indirect contact between domestic and wild birds. Particularly, free-grazing duck production systems allow for extensive direct and indirect contact between domestic ducks and wild waterbirds. Specifically domestic ducks may act as local reservoirs of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV from where the virus spills over into wild bird populations. Indirect transmission of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV primarily depends on the environmental stability of the virus. Specific experiments regarding the stability of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV are scarce. Other AI viruses retain infectivity at room temperature from at least several days up to several weeks. Stability is extended at temperatures <20\u00baC. Infectivity is retained in fresh surface water for several days. The survival of HPAI virus in salt water, soil and aerosols is not known. Given the physical and chemical composition of AIV particles, aerosol transmission between chicken and wild birds are considered possible, but there is currently only evidence which suggests that this transmission mechanism is less important than the faecal-oral route (Defra 2005) .",

In the field, Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV was isolated predominantly from dead wild birds. More systematic sampling of healthy birds, however, was shown to lead to the isolation of the virus. Factors that may influence the pathogenicity in wild birds include: virus strain, species of bird, age of bird, infection dose. However, these factors have not yet been investigated systematically. There is some evidence related to LPAI that juvenile birds may exhibit an increased incidence of infection (EFSA 2005) . Empirical data recently reported from several regions suggest an increased pathogenicity in mute swans (Cygnus olor). On the other hand, certain species, e.g. pigeons (Colombia livia), have been shown experimentally to have very low susceptibility to HPAIV. However, there has been reported evidence of field infection causing mortality (EFSA, 2005) . In general, species-specific data on pathogenicity are lacking. Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV field isolates were shown to be a heterogeneous mixture of different pathotypes. Molecular determinants distinguishing between these different pathogenicity profiles in birds have not yet been identified. It is well documented that some species of the Orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes can act as reservoirs of LPAI viruses (Kaleta et al. 2005) . Little is known, however, about the level of protection and longevity of specific immune response induced by LPAI virus. The prevalence of AI subtypes in wild ducks may be up to 60%. Partial humoral immunity against H5 in addition to cellular immunity could lead to an attenuated course of infection after exposure to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV, but is unlikely to prevent infection (i.e. sufficient immunity to prevent disease). This may indicate an increased probability of low pathogenicity of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV in these Orders of bird species.",

            "text": "Interpretation of data Survival of wild birds after experimental infection was documented in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) for 10-17 days Chen et al. 2006) . The amount of virus excreted and the duration of excretion was reduced for strains which exhibited low pathogenicity to ducks although retaining high pathogencity to chickens. In these experiments, some birds remained clinically healthy and surviving animals shed virus for up to 17 days post inoculation. Data on survival of wild birds after natural infection are not available, except for some anecdotal evidence about infected apparently healthy swans in Poland. However, based on molecular analyses of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV isolated from migratory birds in different regions of China and based on the chronological sequence of these isolations, it is possible that infected animals may migrate over considerable distances ). The fact that most isolates of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV from wild birds originated from individual birds that were found dead may be due to a high mortality caused in certain species, but it may also be due to sampling bias as dead birds are more accessible to sampling. Extensive surveillance of healthy migratory ducks in southern China provided both antigenic and serologic evidence of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV circulation . Extensive investigations in Russia led to the isolation of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV from both healthy and sick or dead water birds. Outbreaks of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV in wild birds were associated with high mortality in some wild bird populations, e.g. bar-headed geese Anser indicus at Lake Qinghaihu, China, 2005. This confirms a large variability of pathogenicity, the influential factors of which are largely unknown. The analysis of the virus recently detected in dead wild birds in European countries showed very high similarity between the isolates (Brown et al 2006 [abstract] ). This may indicate an adaptation of a distinct sublineage of the Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV to wild birds, i.e. the H5N1 Z genotype. A possible scenario for birds infected with Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV to reach mixing and concentration areas is by relay transmission, i.e. when infected birds -before they die -pass on virus to other birds who then in turn continue migration. Whether infected birds will migrate normally is unknown. However, it seems likely that at least some birds infected with Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV will reach mixing and concentration areas even if infected birds do not migrate normally. Data on mixing and concentration areas are based on count data which are available over large geographical areas but vary spatially and temporally. Data on bird movements are generally based on re-sightings of individually ringed birds. Because continuing and systematic analysis of ringing data at international scales is lacking, maps of migration systems for individual species are either lacking or frequently based on outdated data. Additionally, migration patterns of birds are highly variable and influenced by species, age, sex, season and weather. Nevertheless, major flyways of birds, specifically ducks, geese, swans and waders have been described. For nearly all species, these maps are, however, not accurate enough to reliably predict the presence of certain species of specific origin on selected routes or sites. For some well-studied goose populations there is greater understanding of detailed spatial and temporal patterns of movement. They only allow for rough spatial and temporal descriptions of bird movements at a very general level. These general flyways show that currently infected areas in south-east Asia and Africa are covered by major flyways of waterbirds.",

Both sources are incomplete and the quality of data varies considerably between sites, countries and count years. The number of birds present at any one site is influenced by weather conditions (cold, drought) and disturbance caused by human activities, as well as by time of year. Some important mixing and concentration areas where several flyways converge, specifically of some species of Anatidae can be identified, e.g. the region encompassing the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Migratory flights larger than 5,000 km between South Europe and Asia, across Central Asia and Caspian Sea, as it has been confirmed for some wild bird species (Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2006, in press) , suggest the possibility of interchange, in some important mixing and concentration areas, between the populations from Europe and those from Asia (East, South and Central) by direct migration, misorientation or abmigration. These factors could contribute to the propagation of H5N1 HPAIV to currently virus-free areas. These are also areas where there is potential mixing of poultry with wild birds and shared habitats. Comments made on migration patterns and their variability in Section 16.3 are equally applicable here. By definition, mixing and concentration areas are those sites where large numbers of different wild bird species congregate for a variable time periods. The assessment of the number of species present at mixing and concentration areas, as well as the origins and destinations of birds using these sites, is based on data collected by IWC and EURING. These data are currently being analysed. At present, there is limited ability to identify all mixing and concentration areas used by specific bird species from a given flyway (i.e. for most species it is not possible to say that an individual bird using a flyway from A to B, uses sites C, D, E etc. -we do not know routes used except for a small number of species). The density of birds at mixing and concentration areas enhances the probability of transmission both by direct and indirect pathways. Excretion of virus in experimentally infected mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) was consistently shown to last up to 17 days post infection . Data on excretion in other wild bird species are scarce. Excretion dose in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) was assessed in only few experiments and reached 10 4 -10 5.7 EID 50 /ml. Such virus concentrations reliably led to infection under experimental conditions. Rapid transmission of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV within wild bird populations was confirmed during outbreaks in Hong Kong in 2002 where the incidence in certain species was >80% . A high occurrence of infection was also found in recently observed outbreaks of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV in Germany. The data by Globig et al. (2006) supports the hypothesis of significant levels of AIV transmission occurring for European migrating duck species at breeding grounds in the Northern part of Europe and Asia. It is of interest that during that particular 2-year study, no AIV were identified in ducks during periods of the year other than autumn/early winter, in mostly resident species (330 geese and 255 swans), or in migrating waders.",

Situations where there is a limited or no mixing would reduce the probability of exposure to a negligible level. Gregariousness of a bird species is thought to be directly related to the probability of exposure to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV because the probability of cross infection increases with the number and density of birds in any areas. Birds living solitarily or in small groups (few tens of birds) resulting in low density of birds (>5 m between individuals) are thought to exhibit negligible probability of exposure. The habitat used by a bird species (during migration and wintering or breeding) is anticipated to affect the probability of exposure to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV with birds preferring marine and/or littoral habitats experiencing negligible probability of exposure. Both water chemistry and temperature influence the survival of the virus. Global infection status in relation to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV: the situation in winter and spring 2005/2006 is highly dynamic. The global distribution of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV alters the probability of virus circulation along flyways and at certain mixing and concentration areas.

Species that are very common are presumed to have a higher risk (notably if they are susceptible) as a function of the greater numbers of individuals. Using these criteria, a decision tree for identifying migratory bird species with an increased probability of carrying Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV to the EU was developed based on data available in April 2006. Due to the dynamic situation at the time of writing, the factor \"migration through infected area\" was not applied. Factors \"susceptibility\", \"gregariousness\" and \"mixing\" were already considered in Chapter 16. Applying this approach, a list of wild bird species of higher significance in terms of transmission of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV was obtained (Table 16 .2, summary based on Table 11 .2). This list needs to be updated when new data related to any of the factors listed above become available. The list is not a closed list and should be regularly updated. It can be used as a framework for targeting surveillance efforts in migratory birds. It is emphasised that population size is another influential parameter for species prioritisation, which must be applied according to the regional situation. Hinshaw et al. 1980 ) and that there is a peak of viral shedding activity in the autumn (Stallknecht et al. 1990a; De Marco et al. 2005) . Given that flocks migrating in autumn will contain a significant proportion of juvenile birds (for arctic breeding species this proportion is variable according to the conditions during that year in the breeding areas), this suggests that the autumn migration period is of higher risk than spring migration. Although migration activities are highly variable between and within bird species, general peaks of movements can be identified in autumn and in spring. Bird numbers during autumn migration from breeding sites to wintering areas tend to be higher and the proportion of young birds is higher. In autumn, migration movements tend to be spread over a longer time period and they are highly dependent on temperature conditions. In spring, migration back to the breeding sites tend to be more concentrated with fewer birds moving over a shorter time period (most notably for birds breeding at northern latitudes where the breeding season is short due to weather conditions). Further peaks of movement may occur in winter as a result of cold weather movements; the extent and timing of such movements are entirely dependent on weather conditions. EU member states are situated over a large geographical area. The presence of migratory species at a given point in time is therefore variable between countries. No general statement can be made that is valid for all countries in terms of the probability of introduction of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV by species and season. Based on available data, it is not possible to accurately predict the time and location of the introduction of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV. However, an introduction via migratory waterbirds appears to be the most likely scenario if the virus was introduced by wild birds. Since the time when this assessment was performed (April 2006) , this event has already happened.",

The release assessment includes the estimation of the probability for this entire process. It considers how it can be affected by various factors including risk management measures. The resulting conditional probability of release of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV into the EU through wild birds which became infected outside the EU is medium (high uncertainty) (Table 16 .3). Using the interpretation given in Table 3 .1, this means that Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV can be expected to be released into the EU by migratory birds as a regular event (as distinct from rare or very often). It should be noted that this qualitative probability estimate is associated with a high level of uncertainty. It is particularly high as a result of the apparent variation of the pathogenicity of the virus in different species and their potential survival. There are a large number of species that are potentially affected but only one (Mallard Anas platyrhynchos) has been tested experimentally. This uncertainty affects both the migration to and from mixing and concentration areas. The probability of detection of infection in wild birds at mixing and concentration areas is extremely dependent on the level and type of surveillance, which is not standardised between countries. In contrast to the Panel's majority opinion, it was felt that the available data does not provide justification to specify a low or high risk for any of the migratory species considered here. By adopting these, risk managers are provided with two conclusions that are more weighted towards the ends of the probability spectrum than can be supported by the data.

Surveillance methods to be investigated should include sampling of live (capture/release and hunted sample) and dead birds. Practical methods for monitoring population sizes need to be developed so that more reliable prevalence estimates can be obtained. Virological studies need to be conducted to determine the amount or level of virus in sampled material. Existing ringing and count data for wild birds needs to be analysed to elucidate migration routes and networks of sites used by birds migrating to or through Europe and or outbreak areas outside the EU. Existing surveillance data should be examined to identify gaps in information which then should be addressed by specific research activities. Poultry husbandry needs to be described in geographical areas where such information currently is deficient. The risk and the specific mechanisms of indirect or direct transmission of virus between wild birds and domestic poultry need to be investigated. Presence of susceptible non-migratory wild birds in EU Considering the conclusions drawn under 16.2.2 and the abundance and variety of wild birds in Europe, including species of documented susceptibility such as mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and mute swans (Cygnus olor), the probability of susceptible non-migratory bird species being present is very high (medium uncertainty), at least in some regions. However, systematic data on susceptibility differences between species are not available. Investigations conducted in Europe (Fouchier et al. 2003) documented isolations predominantly of low pathogenic AI virus from ducks, geese and gulls. Regional differences in the abundance of susceptible species are expected as a consequence of their distribution and habitats. If common species such as sparrows are confirmed to be susceptible (Kou et al. 2005) , the geographical differences may become less distinct. In early 2006, Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV was isolated repeatedly from wild birds in several European countries. Mute swans (Cygnus olor) were frequently overrepresented in these outbreaks which may indicate an increased pathogenicity of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV in these birds, or sampling bias owing to their high visibility and frequent association with habitats close to human habitation.",

Based on available data, it is not possible to predict the most likely scenario. Considering the abundance and wide distribution of waterbirds and the inter-connection of wetlands, the probability of direct exposure of at least some non-migratory bird species to wild migratory birds is very high and so their potential exposure to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV carried by migratory birds is high (medium uncertainty), particularly if these non-migratory birds are waterbirds.

The goal of surveillance activities is early detection of the introduction of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV. Samples positive for Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV predominantly originated from dead birds. An increasing number of such positive samples were detected in early 2006. Whether this is due to an increased prevalence of virus or due to increased awareness and surveillance activities cannot be determined, although there has been an increase in surveillance activity by MS since the mandatory requirement was implemented. At present, the probability of detection of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV infection in wild birds is medium to high (high uncertainty) if the virus causes mortality (or sickness), if large and highly visible birds are affected and if the outbreak occurs in an area that is frequented by humans. In a scenario where the virus causes no clinical signs or if only birds in a remote area or small or less visible birds are affected, the probability of detection is low (low uncertainty).

Factors influencing the probability of exposure relating to infected migratory birds Influential factors with respect to the probability of exposure of domestic poultry are: Wild bird species carrying the virus, number of wild birds infected, time and location of introduction. A possible scenario will be that Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV is introduced into Europe via migrating waterbirds. It might then be transmitted to non-migratory waterbirds and/or to domestic poultry. The decision tree used to define the migratory wild bird species more likely to release Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV produced a list species shown in (Table 16 .2). This list was further refined using expert opinion to identify those migratory wild bird species which also are more likely to come into contact with domestic poultry (see Table 18 .2, summary based on Table 13 .1). EU Member States are situated over a large geographical area with diverse climate and habitats. The presence of migratory bird species at a given point in time is therefore variable between and within countries. No general statement can be made that is valid for all countries in terms of the probability of direct exposure of poultry to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV from wild birds. Factors influencing the probability of exposure relating to nonmigratory birds The probability of poultry exposure to non-migratory infected birds is influenced by the species of birds infected, the number of infected birds, the clinical signs in these birds and the contact between domestic and wild birds. Additionally, non-migratory bird species were identified that could act as bridge species (Table 18 .3, summary based on Table 13 .2). Bridge species were defined as birds that live in close proximity to domestic poultry -perhaps sharing buildings or food sources. The list is not a closed list and should be regularly updated. It can be used as the basis for targeting surveillance efforts in wild birds. EU Member States are situated over a large geographical area with diverse climate and habitats. The presence of wild bird species at a given point in time is therefore variable between and within countries. No general statement can be made that is valid for all countries in terms of the probability of exposure of poultry to Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV from wild birds. Factors influencing the probability of indirect exposure of poultry Indirect exposure of poultry is higher than negligible if surface water is used to which migratory or non-migratory infected birds have also access. The probability of indirect transmission of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV via contaminated forage or soil is unknown. In general, the probability of indirect exposure is most strongly influenced by the type of poultry production system (e.g. free-range production) and the related biosecurity measures (EFSA 2005) . Data from an outbreak in a UK quarantine facility suggests that aerosol transmission of infection from infected wild birds to chickens kept within the same airspace represents a very low risk. Infected predator species could become infected by consumption of infected wild bird carcasses. If they have access to poultry populations kept under low biosecurity, they could expose poultry to infection.",

            "text": "Seasonal migration is the annual movement between breeding areas and those areas, typically more southerly, that are used at other times of the year. Northwards movements peak in spring (the return to breeding grounds) and autumn (post-breeding migration to wintering areas). The exact timing and stopover sites used vary between species, although often broad migration flyways are recognised. Within these broad flyways, there may be differences in the routes taken in autumn and spring (loop-migration). Leap-frog migration entails the overflight of more southerly breeding populations by more northerly breeding populations to reach their wintering grounds. In some cases there may be a body size difference linked to the different latitudes at which breeding occurs. This is well-illustrated by the Redshank in that the Icelandic race Tringa totanus robusta which winters furthest north in northwestern Europe is larger than the race that breeds in northern Fennoscandia T. t. totanus, but occupies the most southerly wintering grounds extending to west Africa (Clark in Wernham et al. 2002 ; Figure 23 .1). Among migratory species there are different strategies, geese and swans usually migrate from their breeding grounds as family groups and remain together on the wintering grounds. In most waders (shorebirds), adults migrate before juveniles and there are differences in the timing of migration by the adult male and adult female, one of the pair remaining to care for dependent chicks (this parental care is undertaken by the male in some and by the female in other wader species). Migration to breeding areas is often highly synchronised, especially in those species which breed in the high arctic, where the short breeding season makes time a critical commodity. The return migration to wintering grounds is staggered, with failed breeders often leaving early, whilst recently fledged juveniles leave later than breeding adults, for example in the case of shorebirds. Juvenile dispersal often entails, what are considered to be, exploratory flights by young birds, providing them with information that will enhance their future survival and productivity. Furthermore, immature birds may remain on the wintering grounds during the breeding season, or migrate to intermediate sites along the flyway, not returning to the breeding areas until ready to breed. In waterbirds, it takes several years for birds to reach breeding maturity, for example up to five or more years in the Greenland White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons flavirostris. There may be only a very short period of time at the wintering locations when migratory birds are absent or occur in very low numbers. Although interchange between sites occurs, there is a high degree of site fidelity to wintering and breeding areas in particular, by many species, once young birds have selected a site. Migration flights may be on a broad front, with many parallel migration streams over a large geographical area, as is generally considered to be the case for passerines. For large, soaring species in particular, migratory bottlenecks occur, narrow corridors where birds concentrate to take advantage of a short sea crossing or mountain pass to facilitate crossing a physical barrier along their route. Migration may be undertaken in a single flight, or a series of flights, with stopover sites along the way used to refuel. The strategy used depends on the distance, species and ability to carry fat reserves to fuel flight.",

During the annual moult of the wing feathers, these species become flightless and so more vulnerable to predation, necessitating a safe moulting site and rich food supply. Typically, these are either at higher latitudes, or sometimes higher altitudes. Cold-weather movements are triggered by cold weather, for example freezing conditions that make food incessible, as birds move in search of less severe conditions (Ridgill and Fox 1990) . Several species, notably wildfowl and shorebirds, that are noted for making cold weather movements, for example Eurasian Wigeon Anas penelope, Common Teal Anas crecca, Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula and Northern Lapwing. Such movements are entirely dependent on periods of severe weather to trigger them and so, although associated with winter, the precise timing and frequency in any one winter varies. Cold weather movements are characterised by influxes of large numbers of birds to milder climes (e.g. Figure 23 .3). Figure 23 .4 shows those European regions (50 x 50 km squares) that showed net influxes of nine species of waterbirds in severe cold winters (Ridgill and Fox 1990) .

Annex 5 -Information on population sizes and distribution of migratory species currently more likely to expose poultry in the EU to H5N1 HPAIV A wide range of information exists on the population sizes and distributions of European birds. Distributions of all European breeding bird species are mapped by Hagemeijer and Blair (1997) , whilst Snow and Perrins (1998) present maps showing year-round distributions of all species. For Anatidae, Scott and Rose (1996) show breeding and non-breeding distributions together with key sites. More detailed data and information are presented for each European goose population by Madsen et al. (1999) . Population data are tabulated by country for all European bird species by , updated by BirdLife International (2004). Detailed information on the population sizes (by country) of wader populations in Africa and Western Eurasia is given by Stroud et al. (2004) , whilst Thorup (2005) presents updated population estimates for some European breeding waders. Most recent information on the sizes of biogeographic (international) population sizes of waterbirds is collated by Wetlands International and published in Waterbird Population Estimates (most recently in Wetlands International 2002). Sources of information on key sites for species more likely to expose poultry in the EU to H5N1 HPAIV Heath and Evans (2000) presented summary information on all Important Bird Areas in Europe with listings of the major species occurring on each site (see also section 11.2 on concentration and mixing areas). Most European countries publish periodic (often annual) summaries of national waterbird monitoring schemes. These typically summarise important sites for each waterbird species. Most recent national sources of data and information are given in Wernham et al. 2002 EURING is an international federation of European national ringing schemes. It established and continues to harmonise the standards for national ringing schemes in order to aid the ready exchange and analyses of bird ringing data at European scale. It maintains a database of all European bird ringing recoveries, which is currently hosted by the British Trust for Ornithology. The European Commission (DG Environment) has contracted to EURING the analysis of data holdings so as to provide information related to the movements of species more likely to expose poultry in the EU to H5N1 HPAIV. These analyses will be published in spring 2006 and the current document could then be updated. Bairlein et al. (2002 ) updating Fiedler 1998 Smit and Piersma (1998) . Figure 11 .5.

Specifically, work commissioned by DG Environment and conducted by Wetlands International and EURING was published in an extensive report (Delany et al., 2006) . The report contains relevant information which previously had been unavailable and which allows for more specific recommendations on surveillance. Further work was conducted by various groups in relation to susceptibility and pathogenicity of HPAI Asian lineage H5N1 in selected wild bird species. Also, diagnostic sampling was conducted in healthy wild birds during summer and data on cases in wild birds from last winter are being analysed. Only part of the results from these investigations have so far been published. It is expected that additional relevant information will become available in the coming months. In addition, further research has been commissioned in response to the call issued by DG Research. In October 2006, a total of \u20ac28.3 million was allocated to 17 new research projects into avian and pandemic influenza (http://ec.europa.eu/research /press/2006 /pr1710en.cfm). The projects cover human and animal health and address research needs identified by organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the World Organisation for Animal Health, and the UN Food & Agriculture Organisation. The projects addressing animal health will cover vaccines, better diagnosis and early warning systems, increased knowledge of the avian influenza virus, technology transfer to third countries, and a network for monitoring migratory birds 1 .",

            "text": "Update on diagnostic approach for the detection of Asian Lineage H5N1 HPAIV in Wild Bird Populations New and relevant data In 2006, several EU member states have reported the detection of Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV in wild birds. In most instances, numerous organs were collected from dead birds and tested for H5N1 virus using the diagnostic methods described in the Scientific Report (EFSA-Q-2005-243) . From these analyses it was concluded that the H5N1 virus was frequently detected in tissues of the respiratory tract. In addition, oropharyngeal swabs were found to be a reliable indicator for the presence of H5N1 virus in wild birds (Harder unpublished data). To reduce the workload in the laboratories and to enable the screening of larger numbers of dead wild birds, several laboratories used oropharyngeal swab testing as the primary diagnostic test following the initial investigations on multiple organs. Tissues containing high viral loads were found in the lung and in the central nervous system correlating also with immunohistochemical investigations in diseased wild swans (Teifke et al., unpublished data) . Experimental infections of several species of ducks belonging to the Anas and Aythya genera have been performed (Fouchier unpublished data) . Under these experimental conditions, the Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV (A/Turkey/Turkey/1/05) was detected primarily in pharyngeal swabs, and rarely in cloacal swabs. Virus shedding from the respiratory tract occurred for 2-6 days at titres of 10 3.5 to 10 6.2 TCID50. In contrast, virus shedding from the digestive tract occurred only for 1 or 2 days, only in very few animals, and at titres of 10 2.2 to 10 3.2 TCID50. None of 32 ducks belonging to 4 Anas species (A. platyrhynchos, A. penelope, A. strepera, A. crecca) developed clinical signs whereas 3/7 Pochards (Aythya ferina) and 4/7 Tufted ducks (Aythya fuligula) displayed reduced activity. In addition, 1/7 of these Pochards and 3/7 Tufted ducks were moribund or died. Similar data were obtained by using North American ducks and laughing gulls infected with influenza viruses A/Whooper Swan/Mongolia/244/05 and A/Duck meat/Anyang/01, although these viruses were detected in cloacal swabs more frequently than in the Dutch study. Whereas Blue-winged teals (Anas discors), Redhead ducks (Aythya americana), Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Northern Pintails (Anas acuta) did not show signs of disease, whereas Wood ducks (Aix sponsa) and Laughing gulls (Larus atricilla) did (4/6 and 6/6 respectively) and a large proportion of the animals died from the infection (3/6 and 4/6 respectively). In experimentally infected birds, the brain, lung, and kidney were positive for influenza virus most frequently and generally had the highest virus load . Despite the intense EU-wide surveillance efforts aimed at detecting Asian lineage H5N1 HPAIV in wild migrating birds, the virus has not been detected in live birds areas distant from where the virus was found in dead birds. Because it is possible that the testing of cloacal swabs alone is not sufficient to detect the H5N1 virus, no firm conclusions can be drawn about potentially infected species. While serological testing in general provides a relatively simple opportunity to estimate the prevalence of pathogens in host populations, serological surveys for the presence of Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 virus in wild birds have not been conducted. The primary reason is that serological assays that can discriminate between birds exposed to LPAI (H5) viruses and birds exposed to the Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 virus are not yet available. Recently, it has become clear that the antigenic properties of Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 viruses are changing rapidly (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/guidelines/recommendationv accine.pdf). It is possible that, based on the differences in antigenic properties between LPAI and Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 viruses, serological tests can be designed that will be useful for serological surveys in wild birds. Such studies would then allow the rapid identification of previously exposed wild bird populations and subsequent intensified targeting of these populations in virus surveillance studies. These studies should be conducted by reference laboratories that have extensive experience in the use of serology for influenza virus.",

Herbivorous species such as Moorhen (Gallinula gallinula) and Coot are potentially likely to have high contact rates with poultry but have not formally been assessed through the filter process set-out in either the EFSA or DG Environment reports. \u2022 Field studies should be urgently undertaken on the behaviour of so-called bridge-species (e.g. sparrows, starlings, crows, pigeons etc. [see chapter 13 of original opinion]) that associate with man and may act as a bridge between waterbirds and poultry. This should include consideration of bird behaviour with the aim of developing practical guidance on ways and means of reducing this risk. Such work should also analyse data for such species from outbreaks and surveillance in 2005 and 2006 to help understand the r\u00f4le of bridge species as local vectors of avian influenza viruses. \u2022 In the event of future outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 it will be important to assess the infection status of potential bridge species to better understand their actual or potential r\u00f4le as local vectors of avian influenza viruses.",

As well as summarising and analysing results by species, this should attempt to summarise sampling effort by location and thus (to the extent possible) against the different biogeographical populations of the waterbirds concerned, and thus the different flyways used by these populations. \u2022 Given the expressed desire of the EU to establish 'early warning systems', future analysis and reporting of AIV surveillance data needs to be much more rapid and responsive, as previously recommended, the current development of on-line systems of data-capture and reporting of AI surveillance results by the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) is a welcome development. It is important that this work is completed by the CRL's and implemented by EU Member States as soon as possible. \u2022 The critical importance of correct identification of sampled birds to at least the relevant species continues to require strong reinforcement with Member State authorities responsible for AIV surveillance, as does the value of collecting ancillary data such as that related to age and sex of the birds so as better to develop an understanding of the apparently unique epidemiology of Asian lineage HPAI H5N1. To this end, we recommend that close cooperation between the national veterinary authorities and non-governmental organisations with specialist ornithological expertise should continue to be strongly encouraged. \u2022 It is highly desirable to better develop wider international perspectives in the collection and analysis of data on avian influenza viruses along migratory flyways, especially in those areas from where birds will migrate into the European Union. To this end, the development of the Global Network for Avian Influenza Surveillance (GAINS) as an international initiative (and NEWFLUBIRD in western Eurasia and Africa as a possible regional component of GAINS) should be encouraged. \u2022 The information provided in Delaney et al. (2006) provides a summary of extensive data-holdings and should be used by Member States to develop better targeted (risk-based) surveillance programmes. \u2022 Whilst there is now a clear understanding of the distribution of higher-risk waterbirds in Europe, further work is desirable to overlay this information on main centres of poultry production as an important next step in European risk assessment. Work by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), presented at the British Ornithologists' Union (BOU) conference on bird diseases (20 & 21 Nov 2006, Peterborough) , provides one approach, albeit considering a larger suite of wild birds than just waterbirds, for the UK. We recommend that these guidelines be reviewed in the light of the recommendations of this addendum, in particular the need for more coordinated and strategic approaches at a European scale. We envisage that this will require co-ordinated approaches between neighbouring Member States, especially those located on similar flyways, in particular to produce regional samples, as outlined in section 3.1.",

There is an increasing body of evidence showing that H5N1 HPAIV can be carried without clinical signs by several species of wild birds (ducks, sparrows, swans, etc).

RecommendationsThere is a need of setting up of a European database with relevant data on migratory wild birds. Such a database should include information on the number and the location of infected birds. Passive and active surveillance amongst wild bird populations within the EU should be intensified. Biosecurity measures for all types of poultry holding need to be reviewed, according to EFSA previous opinion (www.efsa.eu.int). In particular \u2022 Staff hygiene should be assessed where there is a risk of staff contact with waterfowl or other infected animals. \u2022 Building access for wild birds or other infected animals needs to be prevented. \u2022 Use of water and feed that may be contaminanted by infected birds needs to be prevented. \u2022 Since the risk of infection in the vicinity of migratory waterfowl refuges may be higher than in other locations, it would be better to avoid locating poultry units to be set up newly near to such refuges. For existing production units located in such areas, biosecurity measures need to be strengthened and compliance may need to be audited. \u2022 In geographical areas where HPAI infection is likely to pose a risk to domestic poultry, these birds should not be kept outside. \u2022 If there is an outbreak of HPAI in wild birds, game birds and ducks should not be released to the wild during the risk periods, particularly if this is done in large numbers and the birds are attracted to return by being fed subsequently. \u2022 If there is an outbreak of HPAI in wild birds, the general public should not conduct hunting or collect wild waterfowl themselves by some other method (note that they should still be encouraged to report finding dead birds), and the public should be encouraged to take basic hygiene precautions when visiting the vicinity of outbreak areas.Recommendations for future researchAt a national level, those species of wild birds should be identified that are most closely associated with poultry holdings, of all management types, and this information should be used to review and, if necessary, revise biosecurity measures. Research on vaccination stated in the previous EFSA scientific opinion on AI, should be already taken into consideration (www.efsa.eu.int). EC, 1979.

Even if there is no visible sign of faeces, the sample may contain sufficient material for analysis. The swab is then inserted into a vial of storage media and broken just above the cotton tip; this can be done easily by bending (plastic swab) or using scissors (metal swab). The vial with the cotton tip can now be closed properly, and labelled. Alternatively, faecal samples may be used for diagnostics if it is impossible or difficult to collect cloacal swabs. For liquid faeces from birds (e.g. from gulls) a cotton swab may be used to transfer faeces to the vials, and the tip of the cotton swab broken off as described above. For more solid faeces (e.g. from geese) it may be more convenient to transfer a piece of faeces using the tube and the lid itself. The swabs should be stored in appropriate storage media (e.g. Hanks balanced salt solution containing 10% glycerol, 200 U/ml penicillin, 200 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml polymyxin B sulfate, and 250 mg/ml gentamycin and immediately after collection stored at -70 o C. An unbroken cold chain from the sampling site to the laboratory is important. If this is not possible, storage at +4 C for a few days is acceptable. Repeated freeze-thawing must be avoided.Annex 4 -Explanation of data fields used in Annex 2 spreadsheetOrder Taxonomic Order within which the species occurs.",

Thus a scenario where small numbers of wild birds are potentially in contact with poultry for a long period is considered equivalent to a scenario where larger numbers are in contact for a shorter period.

Responses were consolidated with those of this Working Group's ornithologists to produce a final evaluation.Species defined as \"higher risk\" in Commission Decision 2005-726 Species which were included in a preliminary list of \"higher risk species\" for Europe, related to the outbreak areas in SW Siberia, Northern Kazakhstan and the area south of the Urals, in September 2005 and which were adopted by the European Commission(Decision 2005-726).",
