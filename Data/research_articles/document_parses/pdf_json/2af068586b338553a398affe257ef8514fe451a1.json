More than three-quarters of the world's nations and territories have been affected, and cases are being found in previously unaffected areas each day [1]. At the time of writing, there were 7,039,918 confirmed cases worldwide, and 404,396 deaths [1]; these numbers are expected to grow in the coming months. Although data surrounding the novel coronavirus are rapidly evolving, initial estimates depict a dire situation: 20% of infections lead to severe or critical disease [2] . Mortality has varied across settings, but early data suggest a case fatality rate near 4% [4, 5] .",

We have already started the process to build a new Severity Scoring Tool using verifiable data from a smaller, reputable source. The derivation and validation process are likely to take several months to complete. In the meantime, AFEM would like to signpost to the open access, interim WHO Clinical management of COVID-19 guidelines. This document provides direction on the urgent management of acute respiratory distress in adult patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Practical and realistic strategies are presented for the care of patients of all severity levels, with the assumption that there is no easy access to more advanced testing such as troponin or CT scan.",
