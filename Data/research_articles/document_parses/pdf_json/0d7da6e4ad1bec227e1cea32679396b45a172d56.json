They carry viruses that may evolve and become highly pathogenic for poultry or zoonotic. Understanding the ecology of LPAIVs in these natural hosts is therefore essential. We assessed the clinical response, viral shedding and antibody production of juvenile mallards after intra-esophageal inoculation of two LPAIV subtypes previously isolated from wild congeners. Six ducks, equipped with data loggers that continually monitored body temperature, heart rate and activity, were successively inoculated with an H7N7 LPAI isolate (day 0), the same H7N7 isolate again (day 21) and an H5N2 LPAI isolate (day 35). After the first H7N7 inoculation, the ducks remained alert with no modification of heart rate or activity. However, body temperature transiently increased in four individuals, suggesting that LPAIV strains may have minor clinical effects on their natural hosts. The excretion patterns observed after both reinoculations differed strongly from those observed after the primary H7N7 inoculation, suggesting that not only homosubtypic but also heterosubtypic immunity exist. Our study suggests that LPAI infection has minor clinically measurable effects on mallards and that mallard ducks are able to mount immunological responses protective against heterologous infections. Because the transmission dynamics of LPAIVs in wild populations is greatly influenced by individual susceptibility and herd immunity, these findings are of high importance.

Their classification relies on two antigenic surface proteins, the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) for which 16 and 9 different subtypes are known, respectively. Because many combinations of HA and NA have been found in wild waterfowl and the prevalence in these species is high worldwide, they are considered the natural reservoir of IAVs [1] . Prevalence is particularly high in dabbling ducks (i.e. ducks that feed by tipping into the water to graze on aquatic vegetation or feed on small aquatic preys), probably because their feeding behavior favors ingestion of viral particles. In ducks, IAVs usually replicate in the epithelial cells of the intestinal tract and are excreted at high concentrations from the cloaca into water [2] [3] [4] . The main transmission route in waterfowl is oro-fecal [5] but indirect contamination by ingestion of contaminated water may also play a role in yearly infection dynamics [6] .
