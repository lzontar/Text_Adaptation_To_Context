Most individuals infected have mild-tomoderate disease manifestations. However, a substantial subset of infected adults, and some children, have more severe disease needing hospitalization, with some critically ill, requiring mechanical ventilation, circulatory support, and in some instances extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [1] . The reported case fatality rates in adults are variable, with the true value estimated to be 0.2 to 3% [2, 3] , with increased mortality risk associated with older age and chronic underlying medical conditions [1] . There is a clear need for treatment options for adults with COVID-19 and both pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis in exposed adult contacts. Clinical trials for adults have been rapidly designed, are being implemented across the globe, and will provide high-quality evidence to inform treatment and prevention approaches [4] .",

Children <1 year of age had a higher risk of severe or critical disease (10.6%) compared to children of older ages (ranging from 3.0 to 7.3%). Only one child, a 14-year-old male, died. In another cohort of 171 children with confirmed SARS CoV-2 from China, 4 (2.3%) children had oxygen saturations <92% and 3 (1.8%) required intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation, one of whom died [9] . A preliminary report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control describes comparable disease characteristics in 2,572 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children <18 years of age [10] . Of all pediatric cases reported, A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5.7% were hospitalized, although for many, the hospitalization status was not reported. Of 745 pediatric cases with known hospitalization status, 145 (20%) were hospitalized, including 15 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Many, but not all, had some underlying co-morbidity, including chronic lung disease, immunosuppression or cardiovascular disease. Of the 95 children <1 year of age with known hospitalization status, 59 (62%) were hospitalized including five admitted to the ICU. Three deaths were reported; whether the underlying cause of death in these cases was COVID-19 was not confirmed.",

There is still much unknown about the pathophysiology of COVID-19, the risk of disease progression and potential response to treatment, in both adults and children. However, if a medication is shown to be efficacious in adults with COVID-19, it is reasonable to assume that it would be similarly effective in children for a comparable indication. This would likely be true for antivirals that target the virus itself. Whether this will be true across all ages for agents with different mechanisms such as modulation of the immune reaction would need to be carefully A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Additional information in adults and children about biomarkers of treatment response, such as longitudinal changes in viral shedding, variability in baseline or cytokine measurements, and characterizing pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships of treatments to clinical outcomes and any biomarkers, would be critical for understanding how to extrapolate efficacy to children. Despite these knowledge gaps, the efficacy of pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 will be challenging to definitively establish or confirm in children through large phase III trials.

In addition, post-exposure chemoprophylaxis may prove to be a potent tool in controlling disease transmission, especially in the absence of effective vaccines. Children should not be overlooked in therapeutic research for this global pandemic threat. Priority pediatric research questions should target the knowledge gaps for each specific agent, and should focus on the pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing, and safety across the entire age spectrum, including young children and those with co-morbidities. Such studies will require coordinated efforts across multiple sites. The global community should commit to ensuring equitable access to any evidence-based treatments for children, including in resource-limited settings.",

Population pharmacokinetic models with clinical trial simulations can then be used to propose practical doses for use in the field or to inform additional trials. Even in the absence of pediatric data, population pharmacokinetic models based on adult data can be scaled using allometry to better inform pediatric dosing. 8.
