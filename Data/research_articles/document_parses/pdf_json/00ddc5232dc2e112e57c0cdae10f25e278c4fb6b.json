We develop a stochastic model of over-collateralized stablecoins that helps explain such crises. In our model, the stablecoin supply is decided by speculators who optimize the profitability of a leveraged position while incorporating the forward-looking cost of collateral liquidations, which involves the endogenous price of the stablecoin. We formally characterize stable and unstable domains for the stablecoin. We prove bounds on the probabilities of large deviations and quadratic variation in the stable domain and distinctly greater price variance in the unstable domain. The unstable domain can be triggered by large deviations, collapsed expectations, and liquidity problems from deleveraging. We formally characterize a deflationary deleveraging spiral as a submartingale that can cause such liquidity problems in a crisis. We also demonstrate 'perfect' stability results in idealized settings and discuss mechanisms which could bring realistic settings closer to the idealized stable settings.",

            "text": "On March 12, 2020, called 'Black Thursday' during the COVID-19 market panic, cryptocurrency prices dropped \u223c 50% in the day. This was accompanied by cascading liquidations on cryptocurrency leverage platforms, including both centralized platforms like exchanges and new decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that facilitate on-chain over-collateralized lending. Among many events from this day, the story of Maker's stablecoin Dai stands out, which entered a deflationary deleveraging spiral. This triggered high volatility of the 'stable' asset and a breakdown of the collateral liquidation process. Due to market illiquidity exacerbated by network congestion, some collateral liquidations were performed at near-zero prices. As a result, the system developed a collateral shortfall, which prompted an emergency response and had to be made up by selling new equity-like tokens to recapitalize [18] .",

It became a much riskier and more volatile asset, yet traded at a high premium and fetched lending rates in the mid double digits. Leveraged speculators, who must repurchase Dai in order to deleverage their positions, were exhausting Dai liquidity, driving up the price of Dai and subsequently increasing the cost of future deleveraging (we discuss some further causes that led to market illiquidity in developing the model in the next section). These speculators began to realize that, in these conditions, they face concrete risk that a debt reduction of $1 could cost a significant premium. Eventually, a new exogenously stable asset-the USDbacked custodial stablecoin USDC-had to be brought in as a new collateral type to stabilize the system [10].",

For a recent overview of stablecoins, see e.g. [4] and the references therein. Stablecoins are meant to bootstrap price stability into cryptocurrencies as a stop-gap measure for adoption. Current projects are either custodial and rely on custodians to hold reserve assets off-chain (e.g., $1 per coin) or non-custodial and set up a risk transfer market through onchain contracts. Non-custodial stablecoins aim to retain the property of reduced counterparty/censorship risk.",

This is similar to a tranche structure, in which stablecoins act like senior debt, with the addition of dynamic deleveraging. Two major risks in these stablecoins emerge around market structure collapse and price feed and governance manipulation. In this paper, we focus completely on the market structure risk, assuming that price feeds, governance, and the underlying blockchain perform as expected. 2 In addition to the COVID-19 panic, the effects of these risks are also witnessed in bitUSD, Steem Dollars, and NuBits, which have suffered serious depegging events in 2018 [16] , and Terra and Synthetix, which suffered price feed manipulation attacks in 2019 ([27] , [28] , [30] ) and similar manipulations on the bZx lending protocol in 2020 ([22] , [23] ). Stablecoins currently serve a central role in an increasingly complex decentralized finance environment, involving composability with other DeFi platforms. In addition, many other blockchain assets, such as synthetic and cross-chain assets, rely on the basic mechanism behind stablecoins, which we discuss further in the discussion section.",

We suggest an alternative: a buffer to dampen deleveraging effects without directly incorporating custodial assets. This buffer works by separating those who are willing to have stablecoins swapped to custodial assets in a crisis (in return for an ongoing yield from option buyers) from those who require full decentralization.",

A significant portion of stablecoin supplies are locked in other applications, like lending protocols and lotteries. These applications promise (in some sense) value safety in overcollateralization, but don't guarantee liquidity to withdraw. Additionally, Ethereum transactions cannot be executed in parallel; during volatile times, transactions can be delayed due to congestion, causing timely trades (especially involving transfer to/from centralized exchanges) to fail. This occurs even if, in principle, there is liquidity in these markets. On the other hand, longer-term demand elasticity will naturally depend on the presence of good uncorrelated alternatives. 4 We focus on the case of a single speculator, though we consider generalizations that accommodate many speculators in Section 5. The speculator has ETH locked in the system and decides the STBL supply, which represents a liability against its locked collateral. At the start of step t, there are L t\u22121 STBL coins in supply. The speculator holds N t\u22121 ETH and chooses to change the STBL supply by \u2206 t = L t \u2212 L t\u22121 . If \u2206 t > 0, the speculator sells new STBL on the market for ETH at the market clearing price Z t , which is added to N t . If \u2206 t < 0, the speculator buys STBL on the market, reducing N t . The specula-tor's locked collateral isN t and may or may not be equivalent to N t . Informed by limitations of actual implementations, we develop a particular formulation for the process (N t ) based on (N t ) in this section, though we discuss ways that this can be generalized in Section 5. 5 The speculator decides L t by optimizing expected profitability in the next period based on expectations about ETH returns and the cost of collateral liquidation if the collateral factor is breached.",

Another way to bring the stablecoin closer 'perfect' stability is to increase the supply of marginal speculators. As there will not be unlimited supply of speculators with positive ETH expectations (especially during an extended bear market), this relies on having another uncorrelated collateral asset. As all decentralized assets are very correlated, this again largely relies on including custodial collateral assets, like Maker's recent addition of USDC. 10 While these measures strengthen the stability results, it's at the expense of greater centralization and moves the system away from being 'non-custodial'.",

The Maker system charges fees to speculators, part of which it passes on to Dai holders as an interest rate if the holder locks the Dai into a savings pool. With modified mechanics, this savings pool can provide a buffer to deleveraging effects. For instance, if we allow Dai in the savings pool to be bought out at a reasonable premium by a speculator who uses it to deleverage, then deleveraging effects are bounded by the premium amount up to the size of the savings buffer. The Dai holders who participate in this savings pool are then compensated for providing a repurchase option to the speculator. The Dai holder could elect to have the repurchase fulfilled in the collateral asset, or something else, like a custodial stablecoin. In this way, this mechanism can provide some of the benefits of the 'perfect' stability settings while enabling Dai holders to choose how decentralized they want to be. A Dai holder who does not require high decentralization would elect to receive the compensation from the savings pool whereas a Dai holder who requires higher decentralization would choose not to use the savings pool.

Cross-chain assets that port an asset from a blockchain without smart contract capability (e.g., Bitcoin) to a blockchain with smart contracts (e.g., Ethereum) also tend to rely on a similar mechanism. In non-custodial constructions such as [31] and [29], vault operators are required to lock ETH collateral in addition to the deliverable BTC asset.

For \u03b1, D, L \u2265 0, \u03b1D + L \u2264 \u03b1 2 D 2 + 4\u03b1DL + L 2 \u2264 min 2\u03b1D + L, \u03b1D + L + \u221a 2\u03b1DLProof. Define \u03b5 := \u221a \u03b1 2 D 2 + 4\u03b1DL + L 2 . We have \u03b5 \u2264 2\u03b1D + L as long as \u03b1D \u2265 L( \u221a 3 \u2212 2), which is true since \u03b1, D, L \u2265 0. Next, notice that \u03b5 = (\u03b1D + L) 2 + 2\u03b1DL. Thus \u03b5 > \u03b1D +L since 2\u03b1DL \u2265 0. Lastly, by concavity, \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b1D + L + \u221a 2\u03b1DL.Prop. 1Proof. Consider X t+1 = XtR t+1 . For notational simplicity, drop subscripts as follows:ThenRecall that the integrand factor 3L \u2212 \u03b1DL 2NXz\u2212L \u2212 2N Xz evaluated at Xz = c is L \u2212 N c (the liquidation zeros out the speculator's collateral position), and evaluated at Xz = b is 0 (on the threshold of liquidation).Taking derivatives using Leibniz integral rule:Notice that \u2202b \u2202L > 0, \u2202c \u2202L > 0, g \u2265 0, andby assumption that liquidation repurchase price always \u2265 1. Additionally, the remaining integral is always positive as the integrand is positive between the limits and and g \u2265 0.Finally, E[R|Ft] \u2265 0 since (Xt) is a submartingale. Thus under the given conditions, \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202L 2 \u2264 0 as all terms are \u2264 0.Further supposing that eitherNotice that the 1 2 in the bound is related to the choice \u03b2 = 3 2 .This is \u2264 2 when L \u2265 27 46 \u03b1D. Thus under this conditionNote that all terms of \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202\u03c1\u2202L are non-negative and all terms of \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202L 2 are non-positive. Given \u03c1 \u2265 b/X, we have g c X\u03c1 and g b X\u03c1 are increasing in 1/\u03c1. Note also that \u2202b \u2202L , \u2202c \u2202L , andare constant in \u03c1. Lastly, the numerator and denominator integrals can be rewritten respectively asAnd so the terms in the numerator of |h \u2032 (\u03c1)| are growing by a factor 1/\u03c1 faster than the terms in the denominator as \u03c1 decreases, proving (2).Next, note that under the condition 0 < \u03c1 < 1,The last relation uses the fact that dc dL \u2264 2\u03b1D+L 2(\u03b1D+L) + 1 < 2, and so c > dc dL under the problem setup.Next note that for \u03c1 \u2264 L 8 and c \u2264 X\u03c1z \u2264 b, we have \u03b1DN Xz(N X\u03c1zThis is because the expression (1) simplifies to N X\u03c1z + L \u2265 2\u03c1, (2) to be true over the whole range of z, we need N c + L \u2265 2\u03c1, and (3) \u03c1 \u2264 L 8 is sufficient for this. Thus Then note that all terms in the numerator of h \u2032 (\u03c1) are greater than and grow faster in 1/\u03c1 than the comparable terms in the denominator. This leaves the first term in the numerator, which is constant in \u03c1. To get (3), then note that \u03b5 can be chosen such that for \u03c1 = \u03b5, the numerator and denominator are equal.We can derive the results for \u2202h \u2202n in essentially the same way. Alter the above dropping of subscripts with Xt \u2192 X, let n be a variable representing the realization ofNt, and consider h as a function of n. Note the following relevant derivatives.And translating the following to the new notationAnd by applying implicit function theorem, we get.From here we can proceed with the same analysis using factors of 1 n instead of 1 \u03c1 .",

Define the function f (X, n) = 1 h(X,n) where n represents the realization of N . With probability 1, the following are true:\u2022 h is concave in x and n because h \u2032 is decreasing, as shown in the previous result.\u2022 f is differentiable (wrt n and x) over domain using chain rule and implicit function theorem.\u2022 f is convex: it's the composition of 1/x and h, and since 1/x is convex and nonincreasing and h is concave, so is f (see [3] 3.2.4).\u2022 f is (strictly) decreasing (in n and x) since h is increasing.\u2022 By assumption, we've restricted N X. The derivative of f at the minimum value exists and is bounded.\u2022 f is non-negative since h is non-negative.\u2022 \u2202f \u2202n is (strictly) increasing in n. We havewhere h \u2032 (x, n) is derived in the previous proof using the implicit function theorem. h is increasing in n and h \u2032 is non-negative and decreasing in n. Thus h \u2032 h 2 is decreasing in n, and so \u2212 h \u2032 h 2 is increasing. \u2022 \u2202h \u2202n is increasing in x. This can be seen using the formulation at the end of the proof for the previous result as terms in \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202L 2 grow slower in x (in magnitude) than terms in \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202n\u2202L . In particular, the first term of \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202L 2 is decreasing in magnitude since L is increasing in x. And the integral in \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202n\u2202L increases faster in x than the integral in \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202L 2 , as can be seen by comparing the integrand numerators (a factor of x 2 in \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202n\u2202L vs. a factor of x in \u2202 2 \u03c8 \u2202L 2 ).",
