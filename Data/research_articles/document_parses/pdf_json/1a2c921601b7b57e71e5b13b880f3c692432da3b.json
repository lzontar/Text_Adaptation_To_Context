Health insurance, the Affordable Care Act, and self-employment Health benefits coverage may be a key driver when it comes to making self-employment decisions. Evidence of the difficulties in obtaining resources for health insurance has appeared in emerging studies, which, for example, reported that having access to spousal health insurance increases the likelihood of self-employment (Wellington, 2001) . Fairlie et al. (2011) showed that business ownership rates increased from just under age 65 to just over age 65 (when the qualification for Medicare starts in the US). Kuo and Lin (2020) found that implementation of the universal health insurance in Taiwan significantly decreased the rate of the self-employed who needed to absorb the entire burden of the premium for themselves and their dependents. Using a survey of entrepreneurs, Aggarwal et al. (2013) reached similar conclusion: the difficulty of obtaining affordable health insurance has a significant inhibiting impact on US entrepreneurs. They reported that as many as 88% of individuals identified the availability of health insurance to be the key factor in starting a business.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 391, "end": 409, "text": "(Wellington, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 412, "end": 433, "text": "Fairlie et al.

One of the goals of the ACA was to weaken entrepreneurship 'lock effect'. However, the first attempts to study how provisions of the ACA have affected entrepreneurship provided mixed results. Bailey (2017) found that the ACA's dependent coverage mandate did not increase self-employment among young adults overall but increased self-employment among disabled young adults by 19-23%. Condliffe et al. (2017) found no evidence that the ACA has stimulated self-employment among all young adults but found a positive effect on the likelihood of students being self-employed. Bailey and Dave (2019) reported a 3-4% increase in self-employment due to the ACA implementation and a rise of coverage of all non-elderly American adults from 79.6% in 2013 to 87.7% in 2016, and of self-employed non-elderly American adults from 70.7% in 2013 to 81.8% in 2016. Heim and Yang (2017) reported that the ACA did not increase self-employment overall in the states that lacked similar provisions prior to 2014 but found a statistically significant increase in the second year of implementation among individuals eligible for insurance subsidies. They suggested that combination of time to adjust, low uncertainty, and low insurance costs may be necessary for health insurance reforms to impact self-employment. In a study of Massachusetts mandated healthcare program, Jackson (2010) showed a drop in entrepreneurship in the area due to healthcare mandates. Finally, Barber III and Kavoori (2018) found that the ACA increased the likelihood that the self-employed would privately purchase health insurance. Guided by the evidence in these emerging studies we expect that, controlling for other characteristics, the self-employed are still less likely to be covered by health insurance even when the full provisions of the ACA are in place.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 520, "end": 533, "text": "Bailey (2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 711, "end": 734, "text": "Condliffe et al.

Among those few studies, there is no consensus on the effect of health insurance on women entry to entrepreneurship. Velamuri (2012) reported that self-employment among single women rose by 10% after the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (which introduced a tax subsidy for the self-employed to purchase their own health insurance). Similar effect was recently reported by Blume-Kohout (2018) in a conference paper, where data from the 2012-2016 National Health Interview Surveys are used to demonstrate that unmarried women had significantly higher probability of self-employment since the ACA health insurance exchanges opened in 2014 (but found that the ACA did not increase self-employment overall). The author argued that this is consistent with previous studies showing that women in the US workforce value health insurance more than men do. Also, women are more likely to use provisions in the ACA that guarantee coverage, such as pre-existing conditions, pregnancy, childbirth, birth control, mental health, and preventive care services. On the other hand, Gai and Minniti (2015) reported that having a husband who holds a health insurance policy had no effect on wives' self-employment decisions (as opposed to husbands' decisions).

Health insurance may be a significant cost to entrepreneurs, and women were shown to start their ventures with less money, to face significant barriers in obtaining the financing, and to start their ventures in less profitable industries (Malmstr\u20ac om et al., 2020; Coleman and Robb, 2009; Mijid, 2015; Riding and Swift, 1990; Wu and Chua, 2012) .

In addition to facing higher barriers to finance their ventures and starting ventures with less money, women entrepreneurs may also face higher cost of insurance. Women tend to keep their ventures small and are less likely to hire employees ). Thus, they may not qualify for often less expensive group coverage insurance rates. Additionally, women usually often demand more benefits such as preventive care services, childbirth, birth control, or mental health (Blume-Kohout, 2018) . Even though under the ACA most plans do cover some of these services, almost one in four (23%) of women covered by private insurance reported paying out of pocket costs for a Pap test, 16% for a mammogram, and 8% for a colon cancer screening; and these percentages were higher compared to women covered by an employer sponsored insurance plans (Ranji et al., 2018) . These services were not necessarily covered prior to the ACA and it is still uncertain if they will be covered in the future. eHealth (eHealth, 2019) reported that even after the introduction of the ACA, women face higher cost of private health insurance with an average monthly premium of $461 (versus $418 for men, in 2018).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 400, "text": "(Malmstr\u20ac om et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 401, "end": 424, "text": "Coleman and Robb, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 425, "end": 437, "text": "Mijid, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 438, "end": 461, "text": "Riding and Swift, 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 462, "end": 480, "text": "Wu and Chua, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1080, "text": "(Blume-Kohout, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1447, "text": "(Ranji et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Health insurance and self-employed women"}, {"text": "Entrepreneurial economic activity is embedded in the society and the importance of social capital and networks to entrepreneurship has been widely recognized (Bosma et al., 2004; Cope et al., 2007; De Carolis et al., 2009; Ertug et al., 2020; Florin et al., 2003; Pollack et al., 2016) .

We demonstrated that self-employed women are unique in their decisions to purchase health insurance and significantly differ from women in the general population. The question remains: why self-employed females buy insurance at the lower rate compared to their male counterparts? We speculate that women have less startup capital and find it harder to access capital, which combined with potentially higher insurance premiums, creates a much higher barrier to overcome. This is a strong result in institutional research with important implications for entrepreneurship and public policy. Our work offers further contextual nuances to existing research focused on female entrepreneurship and networks. We show that, for self-employed women, the decision to purchase health insurance depends on the source of financial information they use. Further research and theoretical models are needed in this area: why taking financial information from friends and family influences the decisions to purchase health insurance of self-employed women and why it has no effect on self-employed men? In sum, our findings suggest that future theoretical research needs to explore (a) decisions to purchase health insurance by gender and (b) the differential role of financial advice in making important business and personal decisions by gender.

For the self-employed, we report crucial findings because medical debt was found to be the strongest contributor to consumers' bankruptcy filings in the US. This effect may be even more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey from 3 April 2020, conducted by MetLife (an insurer) and the US Chamber of Commerce, found that 54% of non-sole-proprietor firms with fewer than 500 employees were either closed or expected to close in coming weeks due to COVID-19 (The Economist, 2020). In 2019, according to the report from the Urban Institute (Karpman et al., 2020), 26% of the self-employed avoided seeking medical care because of the cost (11% of the salaried workers) and 20% had problems paying family medical bills (11% of the salaried workers). In light of these facts, the self-employed and, as our results indicate in particular self-employed women, need to carefully evaluate significant risks of no health insurance. In the time of COVID-19, when the self-employed try to keep their business alive, unexpected cost of hospitalization and lack of family doctor may further undermine their ability to return to their ventures. The self-employed uninsured may not know where to go to get tested if they think they have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus and may forego testing or care out of fear of having to pay out-of-pocket medical costs, putting themselves, their families, and their ventures in further risk. For governments and policy makers our findings have quite profound implications. Most governments support self-employment (often emphasizing women self-employment) as the important source of jobs and economic growth. Recently emerging research voiced concerns that lack of appropriate health insurance alternatives has deterred entrepreneurship and suggested that universal health insurance or the ACA could facilitate creation of businesses by reducing the entrepreneurship lock (e.g. Bailey and Dave, 2019) . The Kauffman-RAND Institute for Public Policy claims that the ACA could lead to a 33% 'bump in entrepreneurship' over several years (Gumus and Regan, 2015) . Fairlie et al. (2011, p. 34) concluded that: 'relatively low rates of business ownership in the United States may be due to less comprehensive health insurance coverage than in other wealthy countries.' However, most of existing literature on health insurance has lumped together all adults, rather than searching for differential impact on certain sub-populations. We add that as an unintended consequence of the US policy, lack of national health insurance encourages economic risk taking, especially for female entrepreneurs. Anything that can be done to make health insurance more available to the self-employed, such as universal health insurance or the ACA, has potential to lower the risk of venture failure, especially for self-employed women as they put themselves in a greater risk for bankruptcy in case of health problems or national disasters (such as the COVID-19 pandemic). Our results suggest one potential solution to this problem. Our findings identify the source of financial information to be the central determinant in purchasing health insurance by self-employed women. Given these results, it may be beneficial to support free or lowcost financial advising on health insurance plans, options, and risks. Our findings indicate that such financial advising may be an important policy lever that could reduce the number of the not covered self-employed. At the very least, knowing that purchasing insurance depends on the sources of financial information suggest that public policy aiming at financial education is desired. Bernheim et al. (2001) reported that a majority of states have adopted consumer education policies, and a sizable minority have mandated that high school students receive instruction on topics related to household financial decision-making. Barber III and Kavoori (2018) speculated that one of the reasons for the lack of observed effect of the ACA from 2013 to 2014 may be insufficient public education about the benefits of purchasing coverage. Local, state, and national government bodies should not underestimate the need to justify and translate the benefits of the ACA and collaborate with local, legitimate partners who can explicitly address entrepreneurs (such as business support institutions).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2111, "end": 2133, "text": "Bailey and Dave, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2268, "end": 2291, "text": "(Gumus and Regan, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2294, "end": 2322, "text": "Fairlie et al.

The cost of health care, and its effect on uninsured and the self-employed, has been a political, economic, and social concern for the past few decades and is even more arresting during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the drivers of high health care costs and health insurance is the amount of uninsured who use the emergency services and opt for no preventive care (Barber III and Kavoori, 2018) . As women self-employment is on the rise, we can potentially see an increasing number of uninsured entrepreneurs. As Hessels et al. (2020) pointed out: 'Good health is essential to run a business successfully \u2026 and running a business successfully may lead to good health'.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 458, "end": 488, "text": "(Barber III and Kavoori, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 607, "end": 628, "text": "Hessels et al.

An interesting line for future research is to see if our results hold when these definitions are altered (e.g., a decision unit is a household, full-time salaried workers running a business or the rich that acquire a business as a passive investment are considered). Second, even though our models include a significant number of meaningful controls that relate to the probability of being covered by health insurance, we do not control for ventures' characteristics. In particular, one should investigate how our models work for different venture types (e.g. social ventures). Additionally, the SCF has no information on the location of the respondent and further studies may consider differences in how states handle the ACA provisions. Finally, the fact that this study uses the SCF data presents some limitations inherent in using survey data, as we rely on self-reports of self-employment and health insurance status.

We speculate that lack of resources and greater insurance premiums are the barriers, but this needs to be more theoretically developed and empirically tested. One other area of discovery maybe the risk tolerance. Even though our model does include risk perception this measure comes from a single self-reported question.

Analyses that only examine aggregate impacts may miss important heterogeneity among the self-employed. Such research may provide interesting insights that extend beyond our results.

The SCF is expected to provide reliable information on the US population financial characteristics. The survey provides weights ensuring that estimates pertain to the full population (Bricker et al., 2017) . For the purpose of our study, we only used respondents below age 65 to exclude those covered by Medicare. Therefore, we expect the results to generalize to the US adult population below age 65. We expect the results to be reproducible with other US samples. We do focus on the US with its rather unique insurance system; therefore, the findings cannot be generalized to other countries with different systems. Most of the industrialized countries in the world have universal health coverage for all citizens. However, in many countries, health insurance systems have been designed primarily to protect the paid employees. Often, the self-employed have a choice between public and private health insurance and premiums for private health insurance depend on age, a health assessment at entry, and gender. Also, the primary system may have more than one health plan (e.g. Germany, Japan). Therefore, it is possible that our results generalize to other countries regarding the choice to purchase better insurance coverage, which is left for further research. Based on our findings (and the results about job lock effect for Germany by Fossen and K\u20ac onig, 2017) we expect the self-employed in these systems to purchase less converge. Still, our gender and network results may not generalize since they may depend on access to finance, risk perceptions, and the culture in a given country. Additionally, our sample is from a WEIRD country (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic, as defined by Henrich et al., 2010) and conclusions about gendered effect and networks may not generalize to non-WEIRD countries and cultures, even with similar health insurance systems. We chose to study the effects of the ACA in 2016, the year when full provisions of the ACA were in place. In 2016, the ACA was still a new health-care reform (passed in 2010) that introduced elements of a public health insurance system in the US. The replication studies using later dates may not be able to obtain the same effects due to, for example, changes in the awareness of the ACA as more time passes, changes in the ACA legislation in later years, or the COVID-19 pandemic (which affected awareness of the importance of health insurance and the very health of many people). Finally, the majority of the SCF interviews were obtained in person and the median interview length was about 90 min (with some interviews that lasted more than 3 h). A direct replication would need to closely follow the SCF survey procedures and we expect the results to generalize to situations in which participants were interviewed in a similar way. The likelihood of false memory about insurance or sources of financial information is low and there are no reasons for participants to not provide accurate information. Having said so, some of our results are testable with non-survey data and it remains to be seen if they are replicable in this way.

Accordingly, academics, practitioners, and policy makers will benefit from this richer understanding of self-employment and health insurance. We provide actionable advice for the self-employed, policy makers, and business support organizations as well as directions for future theoretical and practical explorations.
