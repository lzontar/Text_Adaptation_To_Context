Therefore, it is necessary to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and the differences from adults. Case presentation: We report one pediatric case of COVID-19. A 14-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital with a symptom of fever, and was diagnosed with a mild form of COVID-19. The child's mother and grandmother also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, the lymphocyte counts were normal. The chest computed tomography (CT) revealed scattered ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe close to the pleura and resorption after the treatment. The patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool at 17 days after the disappearance of symptoms. Conclusion: The present pediatric case of COVID-19 was acquired through household transmission, and the symptoms were mild. Lymphocyte counts did not significantly decrease. The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and nasopharyngeal swabs remained positive for an extended period of time after the disappearance of symptoms. This suggests that attention should be given to the potential contagiousness of pediatric COVID-19 cases after clinical recovery.",

This was also confirmed by previous case reports on COVID-19 in children [3] [4] [5] . Due to the limited availability of diagnostic tests, testing has often focused on those who are more ill, which likely resulted in the underrepresentation of milder pediatric infections at the population level.",

Although the clinical symptoms already resolved at 9 days after symptom onset, the virus RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool first turned negative at 28 days after symptom onset. This suggests that the contagiousness of the patient remains unclear, despite clinical recovery. Persistently positive nucleic acid tests have also been reported in adults. A recent letter to the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) reported four patients with COVID-19, who met the criteria for hospital discharge or the discontinuation of quarantine in China (the absence of clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities, and two negative RT-PCR test results), and had positive RT-PCR test results after 5-13 days [11] . However, the clinical significance of positive RNA in stool as the possible transmission via the fecal-oral route remains unclear, and still requires further confirmation. Nevertheless, these results suggest the need to extend the monitoring period of patients after clinical recovery and hospital discharge, and take caution in handling the excretions of COVID-19 patients.",

During the SARS and MERS outbreak, cases in children have been underreported [9, 10] , and this is likely also the case during the present COVID-19 outbreak. Due to the limited availability of diagnostic tests, testing has often focused on those who are more ill, which likely resulted in the underrepresentation of milder pediatric infections at the population level. A latest research suggested that children are as susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus as adults. When looking into the close contact of people diagnosed with COVID-19, children under 10 years old, who were potentially exposed to the virus, were shown to be just as likely to become infected as the other age groups, with an approximately 7-8% chance of later testing positive. The same study also confirmed the role of household transmission as the major transmission route. Hence, for people who lived in the same household, someone would approximately be six times more likely to get infected, when compared to people who made contact in other settings [12] .",

A latest research suggested that SARS-CoV-2 invade cells through the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein [14] . The ACE2 protein is affected by developmental factors, and it is possible that the ACE2 protein in children has lower binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or that the intracellular responses induced by ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells are milder in children, when compared to adults. For adults diagnosed with COVID-19, many presented with a significant or progressive decrease in the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes [15] . However, the present case presented no significant depletion of lymphocytes, as the absolute number of lymphocytes were within the normal range. This was also observed in the other case reports on children with COVID-19 [3] [4] [5] . The depletion of lymphocytes were considered to be caused by a cytokine storm in the early stages of the disease, which stimulates the immune response, thereby consuming lymphocytes and suppressing cellular immune function [15] . The milder symptom observed in children might be due to the lower immune response. However, the exact mechanism requires further studies.",
