The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to several countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel estimation approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the spread of the disease through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predicted the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study revealed that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We found a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship was confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence revealed that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by~0.10%-~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirmed the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases. Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear. We highlight safety precaution and preventive measures to circumvent the human-to-human transmission.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "On 31 December 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) received information on an outbreak with unknown aetiology detected in a seafood market located in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The 2019 novel coronavirus was detected in 44 case-patients with pneumonia with unknown cause between 31 December 2019 to 3 January 2020 by the Chinese authorities [1] . On 11 February 2020, WHO named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19 and declared the infectious disease as a public health emergency, after spreading from China to other 24 countries [2] . As of 20 February 2020 (04:00 GMT), 76,498 cases had been reported globally including from China (75,245), \"Dia- Following the emergence of COVID-19, several studies have examined the transmission dynamics of the infectious disease [3] . While clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological features of COVID-19 [4] have been reported, phenomenological models using statistical methods have been used to examine epidemiological data [5, 6] . The COVID-19 is reported to have spread through human-to-human transmission [3] . However, it might be possible that other unobserved environmental exposures may have facilitated the rate the disease spreads through human-to-human transmission. Earlier studies based on phenomenological models fail to capture unobserved factors and heterogeneity, which are useful in understanding cases with limited epidemiological data. The complexities of the unobserved factors accounting for COVID-19 underpin this study. Using publicly available data for 31 Provinces/States across China, this study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to examine the nexus between the novel coronavirus attributable deaths and confirmed cases of COVID-19.
