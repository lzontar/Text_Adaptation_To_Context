Singapore achieved very high ER (3.0%) among Asian countries but CR remains high. This may be related to the fact that Singapore government discouraged healthy peoples to wear a mask until early April. 5 However, this strategy may not have been so bad since attenuation of virulence is reported in Singapore, 6 and our analysis predicted the lowest Infection Fatal Rate (0.005%) in the world in Singapore (unpublished observation). The good result of Thailand may be due to prompt and intensive preventive measures including lock-down. 7 Japan is criticized by its very low ER (0.17%), 8 but major western countries generally achieving 2 to 5% ER may show better (Austria, Spain, Germany), similar (Italy, France, and Belgium) or worse (UK, Sweden, and USA) containment than Japan. These results imply that the social distancing is probably the largest factor to achieve containment, and the contribution of broad PCR tests is smaller.",
