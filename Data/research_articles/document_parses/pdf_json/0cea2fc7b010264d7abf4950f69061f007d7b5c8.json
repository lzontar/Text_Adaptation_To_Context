Such decisions may have social and political consequences: the former will impact the community directly and the latter will ensure that political attention is focussed on the area. Both may be used to justify the collection of community views with respect to allocation of scarce resources in a pandemic. However, some might argue that allocation of scarce resources in this scenario should be based solely on expert evaluation of evidence. That is, evidence should be used to prioritise the needs of sub-groups in the population and to evaluate the effi cacy of specifi c health resources in addressing those needs. The objectives in resource allocation in a pandemic might include (i) maximising community benefi t, (ii) equitable allocation of resources, (iii) protection of vulnerable groups, and (iv) fulfi lment of obligations for reciprocity towards those who might put themselves at risk to provide care. Examining these objectives, it appears likely that interpretations of benefi t, equity and the bounds of reciprocity will differ across the citizenry and that it will be important to consider community opinion and values in making these decisions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In doing so we would address instrumental goals (Abelson et al. 2007 ): we would focus on collecting community views in order to build policy that better refl ects community preferences and values and is therefore more acceptable and workable. However, community views might be elicited for other reasons such as to support democratic or process oriented goals (Abelson et al. 2007 ). This orientation, which values citizen involvement in decision-making for its own sake, emerges from a number of areas including deliberative democratic theory (Smith and Wales 2000 ) , the rise of literate active citizen groups and the increased demands for public accountability for public funding. In this case the focus is on democratic decisionmaking, fair and transparent process and participant empowerment. Alternatively capacity building goals (Abelson et al. 2007 ) may focus attention on improving community health literacy and enhancing the ability for citizens to engage in debate in areas of complex health policy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 48, "end": 68, "text": "(Abelson et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 361, "end": 381, "text": "(Abelson et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 545, "end": 568, "text": "(Smith and Wales 2000 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 838, "end": 858, "text": "(Abelson et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Surveys are a widely used method for meeting instrumental goals: to elicit public views to inform policy decision-making or to provide public commentary or response on past decisions. A legitimate concern in gauging community views in this way is that the level of knowledge in the community about some of the more complex areas of healthcare planning and policy may be low. This may be particularly the case with emerging health technologies, new health threats or complex health policy areas. This methodological weakness may also apply to qualitative methods such as focus groups or interviews. The concern is that the community perspective, accessed through any of these methods, prior to a projected health emergency such as a pandemic, or before a new technology is rolled out, may change when the emergency occurs or technology is used and there is more interest in and access to information. In addition, policymakers might question the validity of citizen-driven decisions when the citizens have limited access to information to adequately inform those decisions. For this reason, deliberative process has been proposed as an anticipatory tool which can gauge the views of the community in policy areas that may generate future issues but where there is little current public debate (Warren 2009 ). Deliberative methods involve prolonged engagement with community members and provision of detailed information which the participants may draw upon in their decision-making. However, these methods also suffer from drawbacks, in particular with respect to how representative the views presented in small forums are of the population at large. These issues may limit the acceptability of deliberative methods to policymakers seeking to use community views to inform policy decisions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1292, "end": 1304, "text": "(Warren 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Which method should a policy maker use in collecting community views to inform policy and how will the choice of method affect the fi ndings?

We compared community views in South Australia on the allocation of scarce resources in a pandemic using two different methods: fi rst, a cross-sectional survey of nearly 2000 citizens using com-puter assisted telephone interviews; and second a deliberative inclusive forum which used stratifi ed random sampling to select a small number of citizens. The fi rst method offered a snapshot of community views in a policy area which, at the time before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, was not topical and on which the general public was not well informed.

Prior to 2009, the Australian Commonwealth Government as part of its pandemic planning had stockpiled nearly 9 million courses of antiviral drugs (Department of Health and Ageing 2009a ) which fortunately proved an effective treatment for pandemic-strain H1N1 viral infections. In addition, a specifi c vaccine against a candidate strain of H5N1 was developed (Department of Health and Ageing 2008b ) and an agreement to develop and produce pandemic viral vaccines as required was contracted with a private company (Department of Health and Ageing 2009a ) . Therefore with the emergence of the novel H1N1 sub-type in March-April of 2009, the Australian Prime Minister was able to reassure the Australian public that it was \"the best prepared country in the world to deal with the threat of swine fl u\" (The Daily Telegraph 2009 ).

The constraints of time and money meant that not all these goals could be met: choices were made which compromised democratic process in order to deliver outcomes which would be most useful for policymaking.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Theoretical Frameworks"}, {"text": "The deliberative forums took place while pandemic plans were still undergoing review, thereby allowing feedback of the outcomes to policymakers: policymakers sat on the steering committee; the fi ndings were provided to the state Pandemic Infl uenza Health Steering Committee on a regular basis; and a summary of the fi ndings were submitted to the Pandemic Infl uenza Sub-committee of the Coalition of Australian Governments (COAG). No explicit effort was made to feedback the fi ndings of the survey to policymakers but the fi ndings were reported at the annual National Immunisation Conference (as were the fi ndings of the deliberative forum) which is attended by policymakers working in the infectious disease area. However, we do not know what effect, if any, the fi ndings of the forum or the survey had on policy development.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infl uence in the Policy Sphere"}, {"text": "In comparing the outcomes from these two methods with the limited number of community engagement exercises on the same question in other countries, research method appears to be a major contributor to differences in the fi ndings. The choices made by the deliberative forum are similar to those made by participants in another deliberative engagement exercise, the Public Engagement Pilot Project on Pandemic Infl uenza (PEPPPI) project (HHS USA 2005 ), which was staged in four states in the United States (see Table 12 .4 ). Participants in the PEPPPI project supported the goal of 'assuring the functioning of society as fi rst priority in provision of vaccine', followed by 'reducing the individual death and hospitalization due to infl uenza'. The other possible options: 'prioritise young people', 'use a lottery system' or a 'fi rst come fi rst served' approach had little support. A similar exercise in Canada (Pan-Canadian Public Health Network 2007 ) on the allocation of antiviral stockpiles also supported the goal of \"keeping society functioning\" over \"minimize serious illness and death\". Support for \"minimize government's role\" with highest priority given to health care workers was not because they were at greater risk (although for some participants this was a factor) but because they played an important role in \"keeping society functioning and containing the spread\". This is similar to the fi ndings of the forum described in this chapter. Participants in a large survey in Ireland (Irish Council of Bioethics 2006 ), ranked health care workers as fi rst priority (Table 12 .1 ) which on the surface seems to be more similar to the fi nding of the deliberative forum than the South Australian survey. Second choice was the elderly and children. However, when the Irish citizens were asked the reason for their choice most chose \"treat everyone equally as possible\" (43 %) over \"give priority to sick and frail\" (27 %) or \"save the most lives\" (23 %) (Irish Council of Bioethics 2006 ). Only 5 % of the Irish respondents selected \"preserve essential services\" as their top priority. This suggests their choice of health care workers was to permit continued treatment of all, including the survey participants themselves, rather than preservation of the structure of society. This places the outcomes of the Irish survey more in keeping with the South Australian survey, which also did not envisage that a pandemic might pose a threat to social function, in contrast to both the PEPPPI project and the South Australian forum which did.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 512, "end": 520, "text": "Table 12", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1596, "text": "(Table 12", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Comparing the Two Methods with Other Data Collection Exercises"}, {"text": "The South Australian forum priorities fi t closely with Australian Government priorities listed in the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Infl uenza (AHMPPI) (Department of Health and Ageing 2008a ) for a severe pandemic: the AHMPPI would prioritise pre-and post prophylaxis for health care workers and some other occupational groups but also includes 'treatment of cases as clinically appropriate'. This might include the survey participants' choice of the young or the elderly if these groups were found to be particularly vulnerable to a specifi c strain but the plan does not include these groups without such a proviso.

In contrast, the forum provided informed community perspectives and highlighted areas in which citizens can contribute to our understanding of the values which citizens may hold in a situation of resource allocation in an emergency. It is noteworthy that a well-informed public, as represented by the forum, might be more likely to accept resource allocation as described in the AHMPPI, compared to a public who have been shielded from discussion about worst case scenarios. In this case study of pandemic planning in a pre-pandemic era, both of these methods proved valuable by providing insight into community understanding and values for decision-making about scarce antiviral drugs and vaccine.
