The way in which an optimal allocation of packages in different containers are done using a software controlled method. An agent based software module is enabled as a service for the optimum allocation of cargo packages in the container terminals. There are multiple factors that will affect this allocation -size, shape, weight of the cargo packets and the container. When we design an optimal allocation module in a software these components need to be addressed along with capacity of the container. Hence, a multi-objective optimization algorithm will improve the performance of cargo management software. In this paper we suggest a Mixed Species Particle Swarm Optimisation (MSPSO) procedure for optimal allocation of cargo packages in containers of different size and capacity. The redesigned version of cargo management software performs well with search space on normal time complexity. The simulated results gives an improved optimised allocation than normalised allocation of cargo packets.

This problem can be treated as a multi-objective task because more than one objective need to be considered while cargo packets are placed in a container.

The presence of local optimum with in specific neighbourhood has a significant effect on the quality of Pareto front determined. Considering all these parameters a mathematical model based on mixed species flocking for multi-objective optimisation is proposed. This model has five significant stages. There is a basic optimisation algorithm which controls the fleet of particles in the search space and has an enumeration for detecting the global best particle of the mixed species population [10] . To preserve the diversity of solution set and to evade premature convergence due to various local optimum solutions, dynamic adaptations are made to mixed species population. Procedure for particle depletion and particle augmentation that handles such issues.
