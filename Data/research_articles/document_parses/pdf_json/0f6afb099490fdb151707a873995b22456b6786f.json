On the third day of hospitalisation, due to the lack of appropriate therapeutic response and the disproportionate low level of oxygen saturation, limited portable echocardiography was performed and showed: situs solitus; D-looped ventricle; normal continuity of inferior vena cava to right atrium; moderate left ventricle enlargement and systolic dysfunction, severe right ventricle enlargement and systolic dysfunction and severe right ventricular hypertrophy; large sub-aortic ventricular septal defect (3.2 cm) with extension to inlet and bidirectional shunt (predominantly right to left); overriding of aorta; pulmonary artery originate from right ventricle with thick and dome-shaped pulmonic valve; relative dilation of pulmonary trunk (3.9 cm) and acceptable pulmonary branches (Fig 3) .

At present, our information about the clinical presentation and course of COVID-19 is limited, but numerous clinical complications such as severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiac injury have been mentioned in studies reported from China. [3] [4] [5] The chief complaint of our patient was exacerbation of shortness of breath irresponsive to oxygen therapy. In contrast, recent studies have shown that the most common symptoms of COVID-19 patients are fever and dry cough, indicating that the progress and the nature of the disease are different in various patients. The most common laboratory disorder reported in COVID-19 patients is lymphocytopenia (in 83.2% of the patients on admission) 2 that was also observed in our patient, which then gradually improved during treatment. The radiological findings in the patient's CT scan are similar to those mentioned in previous studies on the disease (pattern of ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, often with a bilateral and peripheral lung distribution); 6,7 however, the apparent cardiomyopathy, thick and dome-shaped pulmonary valve, and relative dilatation of the pulmonary trunk are specific to the underlying disease. With this in mind, it is important to consider other specific signs when examining patients' paraclinical findings of corona patients, as this may affect the course of treatment and the need for further diagnostic methods. Limited echocardiography indicated abnormal pulmonary valve with mildly increased gradient, highly suggestive of spectrum of tetralogy of Fallot anomaly. 8 Furthermore, polycythemia is a common laboratory finding in cyanotic patients with CHD, and in some situations, phlebotomy is performed based on ferritin level, hematocrit level, and patient's symptoms. But for the reported patient, we did not prescribe phlebotomy because of insufficient evidence in acute phase of COVID-19.",

Hence, any manoeuvres, which decrease amount of the right to left shunt, improve hypoxia. 9 Therefore, we decided to start the specific treatments of patients with ventricular dysfunction 10 to decrease cardiac afterload and filling pressure. Regarding the different physiology and anatomy of adult patients with CHDs, efforts are necessary to be made by related national and international societies of adult CHDs to collect data from a number of assumed and established cases to better recognise the prognosis of this special group and to develop specific protocols for treating adult CHDs patients who are infected by COVID-19. 1 ",
