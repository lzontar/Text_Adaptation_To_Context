Additionally, the isolation that results from social distancing may be harming well-being for families, as formal and informal supports become less accessible. For those with living with dementia and experiencing agitation, social distancing may be even harder to maintain, or social distancing could potentially aggravate dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms. To understand the lived experience of social and physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada we remotely interviewed 21 participants who normally attend a dementia specialty clinic in Calgary, Alberta, during a period where essential businesses were closed and healthcare had abruptly transitioned to telemedicine. The impacts of the public health measures in response to the pandemic emerged in three main categories of experience: 1) personal; 2) health services; and 3) health status (of both person living with dementia and care partner). This in-depth understanding of the needs and experiences of the pandemic for people living with dementia suggests that innovative means are urgently needed to facilitate provision of remote medicine and also social interaction and integration.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "With the emergence of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) as a novel coronavirus in late 2019, a global pandemic has led to varying levels of social distancing restrictions across the world.

Maintaining well-being is a key component of person-centered dementia care (Kitwood, 1997) .

It was evident in the data that if patients and care partners are expected to connect with internet technology, clear guidance should be provided to explain how to set up and use technology that may be unfamiliar to many. The ability for a care partner to provide confidential information to a clinical care team in advance of a scheduled virtual appointment was also expressed, particularly when the care partner wished to notify the medical team of symptoms that are potentially distressing or humiliating to the patient, or could lead to conflict. To address this need, our clinic is implementing secure web-based surveys that will allow the care partner to confidentially report neurobehavioural symptoms, function, and caregiver burden, using validated scales, with separate telemedicine appointments with the care partner as necessary. This work leverages data systems employed to capture patient data in the PROMPT registry, demonstrating another use of clinical patient registries for meaningful patient engagement and service improvement. Previous work has shown that neurological and psychiatric patient populations do not see registry participation as burdensome, but as an altruistic way to contribute to research that may or may not also provide personal benefit (Lee et al., 2019) . Enhancing communication and preparation for clinic appointments has been shown to improve health outcomes in non-pandemic times (Entwisthle & Watt, 2006; Street et al., 2009) and we can reasonably extrapolate that this would be true during times of social and physical distancing, as experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1391, "end": 1409, "text": "(Lee et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1540, "end": 1565, "text": "(Entwisthle & Watt, 2006;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1586, "text": "Street et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Strengths of the study include that it was embedded in a prospective clinic registry which enabled us to quickly contact people living with dementia and their care partners during the COVID-19 pandemic, and link their data to physician collected information on cognitive assessment and disease diagnosis.
