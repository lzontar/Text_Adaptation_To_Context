It is worth considering that children are the most vulnerable to respiratory pathogens, but fatal SARS-like virus had not caused severe cases among them. According to the pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children.",

However, for high-risk susceptible populations, such as the elderly with basic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, it is necessary to explore the acclimatization effect of the planned immune process on their immunity to achieve the trained immunity or immune fitness, so as to improve their own antiviral ability. , data on children (\u226418 years) suggest that there is a relatively low attack rate in this age group (2.4% of all reported cases)(1). Despite the low incidence of children, they also have milder presentations, severe clinical manifestations such as respiratory distress are rarely detected, even when pathological changes are moderate to severe(2, 3). This epidemiological feature is consistent with another outbreak of coronavirus-related disease, SARS, in 2003(4). We reviewed the existing literatures on COVID-19 and SARS and found that some studies have addressed this phenomenon. Determining the difference between how children and adults respond may be a new way to treat and prevent the disease.",

With the gradual increase up-take rates, the prevention of these diseases will become increasingly apparent. In this state of mixed infection, the immune response tends to be more complicated. Take RSV infection as an example, N protein of RSV is one of the target antigens for cytotoxic T cells (CTL), whereas the G protein was not recognized and can at best represent a minor target antigen for CTL (28) . If SARS-CoV-2 co-infects with other pathogens, the immune disorders will be more difficult to correct as can be expected. Clinical data shows the prevention and treatment of coinfections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with 60~70% of receiving antimicrobial treatment and 15% receiving anti-fungal treatment (31, 32) . Candida was isolated from 4 airway specimens in a case report of patients with COVID-19 (33) . These Candida might come from the environment or the oral microenvironment (34) . Thus preventing invasive fungal infections should be an important part of treatment (35) . During the SARS epidemic in 2003, therapeutic regimen in Hong Kong recommended the use of second-generation cephalosporin plus macrolide antibiotics in the pediatric patients as the first step in response to coinfection (36) .",

            "text": "Mixed infection was more common in children's community acquired pneumonia (CAP) with a rate of 16.02% ~ 34.63%. Viral infection is particularly important in the initial stage of infant CAP. Viral infection can directly invade bronchial epithelial cells, destroy the mucosal barrier, and cause immune disorders in the body and lungs. The detection rate of influenza virus in children's CAP is 4% ~ 22%, and adenovirusrelated pneumonia accounts for about 4% ~ 10%. On this basis, it is easy to combine other pathogen infection, such as other virus, bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma. The infection rate of dual virus was 19.1% ~ 30.0%, like Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses. The rate of virus-bacteria coinfection can reach 31%, which accounts for a high proportion in all age. S.p is the most common mixed infection bacteria. RSV +S.p is the most common pattern of mixed infection. More than half of mycoplasma pneumoniae-related pneumonia has mixed infection.",

            "text": "CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were productively infected by RSV in pediatric patients. Infection decreased interleukin 2 and interferon \u03b3 production RSV. The frequency of CD4+ RSV+ T cells positively correlated with disease severity (29). IFN-\u03b3 and TNF produced by CD8+ T cells following RSV infection contributed to both the acceleration of viral clearance and the induction of immunopathology. The actions of a variety of cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-4, played a critical role in the regulation of CD8+ T cell effector activity(30). The coinfection of RSV and S.p increased cytokine secretion and inflammatory cells infiltration in the airway. More importantly, when the G protein on RSV binds to S.p -related receptors, it can change the transcription level of S.p-related genes and significantly increase the virulence of S.p.SARS-CoV-2 has 16 antigenic components, which can cause different responses. The stimulating effect and the response duration of these components on CD4+ and CD8+T cell subsets differ from one another.",

            "text": "natural resistance to SARS-CoV. Various surveys published between 2003 and 2005 on this controversial issue(56-59). A group from Guangzhou held the opinion that the uninfected children had no specific antibodies. They confirmed the 1060 serum sample contained no virus particles by immunofluorescence prior to the serum specific antibody IgG and IgM detection, and only 2 cases of IgM and IgG antibody test result is positive respectively, they considered these few positive results for \"false positive\" of kits. This was at odds with a previously news report(60). Researchers detected antibodies in serum collected from non-SARS children hospitalized for other illnesses in Beijing in 2001 and 2003 in order to exclude the possibility of covert infection in 2001. The positive rate was as high as 40% in both epidemic and nonepidemic year.",
