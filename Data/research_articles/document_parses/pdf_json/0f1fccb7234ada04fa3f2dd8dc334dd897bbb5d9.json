With regard to alterations in antibody accessibility and binding, little is known about the general influence of spacer incorporation and effects of the spacer length, and its physicochemical properties. In particular, this is the case, when a carrier protein, e.g., NA, is used to mediate antigen presentation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 172, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "To investigate this issue, we equipped six model peptide probes with three spacer molecules of different type and length and analyzed their influence on antibody binding. Steric hindrance is an often associated problem when biotinlabeled molecules are coupled to avidin. Therefore, the peptide probes were precoupled to NA in high molar excess in order to exclude overlaying effects of the spacer molecules on the efficiency of preconjugation. PNACs were separated from unbound peptides, printed on glass slides, and probed with the corresponding mAbs. The results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 3 . Figure 3A shows a pseudocolored detail image of the linker analysis peptide microarray after antibody incubations and fluorescence read-out. The diagram in Fig. 3B displays the percentage of change of SBRs (Eq. (2)) for each mAb against the type of incorporated spacer molecule. Without spacer function, only anti-HSV-Tag mAb and anti-Hel mAb are detected well above background. The SBR values are close to zero for all other mAbs. The incorporation of the AHX spacer broadly increases the antibody signals. SBRs are raised between 5% (anti-T7-Tag mAb) and 90% (anti-Con mAb). All PNACs with AHX spacer enable detection of the cognate mAbs. The PEG spacer generally results in highest SBRs. Compared to the AHX spacer, the largest signal gain is observed for anti-T7-Tag mAb and anti-Pol mAb (95% and 83%). Minor increases are observed for anti-Con mAb and anti-Hel mAb.

Four out of six peptide probes absolutely require the incorporation of a minimum spacer length to allow for successful antibody capture. In general, the peptide-antibody interaction further benefits from the use of the PEG spacer, the longest spacer used in these experiments. In some cases, however, the extension from approximately 10 \u00c5 (AHX) to 60 \u00c5 (PEG 11 ) is redundant. Thus, the carrier protein NA does not serve itself as an effective mediator for antibody binding. Without a spacer molecule which spatially separates the peptide probe from its carrier protein, key residues of the peptide antigens rather may be in critically close proximity to NA or be sequestered in a complex with the protein and as such be inaccessible for antibody binding. For instance, the shortest peptide required for strong binding signals of the anti-c-myc antibody 9E10 (KLISEEDL) is localized at the N-terminus of the designed chip probe [16] . This peptide possibly needs to be separated spatially from the NA carrier to enable mAb binding and detection. The beneficial effect of further spacer extension is likely due to the fact that long and flexible spacers allow immobilized probes to approach reaction kinetics closer to a solution-phase reaction. The incorporation of a tethering linker function determines the presentation of peptide antigens in the array. This is all the more important since certain mechanisms of protein-peptide interaction require a free C-or N-terminus [4] . Melnyk et al. [12] previously analyzed the influence of the immobilization direction using an immunodominant 25 mer peptide antigen of the Epstein-Barr virus for antibody detection from blood samples and found a significant gain in sensitivity for N-terminal immobilization of the peptide. To determine influences of the immobilization direction of peptide probes on antibody binding, we immobilized peptides of three specified antigenic protein regions via their C-and N-terminus, two of which stem from the middle part of the parental protein (HSV-Tag, Myc) and one of which stems from the N-terminus (T7-Tag). An on-chip epitope mapping approach was used to uncover potential side effects on antibody binding occurring as a result of the unequal exposure of the binding region in the peptide when the molecule is immobilized in reverse (exemplified in Table 2 ). In addition, the Pol, Con, and Hel peptides were immobilized via their C-and N-terminus without epitope mapping, respectively. Figure 4 illustrates the outcome of our investigations. The diagrams display the data evaluation of fluorescence signals against the incorporated peptide probe. Figure 4A -C shows results of the epitope mapping approach for HSV-Tag, T7-Tag, and Myc peptide, Fig. 4D summarizes the results for C-and N-terminal immobilization of the Pol, Con, and Hel peptides. All binding relevant peptide-mAb pairs exhibit consistently higher SBRs for C-terminal immobilization of the peptide probes. The difference is most pronounced for T7-Tag and Pol (approx. 95%) and moderate for HSV-Tag, Myc, and Con (60-80%). A minor influence of the immobilization direction is observed for the Hel peptide, where the SBR difference averages 10%.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1036, "end": 1040, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1585, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1602, "end": 1606, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2443, "end": 2450, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2581, "end": 2589, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2742, "end": 2751, "text": "Figure 4A", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2839, "end": 2846, "text": "Fig. 4D", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "Although the results show consistently higher SBRs for C-terminal immobilization, we consider this systematic observation biased by the structure of the peptide probes.

As shown above, even short spacers can significantly alter the efficiency of antibody capture. Furthermore, the exposure of the antibody binding site in the peptide has additional effect on signal development, becoming particularly apparent in cases where the binding site is located near to the immobilization site. Most likely, these mechanisms underlie also the observations of Melnyk et al. [12] , critically affected by their use of two different spacer lengths and the relatively long peptide itself.
