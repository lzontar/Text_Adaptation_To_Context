As of May 2020, around 4 million cases have been detected worldwide, with over 284,000 reported deaths. Great efforts are currently underway towards the characterization of the virus and the treatment of its disease. Without the possibility of a vaccine envisioned for the near future, disease containment has focused mainly on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed at restricting the circulation of the population, as well as at reducing the risk of contagion in groups of vulnerable individuals. The choice of containment strategy is a key factor to 15 forecast the local severity of the epidemic, as evidenced by the outcome of divergent public health policies adapted by different countries. It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of models to assess the outcome of alternative NPIs will play an important role in the formulation of new public health 20 ",

[3] and [4] , where data-35 driven agent based models were developed for modeling the spread of seasonal influenza. In [5] the authors developed a structured meta-population scheme integrating a stochastic model for disease dynamics, with high-resolution worldwide census data and human mobility patterns at the global scale. In 40 [6] , the authors proposed a theoretical framework for the study of spreading processes in structured meta-populations with heterogeneous agents, subject to different recurrent mobility patterns. All these examples highlight the need for a data-driven approach capable of generating effective descriptions of com-another example, in [10] the authors developed a variant of the SEIR model without a compartment for exposed individuals (a SIR model) to fit data obtained from different regions of China, also estimating the local basic reproduction number.",

In [12] the authors adapted a meta-population mobility model to capture the spread of COVID-19 in Spain, incorporating empirical epidemiological parameters as well as mobility and census data. The Ferguson group at Imperial College built upon the previously mentioned models for the spread 75 of influenza [3, 4] , with the purpose of estimating the effect of different potential public health measures, with a focus on Great Britain and the United States of America (USA) [13] . Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). One of the most controversial proposed NPI is the formulation of periodic quarantines, 80 which in Ferguson's report are regulated by the availability and saturation of ICU beds. This idea was taken up in [14] , where the authors proposed a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10day lockdown, based on the predictions of a SEIR model with an ad-hoc square function modulation of the time dependent 85 reproduction number R(t).",

Thus, it becomes essential to measure the relative success of each case 120 and to incorporate this knowledge into models capable of assisting decision makers in the formulation of new NPIs. As mentioned before, a key parameter that reflects the dynamics of the epidemics is the reproduction number.

This departure from the classical theoretical picture is not due to behavioral factors and other exogenous epidemiological determinants.

Claims concerning the outcomes of public policies based solely on numerical simulations should be approached with utmost care. The situation is both novel and challenging, full of unknowns that cannot be dispelled by comparison with previ-200 ous epidemics, and several of the proposed NPIs (such as the enforcement of periodic lockdowns, or the pursuit of massive herd immunity) are unheard of in modern public health policy. The cost of implementing such policies could be huge, and failures could be even costlier.

Argentina has a total population of nearly 45 millions, distributed between 23 federal states (provinces), plus an autonomous city (the city of 255 Buenos Aires, or CABA). Most of the population lives in this city (2.9 millions) plus its suburbs (the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, Greater Buenos Aires or AMBA, plus nearby districts, totaling 40 districts with a population over 13 millions). The next most populated regions are the rest of the 260 province of Buenos Aires (PBA), and the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and Santa Fe. The first officially confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 was an infected traveler coming from abroad identified on March 3rd. On March 11th, all travellers from countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases were requested to stay in isolation 265 for 14 days. Schools and universities were closed on March 16th, and a complete lockdown was enforced on March 19th. Almost immediately afterwards, borders were closed except for flights bringing stranded Argentinians back from abroad, and vice-versa for foreigners. As a result of these measures, the 270 number of infectious travelers slowly increased until reaching a maximum, and then decreased monotonously with time (see Fig. 1 ). The nationwide lockdown was maintained until April 26th, when provinces with zero or very few cases were allowed to relax lockdown rules. In contrast, densely populated areas 275 (over 500,000 inhabitants) or with a large number of confirmed cases were maintained in strict lockdown for at least two more weeks, with the possibility of further extensions to the lockdown.",

Note that the averaged system constitutes a good approximation of the original problem. The parameters in 400 our simulation correspond to R(t) \u2208 [0.8, 4.16], with and average of R = 2.5. It is for this reason that in this example there is an epidemic peak. Suppression can indeed be achieved, but only if the average of the modulation leads to R < 1. In the case of Argentina, which implemented a long lockdown at an 405 early stage of the epidemic, R(t) reached a value of \u2248 0.9 as the most optimisic estimate (other countries reported similar values, see, e.g., [26, 18] ). It is therefore very difficult (or simply unrealistic) to implement an alternating policy that translates into average parameters leading to suppression.

Typically, an epidemic outbreak starts with few infectious cases that are spatially scattered. If the mobility of those cases is small, the epidemic will first develop in scattered foci and then slowly spread until all the interconnected susceptible subjects inter-425 act with the infectious population, reaching what is known as the homogeneous situation, described, e.g., by the system of Eqs.

We conclude that the structure of the empirical mixing matrix plays a significant role in the goodness of fit of our predictions, since the average MSE is higher for the shuffled than for the unshuffled mixing matrix (p < 0.001, and p < 0.05 for 17 of the regions).

We remind the reader again that simple epidemiological models, even when fed with data stemming from population census and detailed cell phone mobility estimates, are limited in what they can tell us. These limitations arise both from inefficiencies at the core of these models, as well as from shortcomings of the available data. Making these models more 900 complex does not necessarily improve their forecasting capabilities, specially in a situation in which solutions (and small differences) grow, in some cases, exponentially in time. As a result, these models should only be considered as ways of exploring possible solutions of the system, and extreme caution 905 should be exercised whenever these models are used to generate advice in the process of public policy decision making.",
