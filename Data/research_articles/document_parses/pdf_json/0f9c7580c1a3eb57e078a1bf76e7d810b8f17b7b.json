Most countries of the world have imposed restrictions on social congregations or even people working in close proximity to each other. Industries that produce and deliver information products and services therefore, have continued to function while those that manufacture physical products especially labor-intensive firms were forced to minimize operations or temporarily shut down. However, in most countries, physical products which were essential in nature were reluctantly permitted to be manufactured given the need for them in people's everyday life. In this viewpoint, I draw upon three dimensions -information intensity of product/service, information intensity of process/value chain; along with a third dimension -essential nature of the product/service to help understand the immediate implications of C-19. I also present some anecdotal evidences of attempts to alter business models in these circumstances in order to address the challenges that certain product characteristics impose but at the same capitalize on the business opportunities presented by the essentiality of the products.",

The toll that this crisis would exact is likely to be nothing close to what the world has seen thus far, given its ferocity and the very short time in which it has spread throughout the world. While the scientific community braces itself for the fervent process of prevention and cure in the immediate future and research and recovery in the long term; the business and management community has to do the same for the economic impact of the crisis.",

            "text": "In this essay, I adapt a simple, yet powerful framework to analyze and examine the strategic shift effected by firms in specific industries. Although I refrain from a detailed rigorous exploration of firms which have done so, I present some anecdotal evidences from industries which have attempted to alter their business models in these circumstances in order to overcome the challenges, albeit temporary, that their product characteristics impose but at the same time capitalize on the business opportunities presented by the essentiality of their products. I conclude this essay with some questions for deeper thought. Porter and Millar (1985) argued that information technology will play a strategic role in an industry which is characterized by information intensity of product (or service) and/or information intensity in the value chain or process (Fig. 1 ). The term process information intensity has been used to refer to the extent of information processing required to efficiently and effectively manage the activities in a firm's value chain or its business process. Product information intensity \"indicates the extent to which the organization's customers utilize information for the selection, purchase, use and maintenance of its products/services\" (Sabherwal & Vijayasarathy, 1994) . While on a continuum of product information intensity, physical products, such as say agricultural produce or cement may have little information content in the product itself; other physical products such as textiles may have relatively more information content associated with them such as size, color, pattern, etc. (Palmer & Griffith, 1998) . Banking and financial services, education, news or media, are products which are purely information products. On the continuum of process information intensity, authors typically cite construction or mining as examples of industries which are comparatively lower in information intensity than logistics, oil refining or automobile manufacturing which are in turn lower in process information intensity than say banking and other financial services (Hu & Quan, 2006) .",

Over the years, academic researchers have established that firms have also attempted to gradually move the information intensity grid ( Fig. 1 ) further towards the right, by incorporating information content into their product, making them more technologically sophisticated, or even servitizing products (Tronvoll, Sklyar, S\u00f6rhammar, & Kowalkowski, 2020) . For instance, automobile firms are attempting to design intelligent vehicles which not only aid the driver in having a safer and better driving experience; have innovative features such as remotely monitored access to the boot but also fully autonomous self-driving cars thus altering the structure of the industry's ecosystem while at the same time questioning some century-old assumptions of technological supremacy being the sole differentiator (Ferr\u00e0s-Hern\u00e1ndez, Tarrats-Pons, & Arimany-Serrat, 2017).",

However, in most countries, physical products which were essential in nature were allowed to be manufactured given the need for these products in people's everyday life. Of course, what constitutes \"essential\" is neither straightforward nor uniform across countries. 1 However, there is agreement on some of the basic essentials such as food, pharma and fuel, banking and bazaar. While in France wine sellers were allowed to open shop 2 quite early into the country's lockdown period; in the state of Tamil Nadu in India, the country's supreme court intervened and ordered the reopening of the state-run monopoly liquor outlets despite the protests by activists. 3 Interestingly, despite the fact that in most countries the mom-and-pop retail supermarkets were exempt from closure during the lockdown, e-commerce firms which sold essentials were experiencing significant rise in online shoppers. This highlights an important aspect of essential nature of products/services -that of the essential nature of the channel or delivery mechanism that is coupled with the primary product/service. Alternative mechanisms of delivery or distribution that reduces the need for movement of people or the possibility of physical proximity, are being explored by firms in some industries such as retail and hospitality.",

Although that is not the least surprising, what is interesting is the accelerated shift to digitization of processes that so far banks have been reluctant to move online. 5 The media and entertainment industry has witnessed a mixed impact. The dependence on media to share updates with the general public during such times of crisis coupled with restrictions imposed on non-home entertainment has resulted in increased viewership of television and a surge in consumption of streaming video-on-demand services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc., as well as in online gaming, again not unexpectedly.

Through the lockdown, restaurant regulars have shifted their preferences towards off-premise dining, drive-through food pickup, ready-to-eat meals, etc. 8 Some restaurants which have been traditionally dine-in have quickly adapted to producing boxes of home deliverable food which not only allow them to stay profitable, but also placed significant demands on their ability to quickly scale up and innovate on products that can remain fresh and interesting to their gastronome customers. 9 The mobility industry that includes ride-hailing (Lyft in the US and Uber across countries), ride-sharing (Gojek in Indonesia), vehicle sharing (Hertz in the US, Bounce in India) platforms came to an abrupt halt with the lockdown measures imposed by various countries, with a huge number of vehicles idling away in parking lots.

A comparative analysis of firms that have successfully made the transition into more digitized business models is a worthy exploration. Second, what are the agility and dynamic capabilities that have helped firms in capitalizing the potential for change that the C-19 crisis offered. Intuitively it seems obvious that firms that have the agility to quickly adapt to the changing environment have been able to see themselves through the crisis, and thus ensure business continuity. It will also be interesting to see if these firms can institutionalize these dynamic capabilities that they have seized during the crisis.",

Much like us, individuals, who prefer not to be disrupted, and if we are, choose to be so in own terms (Davison, 2020) , organizations too are likely to exhibit stickiness to their ways of working and prefer to return to their equilibria and status quo. Although the perils of such stickiness may disappear should the C-19 crisis dissipate, the opportunity presented for increasing degree of digitization in business firms remain.",
