Despite having available molecular knowledge of this virus, no definite vaccine or other remedial agents have been developed yet for the management and avoidance of EBOV infections in humans. Disclosing this, the present study described an epitope-based peptide vaccine against EBOV, using a combination of B-cell and T-cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation approach. Here, protein sequences of all glycoproteins of EBOV were collected and examined via in silico methods to determine the most immunogenic protein. From the identified antigenic protein, the peptide region ranging from 186 to 220 and the sequence HKEGAFFLY from the positions of 154-162 were considered the most potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes, correspondingly. Moreover, this peptide (HKEGAFFLY) interacted with HLA-A*32:15 with the highest binding energy and stability, and also a good conservancy of 83.85% with maximum population coverage.

[2] [3] [4] The genome of EBOV enciphers the seven structural proteins, ie, nucleoprotein (NP), viral structural proteins (VP35, VP40, VP30, and VP24), glycoprotein (GP), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L). 5 Among these, three different versions of glycoprotein are transcribed by the GP gene. [6] [7] [8] [9] Both attachment protein (GP1) and entry/fusion protein (GP2) are expressed from the full length of the GP chain, which are synthesized from messenger RNAs (mRNAs), containing an additional nontemplated adenosine. The soluble GP (sGP) is synthesized from the unedited RNA transcript. On the contrary, small soluble GP (ssGP) is translated during this process by adding two additional adenosine residues. 10 The GPs are expressed virally on the virion surface, which plays a crucial role in the catalysis of membrane fusion and amalgamation to host cells. As a result, it is considered not only a crucial component for vaccines but also an essential target for developing inhibitors and antibodies of attachment and fusion. [11] [12] [13] Protein sequence retrieval, evaluation analysis, and antigenic protein identification All available sequences of the GP of EBOV were extracted from the UniProt database. 20 After that, multiple sequence alignment was performed by using the ClustalW2 tool, and a phylogenetic tree was assembled by MEGA 6.0 21 software.

Prior of docking simulation, the three dimensional structure of HLA molecule was prepared by using the Phyre2, followed by intensive mood. As a result, 179 residues (99%) of HLA-A*32:15 modelled at >90% accuracy. In these study, 2BCK_Chain A, crystal structure of HLA-A*2402 showed the highest similarity of 90% ( Figure S1 ). The selected model has been chosen from the twenty models generated by Phyre2, on the basis of similarity and confidence level. Phyre2 is one of the best protein prediction servers that allows remote fold reorganization and homology detection. Using hidden Markov model (HMM), this server predicts the structure of given protein sequence by constructing backbone, loop modelling and adding side chains. 75 However in intensive mode, additional ab initio approach is used for reconstruction of missing region, backbone and side chain. 75 In docking simulation, among the other epitopes, HKEGAFFLY obtained highest binding affinity (Table S1 , supplementary material). In addition, MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA techniques are frequently to re-rank docking poses from molecular docking study, as they achieve a much better performance than docking scoring functions. 76 Nevertheless, the success rate of the absolute binding free energy prediction strongly depends on the systems. 77 Thence, we used both of these solvation models to predict binding energy more accurately, where the results from MM-PBSA examine the accuracy and reliability of the results from MM-GBSA. Results of binding energy calculation are shown in Table S1 . The relative magnitude of binding free energy obtained from GB methods is found to be consistent with those calculated using PB method, despite of the differences in the absolute value of salvation energy. As a corollary, these results also demonstrated the consistence with relative stabilities of HLA-epitope complexes. In previous published reports regarding in silico epitope identification of EBOV, [78] [79] [80] [81] the studies are limited to sequence-based scoring function techniques and some extend to docking simulation. These techniques have certain limitations, though these are very useful. 82 In docking simulation of peptide and protein, it faces problem like peptide's flexibility. 83, 84 Whereas, energy based approach like molecular mechanics and interaction energy scoring can add valuable information to sequence based results. 85, 86 Therefore, we have performed MD simulation study of 100 ns long to enhance the predictive power of the peptide affinity calculations to MHC molecule. In molecular dynamics simulation, both epitope and HLA protein were seen to achieve equilibration, while different fluctuations of RMSD were seen by the time evolution. Higher RMSD values of epitope indicate the flexibility in binding with HLA molecule, during the simulation. These results were further confirmed by the analysis of per residue contributions in dynamics simulation by means of RMSF and RMSD. Low values of RMSF indicate the core region of the HLA protein was stable, while high values of RMSD demonstrated the motion of the protein during the simulation. In like manner, the RMSD and RMSF profiles of eptiope confirm the synergic conformation changes to accommodate the binding pocket of HLA. The hydrogen bond occupancy analysis between the HLAepitope further confirmed the stability of the complex during the simulation. Overall, these results evidently demonstrate that both HLA and epitope have remarkable conformation changes to facilitate the binding and formed stable complex in thermodynamic environment (Figure 7 ). submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dash et al It is one of important factors in vaccine design that the distribution of HLA varies according to the diverse ethnic groups and geographic regions around the world. Therefore, wide range of population coverage must be considered during the designing of an effective design. According to the results from population coverage analysis, the epitope HKEGAFFLY showed wide range of population coverage in different regions of the world (Table 3) , where the highest coverage was observed Central Africa; one of the most EBOV infected areas.
