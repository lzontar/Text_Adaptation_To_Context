Through the virus' effect on surfactant and resultant alveolar collapse, patients have a progressive Accepted Article drop in PaO2 and an incremental increase in their respiratory rate. This process develops over days. The lungs initially remain \"compliant\" and patients effectively ventilate, lowering PaCO2 (1). They develop a large right to left shunt (2). I believe much of the lethality of Covid has to do with the lack of subjective symptoms despite the advanced underlying lung injury that is occurring. It has been postulated by Gattonini that the increase in respiratory drive exacerbates the inflammation and lung injury caused by the virus itself (1). Gattononi has described the intact gas volume of the lung and high shunt fraction of Covid pneumonia as an atypical form of ARDS, although there remains much debate about phenotyping Covid cases (2,3). Eventually, the cycle of worsening hypoxia, increasing respiratory rate, and the underlying lung injury precipitates overt respiratory failure. Acute respiratory failure, cardiac dysthymia due to severe hypoxemia, and thrombosis may explain the alarming number of Covid patients found dead at home. The lack of subjective symptoms found in Covid pneumonia also explains the many cases of incidentally discovered pneumonia in ED patients who present with syncope, fatigue and other medical complaints. I wrote of this phenomenon that I called \"silent hypoxia\" in a New York Times Opinion piece that published on April 20 th (4).",

It would be great if magic bullets arrive that can stop this virus instantly, or vaccines appear that prevent further infections.
