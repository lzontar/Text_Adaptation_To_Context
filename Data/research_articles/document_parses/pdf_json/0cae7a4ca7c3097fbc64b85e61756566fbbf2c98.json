This study aimed to determine the IgM and IgG responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with varying illness severities. Methods. IgM and IgG antibody levels were assessed via chemiluminescence immunoassay in 338 COVID-19 patients. Results. IgM levels increased during the first week after SARS-CoV-2 infection, peaked 2 weeks and then reduced to near-background levels in most patients. IgG was detectable after 1 week and was maintained at a high level for a long period. The positive rates of IgM and/or IgG antibody detections were not significantly different among the mild, severe and critical disease groups. Severe and critical cases had higher IgM levels than mild cases, whereas the IgG level in critical cases was lower than those in both mild and severe cases. This might be because of the high disease activity and/or a compromised immune response in critical cases. The IgM antibody levels were slightly higher in deceased patients than recovered patients, but IgG levels in these groups did not significantly differ. A longitudinal detection of antibodies revealed that IgM levels decreased rapidly in recovered patients, whereas in deceased cases, either IgM levels remained high or both IgM and IgG were undetectable during the disease course. Conclusion. Quantitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 quantitatively has potential significance for evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, has been identified as the causative pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) . [1] [2] [3] [4] This disease has been called a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). Since December 2019, a serious outbreak of the disease has spread via human-to-human transmission from China to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. 5, 6 The numbers of infected cases and deaths associated with COVID-19 are still increasing daily. As of 6 April 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has caused 1 210 956 confirmed cases and 67 594 deaths worldwide according to the WHO. 6 The diagnosis of COVID-19 is dependent mainly on clinical characteristics, CT imaging and a few laboratory tests. Although some symptoms and laboratory parameters have indicative values in confirmed patients, they are not unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Before the publication of the seventh edition of the 'Guideline of diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19' by the Chinese National Health Commission, laboratory diagnosis of confirmed patients was carried out by detecting viral RNA in throat swab or nasal swab specimens using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. 7 This method does not require live virus to be present in the specimens, but the turnaround times of the current real-time RT-PCR assays are long, and these assays need to be performed in certified laboratories. A high percentage of false-negative results were reported because of the quality of sample collection and multiple preparation steps, limiting the role of this assay for outbreak containment.

IgM can be detected as early as 3 days after infection and provides the first line of humoural immunity defence, after which high-affinity IgG responses are initiated and play a key role in long-term immune memory. 22 SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-coronavirus and shares some similarities with SARS and MERS, because of these similarities, knowledge gained from studies on these other pathogenic coronaviruses can provide insight into the antibody responses that occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection. 12, 23 Our data here show that IgM was generated in COVID-19 patients in 1 week after symptom onset, then reached its peak level in 2-3 weeks, after which the level decreased. Meanwhile, IgG levels increased quickly beginning a little later compared with IgM and were maintained at a high level for 2 months. Therefore, the detectable levels of IgM and IgG antibodies could provide information regarding serological convention over the disease course, as The positive rates of IgM and/or IgG detection were not significantly different among the mild, severe and critical groups. However, quantitative analyses of antibody levels over the disease course revealed that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels were higher and neutralising IgG levels were lower in patients in the critical group, as compared with the other groups, which might be because of high disease activity and/or a compromised immune response in these patients. In contrast, in the mild group patients, IgG was maintained at a high level, while IgM levels gradually decreased when most of the patients were in the recovery state of infection. Furthermore, the level of IgM antibody was higher in the group of deceased cases than that in the group of recovered cases, whereas the IgG level was not significantly different between these groups. The IgM level showed heterogeneity within the group of deceased cases, and some patients had very high IgM levels which might be in the active status of disease or very low IgM levels due to the long disease course . The increased IgM level in the deceased case group might be related to the higher disease severity in these patients and indicate a poor prognosis. Alternately, cytokine storm, severe immune dysfunction and other commobidities might be the important risk factors in these cases. 5, 18, 21, 24 Notably, the percentage of deceased cases in this study was 9.5%, which is higher than that of previous studies 19 ; this is because Tongji Hospital is a designated hospital for admitting severe patients. We also monitored the dynamic change in antibody levels in several recovered and deceased cases. In the four recovered patients (Patients 1-4) , IgM levels were low, but IgG was maintained at a high level before discharge, which is consistent with serum conversion as shown in a previous report. 11 However, the IgM levels in Patients 5 and 6 showed an increased even before the deceased time point. Neither IgG nor IgM was detected in Patient 7 within 31 days from symptom onset, and this patient was deceased on day 35, 4 days after the final antibody test was conducted.
