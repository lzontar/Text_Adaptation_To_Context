By culturing CD9-positive cells on laminin-coated plates, they could demonstrate their differentiation into endothelial cells, which was accompanied by decreased CX3CL1 and increased endothelial cell progenitor marker Sox18, as well as the CX3CL1 receptor CX3CR1. Similar changes in the expression of these markers were found in vivo during the neovascularization in the prolactinoma rat model. The authors concluded that CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in CD9/S100\u03b2/ SOX2-positive cells of the anterior lobe plays an important role in resupplying endothelial cells for vascular remodeling.",

Upon stimulation by ultraviolet sunlight, the NO x stores in the skin can be redistributed to the blood stream where they may exert a positive physiological response by lowering vascular blood pressure (Weller 2016 ). Weller and colleagues have been studying the aspects of this beneficial sunlight-induced process for a number of years (Liu et al. 2014; Mowbray et al. 2009) , and have now investigated the most effective range of ultraviolet wavelengths for generating NO (Pelegrino et al. 2020) . They used an NO meter with an electrochemical NO sensor to measure the release of free NO x species following irradiation with a range of ultraviolet wavelengths from both a controlled chemical aqueous solution simulacrum and human skin biopsy samples (Fig. 3) .",

Moreover, they interestingly found RSNO formation in human skin slices using light at both 320 nm (in the UV region) and 700 nm (in the visible region). These results are of potential interest for clinical trials and photodynamic therapy, but must be measured against the known risk factor of increased exposure to ultraviolet light for developing skin cancer. Ultimately, achieving a balance between the opposing health effects exerted by ultraviolet light on human skin is certainly of great importance moving forward.",

Also referred to as single-molecule imaging, super-resolution microscopy techniques allow Other groups have also contributed novel modifications to the expansion microscopy techniques (Li et al. 2018; Truckenbrodt et al. 2018) . In essence, expansion microscopy involves introducing hydration-competent polymer gels to physically expand the sample (typically achieving fourfold lateral expansion), resulting in a physical magnification and enhanced super-resolution microscopy (lateral resolution ~ 70 nm) with a diffractionlimited microscope (Chen et al. 2015) . Jena and colleagues (Pernal et al. 2020) have now provided additional modifications to the ExM protocol, referred to as \"differential expansion microscopy\" using rat liver tissue slices and cultured human skeletal muscle cells as samples. With their introduced modified protocol, they were able to achieve greater than 500-fold volumetric sample expansion, and demonstrate anisotropic expansion between tissues, between organelles, and also within organelles themselves (Fig. 4) .",

To achieve this enhanced resolution, instruments typically consisted of microscopes incorporating powerful lasers for the excitation of a specialized subset of fluorophores, together with a variety of software algorithms for constructing the final image (Klein et al. 2014). Recently, however, Boyden and colleagues have pioneered novel techniques, collectively referred to as \"expansion microscopy\" (ExM) for achieving super-resolution microscopy using both conventional diffraction-limited microscopy and fluorophores (Alon et al. 2019; Chang et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2015; Gambarotto et al. 2019; Tillberg et al. 2016; Wassie et al. 2019).",
