The X and Y arms are 4-kmlong, Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavities formed by the highly reflective end test masses and partially transmissive input test masses. Pre-stabilized laser light enters the detector from the left, and is further stabilized using an input mode cleaner optical cavity. Cleaned light then enters the Power Recycling Cavity (formed by a partially transmissive input coupler and two high reflectors), is split by a 50/50 beamsplitter, and sent into the long arm cavities where the light interacts most with the potentially changing gravitational field. The light returning from the arm cavities interferes at the beamsplitter, and is then extracted from the beamsplitter's anti-symmetric port by the Signal Recycling Cavity (SRC), similarly formed by two high reflectors and a partially transmissive output coupler. Finally, light exiting the SRC is cleaned with an additional resonant cavity, referred to as the \"output mode cleaner\". Faraday Isolators (FI) are used for optical isolation of the main interferometer from the rest of the instrument. The transmitted light of the output mode cleaner is split onto two photodiodes, whose output current is turned to voltage, conditioned, digitized, de-conditioned digitally, and then linearly combined to form d err .
