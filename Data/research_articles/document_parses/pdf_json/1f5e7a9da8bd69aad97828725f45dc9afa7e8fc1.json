The exposure to pollutants, such as airborne particulate matter and ozone, generates respiratory and cardiovascular diseases with increases in mortality and hospital admissions (cf., Langrish and Mills, 2014) .

The biological components of air pollutants and bio aerosols also include bacteria, viruses, pollens, fungi, and animal/plant fragments (Despr\u00e9s et al., 2012; Fr\u00f6hlich-Nowoisky et al., 2016; Smets et al., 2016) . Studies show that during heavy aerosol pollution in Beijing (China), 50%-70% of bacterial aerosols are in sub micrometer particles, 0.56-1 mm cf., Zhang et al., 2016) . As bacteria size typically ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 mm (Despr\u00e9s et al., 2012) , they can form clumps or attach to particles and transport regionally between terrestrial, aquatic, atmospheric and artificial ecosystems (Smets et al., 2016) .

In addition, airborne bacterial community structure and concentration varies with pollutant concentration, which may be related to bacterial sources and multiplication in the air .

(2020) Two mechanisms for accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 outbreaks in regions with high intensity of population and polluting industrialization: the air pollution-to-human and human-to-human transmission dynamics driving factors of higher viral infectivity of COVID-19 in the industrialized regions of Nord Italy, rather than other part of Italy (Tables 1-6 ). In fact, viable bio aerosol particles and high microbial concentration in particulate matter play their non-negligible role during air pollution and transmission of viral infectivity . For instance, airborne bacteria in PM2.5 from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei regions in China revealed that air pollutants are main factors in shaping bacterial community structure . Xie et al. (2018) indicate that total bacteria concentration is higher in moderately polluted air than in clean or heavily polluted air. Liu et al. (2018) show that bacterial concentration is low in moderately or heavily pollution in PM2.5 and PM10, whereas the pathogenic bacteria concentration is very high in heavy and moderate pollution. Sun et al. (2018) study bacterial community during low and high particulate matter (PM) pollution and find out that predominant species varied with PM concentration. In general, bio aerosol concentrations are influenced by complex factors, such as emission sources, terrain, meteorological conditions and other climate factors (Zhai et al., 2018) . Wei et al. (2020) also investigate the differences between inland and coastal cities in China (Jinan and Weihai, respectively) to explain the influence of topography, meteorological conditions and geophysical factors on bio aerosol. Results suggest that from clean days to severely polluted days, bacterial community structure is influenced by bacterial adaptation to pollutants, chemical composition of pollutants and meteorological conditions (cf., Sun et al., 2018) . Moreover, certain bacteria from Proteobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus have high tolerance towards environmental stresses and can adapt to extreme environments. As a matter of fact, bacilli can survive to harsh environments by forming spores. Moreover, certain bacteria with protective mechanisms can survive in highly polluted environments, while other bacteria cannot withstand such extreme conditions. In particular, bacteria in the atmosphere to survive must withstand and adapt to ultraviolet exposure, reduced nutrient availability, desiccation, extreme temperatures and other factors. In addition, in the presence of accumulated airborne pollutants, more microorganisms might be attached to particulate matter. Thus, in heavy or severe air pollution, highly toxic pollutants in PM2.5 and PM10 may inhibit microbial growth.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 894, "end": 911, "text": "Xie et al.

Zhong et al. (2018) argue that static meteorological conditions may explain the increase of PM2.5. In general, bacterial communities during aerosol pollution are influenced by bacterial adaptive mechanisms, particle composition, and meteorological conditions. The particles could also act as carriers, which have complex adsorption and toxicity effects on bacteria (Wei et al., 2020) . Certain particle components are also available as nutrition for bacteria and the toxic effect dominates in heavy pollution. The differences in bacterial adaptability towards airborne pollutants cause bacterial survival or death for different species. Groulx et al. (2018) argue that microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi in addition to other biological matter like endotoxins and spores comingle with particulate matter (PM) air pollutants. Hence, microorganisms may be influenced by interactions with ambient particles leading to the inhibition or enhancement of viability and environmental stability (e.g., tolerance to variation in seasonality, temperature, humidity, etc.). Moreover, Groulx et al. (2018) claim that in the case of microbial agents of communicable disease, such as viruses, the potential for interactions with pollution may have public health implications. Groulx et al. (2018 Groulx et al. ( , p. 1106 ) describe an experimental platform to investigate the implications of viral infectivity changes: Preliminary evidence suggests that the interactions between airborne viruses and airborne fine particulate matter influence viral stability and infectivity \u2026..

Especially, current evidence indicates that PM10 increases cough, lower respiratory symptoms and lower peak expiratory flow (Ward and Ayres, 2004; Nel, 2005) . Weinmayr et al. (2010) provide strong evidence that PM10 may be an aggravating factor of asthma in children. Furthermore, asthma symptoms are exacerbated by air pollutants, such as diesel exhaust, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3 and respiratory virus, such as adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (Jaspers et al., 2005; Murdoch and Jennings, 2009; Murphy et al., 2000; Wong et al., 2009) . The study by Liao et al. (2011) confirms that exacerbations of asthma have been associated with bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections and air pollution. Some studies have focused on the effect of meteorology and air pollution on acute viral respiratory infections and viral bronchiolitis (a disease linked to seasonal changes in respiratory viruses) in the first years of life (Nenna et al., 2017; S\u00e9gala et al., 2008; Vandini et al., 2013 Vandini et al., , 2015 . Carugno et al. (2018) analyze respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the primary cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children: bronchiolitis. Results suggest that seasonal weather conditions and concentration of air pollutants seem to influence RSV-related bronchiolitis epidemics in Italian urban areas. In fact, airborne particulate matter (PM) may influence the children's immune system and foster the spread of RSV infection.

In short, manifold environmental factors\uf02dsuch as air pollution levels, circulation of respiratory viruses and colder temperatures\uf02dinduce in longer periods of time spent indoors with higher opportunities for diffusion of infections between people. In fact, in Italy the high diffusion of viral infectivity by COVID-19 in North of Italy is in winter period (February-March, 2020).

In fact, respiratory mucosa is adapted to facilitate gaseous exchange and respond to environmental insults efficiently, with minimal damage to host tissue. The respiratory mucosa consists of respiratory tract lining fluids; bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells; tissue resident immune cells such as alveolar macrophages (AM), dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells and granulocytes; as well as adaptive memory T and B lymphocytes. In health, the immune system responds effectively to infections and neoplastic cells, with a response tailored to the insult, but must tolerate (i.e., not respond harmfully to) the healthy body and benign environmental influences. A well-functioning immune system is vital for a healthy body. Inadequate and excessive immune responses generate diverse pathologies, such as serious infections, metastatic malignancies and auto-immune conditions (Glencross et al., 2020) . In particular, immune system consists of multiple types of immune cell that act together to generate (or fail to generate) immune responses. In this context, the explanation of relationships between ambient pollutants and immune system is vital to explain how pollution causes disease, and how pathology can be removed. Glencross et al.

In general, air pollutants stimulate pro-inflammatory immune responses across multiple classes of immune cell. Air pollution can enhance T helper lymphocyte type 2 and T helper lymphocyte type 17 adaptive immune responses, as seen in allergy and asthma, and dysregulate anti-viral immune responses. In particular, the association between high ambient pollution and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is consistent with immunological mechanisms. In fact, diseases can result from inadequate responses to infectious microbes allowing fulminant infections, inappropriate/excessive immune responses to microbes leading to more (collateral) damages than the microbe itself, and inappropriate immune responses to self/environment, such as seems to be in the case of COVID-19. Glencross et al. (2020) also discuss evidence that air pollution can cause disease by perturbing multicellular immune responses. Studies confirm associations between elevated ambient particulate matter and worsening of lung function in patients with COPD (Bloemsma et al., 2026) , between COPD exacerbations and both ambient particulate matter and ambient pollutant gasses (Li et al., 2026) and similarly for asthma exacerbations with high concentration of ambient pollutants (Orellano et al., 2017 , Zheng et al., 2015 . In short, the associations between ambient pollution and airways exacerbations are stronger than associations with development of chronic airways diseases. Glencross et al. (2020) also argue that ambient pollutants can directly trigger cellular signaling pathways, and both cell culture studies and animal models have shown profound effects of air pollutants on every type of immune cell studied. In addition to the general pro-inflammatory nature of these effects, many of studies suggest an action of air pollution to augment Th2 immune responses and perturb antimicrobial immune responses. This mechanism also explains the association between high air pollution and increased exacerbations of asthma -a disease characterized by an underlying Th2 immuno-pathology in the airways with severe viral-induced exacerbations. Moreover, as inhaled air pollution deposits primarily on the respiratory mucosa, potential strategies to reduce such effects may be based on vitamin D supplementation. Studies show that plasma levels of vitamin D, activated by ultraviolet B, are significantly .

(2020) Two mechanisms for accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 outbreaks in regions with high intensity of population and polluting industrialization: the air pollution-to-human and human-to-human transmission dynamics accompanied by demonstrable benefits to human health. Pope et al. (2009) reported that PM2.5 concentrations fell by a third from the early 1980s to the late 1990s across major US metropolitan areas, with each 10 \u03bcg/m 3 reduction associated with an increase in life expectancy of 0.61 years. Because of health problems of polluting industrialization, Wei et al. (2020) suggest different air pollution regulations in regions having varied geographical and climatic conditions, and different bio aerosol pollution. In particular, Wei et al. (2020) suggest that different air quality strategies should be applied in inland and coastal cities, e.g., coastal cities also need start bio aerosol risk alarm during moderate pollution when severe pollution occurs in inland cities. Guo et al. (2019) argue that in recent years, haze pollution is a serious environmental problem affecting cities, proposing implications for urban planning to improve public respiratory health. In short, the long-term benefits of sustainable economic development are basic for the improvement of environment, atmosphere, air quality and especially health of populations (Blackaby, 1978; Bluestone and Harrison, 1982; Pike, 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 437, "end": 455, "text": "Pope et al.

Hence, it is important to reinforce evidence related to air pollution and inter-related factors of the transmission dynamics of virus similar to COVID-19, and helps policy makers to develop proactive regulations for the control of environment, air pollution, polluting industrialization and prevention of the diffusion of viral infectivity. The complex problem of epidemic threats has to be treated with an approach of dissolution: it means to redesign the strategies and protocols to cope with future epidemics in such way as to eliminate the conditions that caused accelerated diffusion of COVID-19, thus enabling advanced nations to do better in the future than the best it can do today (Ackoff and Rovin, 2003, pp. 9-10; Bundy et al., 2017) . This study revels interesting results of transmission dynamics of COVID-19 given by the mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission that in addition to human-to-human transmission seems to have accelerated diffusion of epidemics in Italy. However, these conclusions are tentative. There are several challenges to such studies, particularly in real time. Sources may be Coccia M. 2008 .
