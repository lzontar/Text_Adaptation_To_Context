Since the widespread availability of the hepatitis B vaccine with worldwide implementation of vaccination programs, one would expect a concomitant decrease in HDV alongside HBV. However, the prevalence of HDV appears to be rising and may be attributed to the higher prevalence of HDV infection in individuals with HIV co-infection and intravenous drug users. 3, 4 The global burden of disease is estimated to be 62 to 72 million, affecting nearly 1% of the general population. 4 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 199, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 367, "end": 368, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 929, "end": 931, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 932, "end": 933, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1048, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hepatitis D"}, {"text": "Infection with hepatitis D can occur under two circumstances (Error!
