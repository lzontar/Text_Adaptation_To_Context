Our objectives were to determine the impact of SBM level on apparent total tract (ATTD) and ileal (AID) digestibility during PRRSV infection and to determine ileal basal endogenous losses (BEL) during PRRSV infection. Forty PRRSV negative gilts were fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum. Treatments were arranged in a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial with high and low SBM (HSBM, 29% vs. LSBM, 10%), with and without PRRSV (n = 6/treatment). The remaining pigs (n = 8/challenge status) were fed a N-free diet. Chromic oxide was used as an indigestible marker. On day post inoculation (dpi) 0, at 47.7 \u00b1 0.57 kg BW, 20 pigs were inoculated with live PRRSV; 20 control pigs were sham inoculated. Infection was confirmed by serum PCR. Feces were collected at dpi 5 to 6 and dpi 16 to 17, and ileal digesta collected at dpi 7 to 8 and dpi 18 to 19. Feed, feces, and digesta were analyzed for DM, N, and GE. Digesta and feed were analyzed for AA. Data were analyzed in a 2 \u00d7 2 + 2 factorial design to determine main effects of diet and PRRSV and their interaction. Data from N-free fed pigs were analyzed separately to determine BEL and hindgut disappearance due to PRRSV infection. All control pigs remained PRRSV negative. There were no interactions for AID of AA; however, HSBM reduced DM, GE, Lys, and Met AID and increased Arg and Gly AID during both collection periods (P < 0.05). At dpi 7 to 8 only, PRRSV reduced DM and GE AID (P < 0.05). At 7 to 8 dpi, BEL of Arg, Ala, and Pro were reduced (P < 0.05) due to PRRSV by 64%, 39%, and 94%, respectively. At dpi 18 to 19, BEL of Thr tended (P = 0.06) to be increased in PRRSVinfected pigs; however, no other differences were observed. Pigs fed LSBM had increased Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, and Pro standardized ileal digestibility (SID), primarily at 7 to 8 dpi. At 7 to 8 dpi, PRRSV reduced Arg, Gly, and Pro SID (P < 0.01), and SID Pro continued to be reduced by 17% at dpi 18 to 19. Compared with HSBM pigs, LSBM reduced hindgut disappearance of DM and GE at dpi 5 to 8 and dpi 16 to 19, while N disappearance was reduced at dpi 5 to 8. There were no differences between control and PRRSV N-free fed pigs. Altogether, SBM inclusion impacts SID of AA and hindgut disappearance of nutrients, regardless of PRRSV.

Additionally, protein and fat accretion are reduced during a PRRSV challenge both acutely (Escobar et al., 2004) and throughout the entire finishing period (Schweer et al., 2017) . Dietary strategies are of interest to recover lost growth performance and promote earlier clearance of virus in pathogen-challenged pigs. One such strategy has been the use of increasing dietary SBM. It has been reported in a commercial production environment, that increasing dietary SBM to 32% inclusion can improve growth performance during a natural inflammatory-pathogen challenge in the finishing period of pigs (Boyd et al., 2010) . Similarly, in an experimental setting, increasing dietary SBM from 17% to 29%, reduced serum viremia load and improved growth in nursery pigs (Rochell et al., 2015) .

There was no diet \u00d7 PRRSV interaction (P > 0.10) at either time point or any effect of PRRSV on any ATTD coefficients evaluated. No effect of PRRSV on ATTD coefficients is in agreement with a previous study from our group (Schweer et al., 2016b) ; however, this is in contrast with another study from our group (Schweer et al., 2017) . In the later study, pigs were housed in a commercial barn and not in a BSL2 facility, and could have been exposed to secondary pathogens. Together, this would have had a higher immunological burden that would have contributed to the reduction in ATTD coefficients reported in this field study. Expectedly, there was an effect of diet at both time points postinoculation where ATTD of N was reduced in LSBM compared with HSBM (P < 0.01). This is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that as dietary CP decreases, so does N digestibility (Yu et al., 2017) . Also, at 5 to 6 dpi, ATTD of GE was reduced in the LSBM diet compared to HSBM (P < 0.01). This is in contrast with previous studies that reported no difference between high protein and low protein, AA-supplemented diets on energy digestibility (Kerr and Easter, 1995) ; however, these pigs were younger and not housed in BSL2 facilities. Apparent ileal digestibility of DM, N, and GE was also assessed from dpi 7 to 8 (Table 4 ) and dpi 18 to 19 (Table 5) . No diet \u00d7 PRRSV interactions were found at either collection period (P > 0.10). During both collection periods, LSBM diets resulted in an increased DM AID compared to HSBM diets (P < 0.05). Similarly, at 7 to 8 dpi AID of GE was increased in LSBM-fed pigs compared to HSBM (P = 0.027). There was an effect of PRRSV at 7 to 8 dpi for AID of DM and GE (P < 0.04). Dry matter AID was reduced by PRRSV in the HSBM fed pigs by 8.4% and LSBM pigs by 3.1%, while GE AID was reduced by 7.7% and 3.4% in the HSBM and LSBM pigs, respectively.

This could suggest that infected pigs require more Ala and Pro than noninfected pigs. Collagen is abundant in the lungs, forming the bronchovascular skeleton and is also found in the lining of basal membranes, and is rich in Ala, Pro, and hydroxyproline (Eyre and Muir, 1975) . Girard et al. (2001) reported that PRRSV increases collagenase activity in the lung at 7 and 14 dpi, which could increase the need for Ala and Pro. Basal endogenous loss of Arg was also reduced due to PRRSV. Arginine can be readily converted to Glu, a preferred energy substrate of activated immune cells (Maciolek et al., 2014) , or Pro which is involved in collagen synthesis, as previously mentioned. Nitric oxide (NO), a derivative of Arg, exhibits antiviral activity; however, there are contrasting reports on the ability of NO to inhibit PRRSV replication (Pampusch et al., 1998; Jung et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2017) . This could be a result of insufficient Arg causing NO inhibition, which leads to increased reactive oxygen species and ultimately apoptosis (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2007) . The tendency for reduced BEL of N in PRRSVchallenged pigs could suggest a reduction in the secretion of endogenous proteins such as mucins or trefoil factors, although mucins were not different at 21 dpi in a previous study (Schweer et al., 2016a) . Digestive enzyme secretion could also be reduced, and although this requires further exploration, we have seen no reduction in sucrase, maltase, or aminopeptidase activities in the jejunum of PRRSV-infected nursery pigs (Schweer et al., 2016a) . Differences in total tract endogenous N loss could likely be related to microbial density and activity in the cecum and colon. Total microbial diversity can be reduced, while proteolytic species (e.g., Proteobacteria) can increase in pigs severely impacted by PRRSV challenge (Niederwerder et al., 2016) . Similarly, increased microbial diversity and density in the gut can reduce coughing, lung lesion scores, and respiratory cytokines during Mycoplasma hyopneumoiniae challenge (Schachtschneider et al., 2013) .

Decreased SID of Arg and Pro due to PRRSV infection are likely due to the decreased BEL of each of these AA. In a repeated lipopolysaccharide injection model, Rakhshandeh et al.
