Data generated using experimental models support that IPS is a process in which the lung is susceptible to two distinct but interrelated pathways of immune-mediated injury: a T-cell axis and an inflammatory cytokine axis. These distinct but related pathways of inflammation culminate in the recruitment of immune cells to the lung leading to tissue damage and dysfunction (Cooke and Yanik 2016) Incidence -The strict methodology required to establish IPS diagnosis and the increased use of RIC have reduced its incidence of 20% to 25% observed 20 years ago (at that time IPS was called idiopathic pneumonia) -This reduction runs in parallel of the improvement in the diagnostic methodologies to detect infectious pathogens. However, the frequent absence of response to the specific treatment against a detected pathogen suggests that the true incidence of IPS may be underestimated -Nowadays: <10% of allo-HSCT (8% after MAC; 2% after RIC) Timing -Within first 120 days after BMT, usually observed between days +18 and +21 (20 years ago: around days +40 to +50) -Late IPS can be observed but they are exceptional (Thompson et al. 2017) Risk factors (from Cooke and Yanik 2016) Older age / Karnofsky index <90 / higher interval diagnosis-HSCT MAC or TBI (\u226512 Gy) / HLA disparity / GVHD prophylaxis with MTX Acute GVHD/previous viral infection / other malignancies than leukemia",
