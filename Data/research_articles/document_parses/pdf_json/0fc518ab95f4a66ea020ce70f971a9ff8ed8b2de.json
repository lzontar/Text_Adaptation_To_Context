COVID-19 is not only threatening the resilience of national health systems, but inevitably raises questions about the world's political and economic-financial future. The disease phenotypically presents itself in patients who may be asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, or whose clinical picture may be extremely severe and lead to death. Although every effort is being made to develop an effective vaccine or prophylactic treatment as soon as possible in order to manage the infection and prevent future epidemics [1] , even after the two previous coronavirus epidemics, we have found ourselves unprepared.",
