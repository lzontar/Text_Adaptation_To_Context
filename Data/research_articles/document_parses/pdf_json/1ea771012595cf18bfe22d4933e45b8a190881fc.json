Many recent studies show that network structure and human mobility greatly influence the dynamics of epidemic spreading. In this paper, we utilize a discrete-time Markov chain approach and propose an epidemic model to describe virus propagation in the heterogeneous graph, which is used to represent individuals with intra social connections and mobility between individuals and common locations. There are two types of nodes, individuals and public places, and disease can spread by social contacts among individuals and people gathering in common areas. We give theoretical results about epidemic threshold and influence of isolation factor. Several numerical simulations are performed and experimental results further demonstrate the correctness of proposed model. Non-monotonic relationship between mobility possibility and epidemic threshold and differences between Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi and power-law social connections are revealed. In summary, our proposed approach and findings are helpful to analyse and prevent the epidemic spreading in networked population with recurrent mobility pattern.",

On one hand, homogeneous mixing assumption among individuals is often invalid and variations of social interaction network bring large differences in the propagation process of virus [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . On the other hand, human mobility also greatly affects the peak and duration of epidemic outbreak [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , and recurrent patterns between people and their familiar locations (e.g. workplace, supermarket) often dominate the behaviour of human mobility [16, 17] . However, the interactions of individuals in public places provide another route of virus transmission, which makes the analyse of epidemic spreading much more difficult.",

Though some challenges remain [19] , a useful strategy of analysing the impact of human mobility behaviour on epidemic spreading is to integrate metapopulation model with reaction-diffusion process [20, 21] . Each subpopulation can be formulated as a node and edges between different metapopulations indicate the mobility probabilities of individuals. Reaction-diffusion process has been widely studied in physics, for epidemic spreading, diffusion often refers to individual movements between different places and reaction indicates the contagion process within each place after human behaviour. In addition to the way of using a unipartite network to model metapopulations for analysis of epidemic spreading with recurrent mobility pattern, heterogeneous networks are adopted recently [22, 23] . All these methods take the assumption individuals in the same subhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110016 0960-0779/\u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

There are two types of connections: one is the edge between any two individuals, and the other is connection between individual and common areas. The social network may follow different network structures, such as Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi or power-law networks. In order to model the dynamics of virus spreading, we apply the discrete-time Markov chain method in the context of susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) infection process like [8, 20, 23, 24] . With a mobility possibility, each agent will choose to get into public places which he connects to or stay in social network. Since there are no fixed individuals and connections among them, we assume people gathering in a public area will have contacts with all other individuals. The agent who chooses to stay in social network will have contacts with his remaining neighbors, and he may get infected if and only if he has some contagious neighbors who do not go outside at that time step. In this paper, detailed formulation of epidemic model in this kind of networked population with recurrent mobility pattern is introduced, and we also give theoretical results of the epidemic threshold. Besides, the decay of epidemic infection below threshold and impact of isolation factor are presented. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to analyse epidemic spreading in networked population with human recurrent mobility by using social contacts network among individuals.",

For small mobility possibility p = . 2 , the epidemic threshold of powerlaw network is significantly smaller than that of Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi net-work. As explicated in [27] , the heterogeneity of degree distribution in power-law network makes the largest eigenvalue larger than Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi network, and this makes virus more easily break out among individuals. When p increases, the differences between Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi and power-law network both in epidemic threshold and steady infection ratio become less obvious. This can be explained by the fact that, when more individuals go outside, more and more spreads of epidemic take place in common areas while the connections B between individuals and common locations are the same for both social contact networks.",

A heterogeneous network is used to represent the structure containing different connections. There are two types of edges, social connections among individuals and mobility connections between individuals and common areas. A detailed formulation by discrete-time Markov chain method to describe the dynamics of epidemic spreading is given, and we derive theoretical results about epidemic threshold. Several simulations on both Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi and power-law social networks are conducted and experimental results verify the correctness of our model and analysis. The non-monotonic relationship between epidemic threshold and mobility possibility indicates there is an optimal value which will make virus hard to spread. The influences of different values of isolation factor which restricts infected individuals from getting into common areas are analysed, and more obvious dispersion appears in power-law network because of heterogeneity of degree distribution. In addition, we demonstrate and prove the exponential decay of infection when epidemic rate is less than threshold. In summary, this pa-per not only provides an approach to model epidemic spreading in networked population with recurrent mobility pattern, but offers a tool to analyse different network structures and social measures, such as restricting infected individuals.",
