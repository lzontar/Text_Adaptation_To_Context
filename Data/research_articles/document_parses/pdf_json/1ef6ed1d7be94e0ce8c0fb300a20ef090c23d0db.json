Indeed, high-quality patient-centered communication is considered a main driving force behind satisfaction with outcomes [4, 19] . [20] . They found that most patients were overall satisfied with decision making and care; however, families were least satisfied with the waiting room. Analyses found that improving the waiting room atmosphere did not lead to overall improvement in satisfaction and that treatment of the patient and communication with the patients and their families were the drivers of satisfaction scores.
