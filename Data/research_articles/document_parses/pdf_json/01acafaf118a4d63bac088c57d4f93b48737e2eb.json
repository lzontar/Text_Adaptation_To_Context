We obtained information from the Food and Nutrition Service on waivers of work requirements for each quarter. We constructed an estimate of each PUMA's exposure to work requirements that reflects the average level of work requirements over the survey year and prior year. We weighted the quarters closer to the middle of the two-year period higher (e.g., fourth quarter of the prior year and first quarter of the index year) because these quarters would be most likely to be included in the 12-month window of a date drawn randomly between January 1 and December 31st.
