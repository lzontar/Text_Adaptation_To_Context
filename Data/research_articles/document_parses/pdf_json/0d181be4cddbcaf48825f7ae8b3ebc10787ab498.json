Furthermore, ARDS is a major cause of postoperative respiratory failure, with mortality rates reaching 40% in the general population. Mortality rates in the cancer population vary widely, depending on the type of cancer, and thoracic surgeries carry the highest operational risk of lung damage [5] . Plus, the case fatality rate is significantly higher for those with an underlying concomitant disease, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease.
