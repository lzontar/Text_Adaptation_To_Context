However, there is concern whether or not the public has adopted this recommendation. An observational study of 3,271 members of the public was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined the use of face coverings at grocery stores across 20 Wisconsin counties between May 16th and June 1st, 2020. Of the total individuals observed, we found that only 41.2% used face coverings. Individuals who appeared to be adults (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.20-2.27) or older adults (aOR = 3.67; 95% CI = 2.59-5.19) were more likely to be wearing face coverings than younger individuals. Additionally, individuals with female gender expression (aOR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.24-1.66) and individuals shopping at a more expensive grocery store (aOR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.69-2.25) were more likely to be wearing face coverings. We did not find an association between county level prevalence of COVID-19 cases and face covering use. To our knowledge, this is the first study using direct observations to examine face covering behavior by the public and our findings have implications for public health agencies.",

Given that the United States does not have a culture of face covering use by the public and recent media reports of violent retaliation by people asked to wear a face covering (2) , there is concern regarding widespread adoption of this recommendation. A recent survey by Gallup reported 68% of U.S. adults claim to 'always' or 'sometimes' wear a face covering in public (3) . To date, however, there have been no direct observational studies examining face covering usage by the general public in the United States.",
