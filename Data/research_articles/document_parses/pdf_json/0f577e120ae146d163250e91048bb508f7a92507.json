Considering the severity of the disease, a number of studies are underway, and full genomic sequences have already been released in the last few weeks to enable the understanding of the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Bioinformatics analysis, satellite derived imaging data and epidemiological attributes were employed to investigate origin, immunogenic resemblance and global threat of newly pandemic SARS-CoV-2 including Bangladesh perspective. Based on currently available genomic information, a phylogeny study was employed focusing four types of representative viral proteins (spike, membrane, envelope and nucleoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HKU1, MERS-CoV, HKU4, HKU5 and BufCoV-HKU26. The findings clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 exhibited evolutionary convergent relation with previously reported SARS-CoV. It was also found that SARS-CoV-2 proteins were highly similar and identical to SARS-CoV proteins, though proteins from other coronaviruses showed lower level of similarity and identical patterns. The cross-checked conservancy analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antigenic epitopes showed significant conservancy with antigenic epitopes derived from SARS-CoV.

The results clearly suggested that major proteins four proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were more aligned with the SARS-CoV proteins which might strengthen the claim of evolutionary convergent relation of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [Figure 2 (i)].

SARS-CoV-2 proteins with their homologous proteins of other coronaviruses. It had been raveled that SARS-CoV-2 proteins were highly similar and identical with SARS-CoV proteins. For examples, spike, membrane, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 showed that approximately 76.4%, 90.5%, 94.7% and 90.5% nucleotide similarities with the respective protein molecules of SARS-CoV. Again, in case of identity pattern, results showed that spike, membrane, envelope and nucleoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 were 87.0%, 96.4%, 96.1% and 94.3% identical with the respective homologous proteins of SARS-CoV.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "Four types of viral proteins (Supplementary File 1) of SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HKU1, MERS-CoV, HKU4, HKU5 and BufCoV-HKU26", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "Homology Modeling and Evaluation of the 3D Protein Structure of COVID-19The 3D structures of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins were modeled using the I-TASSER server, where 'SARS-CoV complex with human neutralizing S230 antibody Fab fragment' (PDB ID: 6NB6), 'Membrane protein complex' (PDB ID: 5X5Y), 'Coronavirus Envelope Proteins' (PDB ID: 2 MM4) and 'SARS CoV Nucleocapsid' (PDB ID: 1SSK) acted as the top threading templates of the S, M, E and N proteins, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 proteins showed 36% to 93% coverage and 40% to above 90% identity to the I-TASSER template proteins (SupplementaryTable 3). As I-TASSER usually deduces 5 different models for each operation, refinement by Modrefiner and validation by RAMPAGE and ERRAT were performed to check the accuracy of the modeled structures.After the refinement process, Ramachandran plot analysis was investigated to fix the structural accuracy from homology modeling. Ramachandran plot could do the placement of amino acids from modeled protein structure following the all attributes of structural biology, from where comparatively better model could be screened out. The present study revealed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 showed 75.2% residues in the favored region, 14.8% residues in the allowed region, and only 10% residues in the outlier region [Figure 3(i)A]. On the other hand, membrane protein exhibited 77.7% residues in the favored region, 15% residues in the allowed region, and only 7% residues in the outlier region [Figure 3(i)B]. In addition, two other envelopes and nucleoproteins also showed the highest number of residues in the favored regions (74% for E and 68.1% for N) and a lower number of residues (7.3% for E and 11.5% for N) in the outlier regions [Figure 3(i)C and 3 (i)D]. Again, for assuring more structural validity of the constructed models, the results of ERRAT had been analyzed. It had been found that values of the highest quality factor from the modeled SARS-CoV-2proteins (S=71%, M=88%, E=89% and E=73%) were significant [Figure 3(ii) and SupplementaryTable 3]. In addition, the probable immunogenic epitopes of major SARS-CoV-2 proteins were studied in the previous steps, andJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f here, all of the predicted immunogenic epitopes of SARS-CoV-2were presented into the validated 3D structures of the S, M, E and E by using PyMoL in Figure 4. Burden of COVID-19: Occurrence of cases Over two and half months, from its outbreak on 31 December 2019 to 20 March 2020, COVID-19 has spread to up to 182 countries and territories [Figure 5(i)A] and one cruise ship named 'Diamond Princess' in Japan, affecting a total of 253,796persons globally, including in Bangladesh; however, China was the most affected country[Figure 5(i)B], holding 32.06% (81,375/253,796) of global cases (Figure 6A and Supplementary File 3). The second-and third-most affected countries were Italy and Spain, with a total of 41,035 and 19,980 cases, respectively. The cruise ship, Diamond Princess, experienced 706 cases among a total of 3,706 persons. In addition, COVID-19 resulted in a substantial burden in Iran, Germany, United States of America (USA), France and South Korea infecting 19,644, 17,372, 14,366, 10,995 and 8,652 persons, respectively. However, the numbers of total cases in other countries ranged from one to five thousand (Supplementary File 3). Among 34 provinces in China, including SARs (special administrative regions), up to 19 March 2020, the highest number of cases occurred in Hubei (67,869) (Figure 6B). In addition, other highly affected provinces were Guangdong (1,370), Henan (1,273), Zhejiang (1,232), Hunan (1,018), Anhui (990) and Jiangxi (935) (Supplementary File 4). For both global and Chinese cases, there was a steady increasing trend of the occurrence of the disease per day from 22 January 2020 to 05 February 2020 and, in the same way, a steady decreasing trend from 06 February 2020 to 16 February 2020. Interestingly, on 17 February 2020, the number of cases worldwide (19,572 cases) and in China (19,461 cases) soared suddenly; however, the number started declining up until 25 February 2020 and then started rising sharply and reached to an apex on 20 March 2020 with 43,957 cases. Fascinatingly, after 25 February 2020, cases outside China increased more than those in China, which was an alarming signal that COVID-19 became a pandemic [Figure 5(i)and Supplementary figure 1]. Burden of COVID-19: Death toll J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The first death by COVID-19 occurred on 11 January 2000, and by 19 January 2020, another three persons had died. The global death toll (Figure 6C) started to increase from 20 January 2020 until 12 February 2020 and then followed an up and down trend until 22 February 2020. The death toll peaked with 158 deaths in a single day on 23 February. Later, it declined up to 26 February 2020 and again rose in a zigzag trend up to 07 March 2020. Then, the death toll peaked with 1080 deaths in a single day on 19 March 2020 (Figure 6C), and the cumulative number of deaths up to 20 March 2020 was 10,406 (Supplementary figure 2). Among 182 countries and territories, 67 countries had experienced deaths from the COVID-19 outbreak by 20 March 2020.The number of deaths was highest in Italy (3,405).

Among the 28 provinces of China with a death record [Figure 5(ii)B], the highest mortality rate was found in Hubei Province and was over 528 per 10000000 persons over the time period from 11 January 2020 to 19 March 2020; however, in Hainan, Hong Kong, Beijing, Heilongjiang, Henan, Chongqing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Xinjiang, the mortality rates ranged from one to seven per 10000000 persons. In the rest of the provinces, the mortality rates were below one per 10000000 persons (Supplementary File 4). Burden of COVID-19: Case fatality J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Case fatality denotes the proportion of deaths among cases or diseased individuals. From the analysis of cases and death toll data up to 20 March 2020, we observed that global case fatality was 4.10% (Figure 6D). Among the 67 countries with morality reports, the highest case fatality was 50.00% in Sudan, whilst the lowest in Malaysia as 0.19%(Figure 6D). Case fatality was also high in Cayman Islands (33.33%), Curacao (33.33%), Gabon (33.33%) and Guyana (20.00%). However, moderate case fatality was observed in Ukraine (11.54%), Algeria (11.11%), Guatemala (11.11%) and San Marino (9.72%). Besides, case fatality in other mostly affected countries was 4.00%, 8.30%, 5.02% and 7.29% in China, Italy, Spain and Iran, respectively (Figure 6D and Supplementary File 6).

In most cases, human coronaviruses evolve from zoonotic transmission, and bats are reported as the best J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reservoirs for zoonotic viruses[46]. Although the causative agent of COVID-19 has already been declared SARS-CoV-2[47,48], we adopted a protein-based phylogenetic study to reveal thephylogenetic relationships and divergent links of SARS-CoV-2 with other human coronavirus strains. Seven coronaviruses (COVID-19, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HKU1 and MERS-CoV), two bat-originated coronaviruses (HKU4 and HKU5) and one buffalo-originated coronavirus (BufCoV-HKU26) reported from Bangladesh were subjected to phylogenetic analysis of four types of their viral proteins (S, M, E and N proteins). It was clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV shared asimilar pattern of ancestral origin (Figure 1), and pairwise alignment indicated maximum similarity and identity between these two viruses (Table 1 and Figure 2). Recently, after the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting deaths [1,12-14], the WHO announced the genetic similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which were clearly reflected in the present study. In addition, HKU4 and HKU5 are bat-originated coronaviruses, and the similar genetic makeup of the other viral strains could indicate a similar host preference [49], although there were a few unclear reports regarding the possibilities of bats as reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 [50,51]. However, the divergent phylogenetic relationships and minor alignment patterns of SARS-CoV-2 with the bat-originated viruses HKU4 and HKU5 suggested that there was a low possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being connected with bats(Figure 1 and Table 1).As the NCBI database until now documented only the genome materials of a buffalo coronavirus (BufCoV HKU26) from domestic water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) in Bangladesh[10], a comparative study of BufCoV-HKU26 with SARS-CoV-2 was employed with phylogenetic analysis and pairwise alignment of the targeted viral proteins. The study revealed that BufCoV-HKU26 showed divergent relationships and low pairwise alignment of S (29.5% identity and 44.2% similarity), M (37.4% identity and 55.7% similarity), E (20.9% identity and 44.2% similarity) and N proteins (32.7% identity and 48.6% similarity) with SARS-CoV-2. However, as BufCoV-HKU26 is an animal-originated coronavirus, its proteins always exhibited an ancestral relationship with the other animal-originated virus HCoV-OC43(Figure 1).

As Dhaka is an industrial and commercial zone and all the official works of Bangladesh are centralized here most of the visitors or people returning to the country stay here for an extended period.

Moreover, potential B-cell epitopes were also identified from HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HKU1, MERS-CoV, HKU4, HKU5 and BufCoV-HKU26 proteins (Supplementary", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF11": {"text": "Higher levels of conservation among antigenic epitope sites of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV supported a similar ancestry in their pathogenicity.

The national health authorities of China detected a cluster of 44 pneumonia patients of unknown etiology from 31 December 2019 to 3 January 2020 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China and reported this detection to the WHO Chinese office [1]. Moreover, on 7 January, they identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus [68]. Similar to COVID-19, the world experienced an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 caused by a coronavirus also originating from China (Guangdong Province), which was suggested to be a potential zone of reemergence of coronaviruses [47,69]. However, on 14 March 2020 WHO declared Europe as new epicentre of COVID-19 outbreak [43]. had spread to up to 182 countries and territories, and one cruise ship named 'Diamond Princess' in Japan [20], infecting 2,53,796 persons globally [1]. In contrast, SARS infected 8,450 persons and caused 810 deaths globally in 33 countries [70]. Moreover, MERS, another coronavirus associated with an epidemic, started in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 and spread to up to 27 countries affecting a total of 2494 persons and causing 858 deaths throughout the world up to November 2019 [71]. Therefore, COVID-19 has already covered approximately 5.52 times more countries than SARS and MERS [1,70]. In addition, up to 20 March, COVID-19 has been attributed 30.03 and 101.76 times more cases, and 12.85 and 12.13 times more deaths globally than SARS and MERS, respectively [20,70,71].

For example, all of Italy has been placed under lockdown due to COVID-19.

Human coronaviruses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, Severe Acute temperatures, such as 4\u00b0C or less, this virus persisted for as long as 28 days, and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20% relative humidity. Inactivation was more rapid at 20\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C at all humidity levels. Likewise, coronaviruses were inactivated more rapidly at 40\u00b0C than at 20\u00b0C[41]. Recently, the authors established that temperature significantly changed COVID-19 mutation [60]; until now, there has been no concrete evidence that the virus has already changed with regards to disease severity or infectivity.

Thus, in affected countries, COVIDwhich were caused by small patches of cloud cover. Thus, the temperature is much higher in Bangladesh than in Wuhan, Korea and Italy.
