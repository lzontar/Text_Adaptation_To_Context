A striking example of this is the remodelling of intracellular membranes into specialized structures that support the replication of positive-sense ssRNA (+RNA) viruses infecting eukaryotes. These distinct forms of virus-induced structures include double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), found during viral infections as diverse and notorious as those of coronaviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses, or hepatitis C virus. Our understanding of these DMVs has evolved over the past 15 years thanks to advances in imaging techniques and modern molecular biology tools. In this article, we review contemporary understanding of the biogenesis, structure, and function of virus-induced DMVs as well as the open questions posed by these intriguing structures.",

These virus-induced membrane modifications are increasingly referred to as viral replication organelles (ROs), a term that captures the idea of a subcellular structure that serves the invading virus rather than the host cell. Viral ROs may provide optimal platforms for viral RNA (vRNA) synthesis by concentrating viral replicative proteins and relevant host factors, and may hide replication intermediates, contributing to the evasion of innate immune sensors that can detect vRNA [1] . Additionally, they may help to spatially coordinate different steps in the viral replication cycle. Interestingly, while viral ROs are a hallmark of +RNA virus infections, the confinement of viral replication to a specific altered region of the cytoplasm appears to be an advantageous strategy that is also employed by other viruses [2] [3] [4] . Due to their conserved role in the replication cycle of +RNA viruses, viral ROs are attractive targets for novel antiviral strategies.",

            "text": "Different families of +RNA viruses target diverse intracellular membranes to generate complex and unique membrane rearrangements. However, +RNA viruses seem to segregate into two main groups regarding the ROs they induce. The first group includes viruses that generate spherules via the formation of invaginations in specific host organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, or endolysosomes, (reviewed in [5] ; see also [6, 7] ). These invaginated spherules remain connected to the cytosol by a narrow channel that can mediate import of metabolites and export of newly-synthesized positive-sense vRNAs to the cytosol for translation and packaging into new virions. The second class of +RNA viruses induces vesiculotubular membrane clusters containing different structural elements, among which DMVs have emerged as a recurrent motif. Double-membrane organelles are somewhat atypical structures, limited in animal cells to the nucleus, mitochondria, and autophagosomes. Yet DMVs are induced in cells infected with a number of +RNA viruses, including picornaviruses (e.g., poliovirus) [8] [9] [10] , noroviruses [11] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [12] , arteriviruses [13, 14] , and coronaviruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses [15] [16] [17] . Moreover, DMV-like structures have also been reported in infections with a number of plant +RNA viruses [18, 19] . In Positive-sense RNA viruses utilize host membranes to generate viral replication organelles (ROs), inducing either invaginated spherules or double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) to support viral RNA synthesis.",

Advances in EM for the Study of Viral ROs During the past 15 years, electron tomography (ET) has revealed the detailed 3D architecture of viral ROs [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] 17, 20] . To generate a 3D volume from the projection images generated in a transmission EM by ET (reviewed in [94]), a series of projection images is recorded while the sample (usually a 100-300 nm thick section through the infected cell) is gradually tilted in the microscope along one or two orthogonal axes. Subsequently, these tilt-series are computationally aligned and reconstructed into a 3D volume (tomogram) whose virtual slices are only a few nanometres thick, thus much thinner than the slices achievable by manual sectioning. In this way fine details of the RO architecture (e.g., small neck-like membrane connections), which may be obscured in the 2D projection images, can be resolved.",

            "text": "Prior to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, samples are typically fixed, stained and sectioned. The classical approach is chemical fixation, using crosslinkers such as glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde to stabilize the cellular ultrastructure for further processing. This method, however, is prone to structural artefacts which can be minimized by the use of cryo-fixation followed by freeze substitution [95] . With cryo-fixation, the sample is quickly frozen by immersion in a cryogen (plunge-freezing) or, more commonly, under pressure (high-pressure freezing) to hamper ice-crystal formation. Cryo-fixation allows better preservation of membranous structures; this can be particularly beneficial for the visualization of viral ROs [13, 96] . Depending on the approach to fixation and the protocol used for subsequent staining steps, the appearance of different subcellular elements can vary significantly. Virus-induced DMVs, which appear to be particularly fragile, are perhaps one of the best examples to illustrate this point ( Figure I ) and how the interpretation of structural details should always be guided by the technical limitations in EM sample preparation.",

CLEM methods facilitate the identification of specific target areas for sequential light and electron microscopy, after which data from the two modalities can be overlaid and interpreted together. Furthermore, the ability to monitor live cells ahead of CLEM adds temporal information to intrinsically static EM images, meaning rare or transient events, such as RO biogenesis, can be pinpointed ahead of fixation [26, 76, 97] . , and MERScoronavirus (D, fixed by high-pressure freezing), respectively. DMV membranes appear tightly apposed and with minimal deformation, illustrating the superior structural preservation of this approach.

At one extreme, the DMVs induced by nidoviruses appear to define closed compartments whose outer membranes are frequently connected to other virus-induced membrane structures or to the ER, [11, 12, 25, 27] . Single-membrane tubules (SMTs), sometimes together with SMVs, appear early in picornavirus infections and are DMV precursors [8] [9] [10] 98] . Picornaviruses, HCV, and noroviruses also generate multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), which arise late in infection from massive enwrapping of certain replication organelle (RO) elements by others [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Double-membrane tubules (DMTs) are also late structures that may arise from DMVs [12] . Nidoviruses induce additional double-membrane structures, including paired membranes (PMs) [13, 29] which, in the case of coronaviruses, adopt different configurations, from a nonbranching form, termed zippered ER (Zip-ER) [20, 99] , to a highly labyrinthine structure known as convoluted membranes (CMs) [15] [16] [17] 100] . Small open doublemembrane spherules (DMSs), highly reminiscent of the invaginated spherules induced by other +RNA viruses, are formed as invaginations in Zip-ER or CM [17, 20, 99] .

When considered collectively, these structures define divergent and complex ROs that can transform over the course of infection. This raises questions about their potentially differentiated roles that remain largely unanswered. A particularly pertinent question is which of these elements serve as platforms for vRNA synthesis. Localization of key viral components (e.g., by immuno-EM) is insufficient to shed light on this matter as only a small proportion of these may be engaged in active replication complexes, as elegantly demonstrated using biochemical approaches [21] . Many viral proteins are known or suspected to have additional functions in the virus-directed manipulation of the infected cell. In recent years, the more reliable method of metabolic labelling of newly synthesized vRNA has produced abundant experimental evidence that points to DMVs as active sites of vRNA synthesis [9, 10, 17, [22] [23] [24] . However, intriguing differences seem to exist among virus groups. While the single-membrane structures of picornaviruses are also active sites of vRNA replication and, as predominant structures at the peak of viral replication, may be the most relevant RO elements [9, 10, 24] , coronavirus-induced DMVs appear to be the primaryif not exclusivesites of vRNA synthesis [17] .",

In recent years, 3D ultrastructural analyses have provided key insights by revealing membranous connections between viral ROs and their putative membrane donor organelle ( Figure 1 ). The detection of direct membranous continuities between DMVs and the ER points towards a primary role of ER membranes in the formation of ROs induced by nidoviruses [13] [14] [15] 17, 20] , HCV [12] , noroviruses [11, 25] , and cardioviruses [24] . Enterovirus ROs, however, have typically been found as separate compartments lacking connections [8, 9] , which complicates the identification of the donor organelle. Only recently, a study combining live-cell imaging and whole-cell 3D-EM to capture early stages in RO formation revealed that enterovirus ROs originate from both ER and Golgi membranes, which seem to be used in a sequential manner [26] .",

These include the induction of positive and negative curvature, membrane paring, and, depending on the DMV topology, several membrane fission events. These steps can be combined in numerous ways to form a DMV. Consequently, finding structural intermediates is key to elucidating the exact biogenesis path and has been accomplished in some cases. It should be noted, however, that short-lived intermediates may not be captured in EM images and, therefore, the existence of additional rapid DMV biogenesis routes cannot be entirely discarded. Possible intermediates in DMV formation have been clearly identified for several picornaviruses [8] [9] [10] , supporting a mechanism in which single-membrane structures transform into membrane-paired cisternae that subsequently curve and seal to form DMVs (Figure 2 ). The formation of abundant single-membrane structures early in infection is also a characteristic of HCV and norovirus infections [11, 12, 25, 27] , and DMV biogenesis paths similar to that of picornaviruses have been suggested [11, 27, 28] . Different lines of evidence point towards an alternative DMV biogenesis route for nidoviruses, where segments of paired ER membranes progressively bend to form a DMV (Figure 2 ). Putative intermediates in this transformation have been observed in arterivirus-infected cells [29] , and, both for arteriviruses and coronaviruses, in conditions where",

Their functional equivalents in arteriviruses [36] , namely nsp2 and nsp3, have also been shown to be necessary and sufficient for DMV formation [37] . In the case of poliovirus, the most extensively studied of the picornaviruses, a combination of the membrane-associated nonstructural proteins 2BC and 3A seems to be sufficient for the formation of DMVs [38] . Strikingly, protein 3AB even induced the formation of structures resembling DMVs that appeared to form by invagination of liposomes in vitro [39] . For some viruses, expression of a single nonstructural protein is sufficient for the formation of DMVs. This is the case for norovirus NS4 and HCV NS5A, both of which contain an N-terminal amphipathic helix [11, 12] .

In addition to the lack of vRNA synthesis, differences between these structures and native DMVs include their abundance, their morphology, and the absence (or unusual abundance) of other membrane alterations. This indicates that additional factors may have a strong influence on DMV biogenesis. Some studies using expression of polyprotein fragments suggest that expression in the context of a complete viral polyprotein, polyprotein processing, and even the speed of this process can affect DMV formation [31, 40] . Processing intermediates produced in a time-controlled fashion could be important, for example, in favouring interactions between nonstructural proteins that facilitate membrane remodelling. Intriguingly, while HCV DMV formation can be induced by NS5A alone [12] , there is an additional requirement for a functional NS3 helicase domain when expression occurs in the context of an NS3-5B polyprotein [40] . Additional nonstructural proteins frequently assist or modulate DMV formation, as documented for HCV NS4B [28, 41] and NS5B [12] (a highly hydrophobic protein and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively), as well as for the arterivirus nsp5 transmembrane protein [29] . This may also be true of coronavirus nsp6 or norovirus NS1-2 and NS3, which have putative transmembrane helices and have been found to induce proliferation of altered membranes when expressed alone [11, 34] .",

In addition to supporting viral replication more broadly, host factors are also likely essential for RO formation, for example, as lipids or (recruited) protein complexes that act as scaffolds or introduce local asymmetry. While much of the available evidence is suggestive rather than mechanistic, this section discusses those host factors thought to play a role in DMV biogenesis.",

In this regard, canonical membranescaffolding proteins, like the ER-associated reticulons, which have been shown to have an important role in the formation of virus-induced invaginations [46] , are intuitive host-factor candidates that may contribute to DMV formation. Although the role of reticulons in DMV formation has not been specifically addressed, the association of reticulon 3 with enterovirus 71 (EV-71) protein 2C appears to promote enterovirus infection [47] . Intriguingly, both pro-and anti-replicative effects of reticulon 3 during HCV infection, presumably mediated by its interaction with HCV NS4B, have been reported [48, 49] . Another host protein with canonical roles in membrane remodelling is the F-BAR domain-containing proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 2 (PSTPIP2). While abolishing the interaction between HCV NS4B/NS5A and PSTPIP2 limited DMV formation, viral replication reduced correspondingly [50] . In many cases it is difficult to establish whether reduced levels of DMV formation are a cause or consequence of reduced levels of replication under intervention. Indeed, given the multifaceted function of many host factors, and their requirement for viral replication, untangling specific roles across infection is often challenging and may require the use of systems where protein expression is uncoupled from viral replication.",

Interestingly, the autophagy marker LC3 has been found to colocalize with viral replicase proteins for a number of DMV-inducing viruses [51] [52] [53] [54] . Nevertheless, the significance of this association and, more broadly, the specific involvement of (canonical) autophagy in DMV formation, remains unclear. For HCV, the early steps of autophagy have been suggested to be involved in DMV biogenesis. ATG5 has been strongly implicated in HCV replication [54, 55] , and limiting the formation of ATG5-12 conjugates during infection resulted in the formation of fewer and smaller viral DMVs [55] . A role has also been suggested for the early-acting autophagy protein DFCP1 [54, 56] , while inhibiting the recruitment or components of the ATG14L autophagosome initiation complex was found to reduce DMV numbers [57] .",

Unlike LPL, phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major structural component of secretory pathway membranes. Its biosynthesis and regulators thereof have been shown to be crucial for the replication of enteroviruses, cardioviruses, and HCV [71] [72] [73] , where it may serve to support the expansion of suitable membranes for DMV formation. Indeed, enterovirus DMV formation was severely impaired under conditions where PC biosynthesis was limited [73] .

Strictly speaking, this question could be extended to other types of viral ROs, as many of the proposed RO functions are based on rational speculation rather than on direct evidence. Answering this question may ultimately require comparison with systems in which virus replication can occur without (typical) ROs, which are understandably rare. A remarkable example is that of a mutant CVB3 enterovirus that, in the exponential phase of vRNA synthesis, can replicate its genome in the absence of ROs, using instead morphologically intact Golgi membranes [24] . Together with evidence that replication can be redirected to alternative platforms for some +RNA viruses that induce invaginations [77, 78] , this underlines that the core requirements for replication are not always tied to specific membrane compartments. Interestingly, this delay in enterovirus RO formation did not seem to induce accelerated sensing of vRNA or an enhanced innate immune response during one cycle of viral replication, challenging the idea that ROs may be critical in shielding vRNA from cellular sensors of the innate immune system. A subsequent study on poliovirus showed that, under conditions where RO formation may be more severely impaired, recognition of vRNA by a cellular sensor can be enhanced, though it may take several replication cycles to generate an antiviral response that translates to reduced virus propagation [73] .",

The mechanistic details involved, and even the specific contribution of the ROs to this phenomenon, are unclear; however, components of the nuclear transport machinery, some of which are found in HCV RO regions [80] , appear to play key roles in the observed segregation of immune sensors and ROs. Along similar lines, several studies with different DMV-inducing viruses indicate that (intact) ROs have a vital function in shielding vRNA from RNase access or from immunodetection [21, 23, [81] [82] [83] making it plausible that this protective function could also serve to conceal viral replication intermediates from cellular sensors. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether this effect depends on specific RO morphologies. Unlike the spherules induced by other +RNA viruses, which define compartments that are relatively isolated from the cytosol, all the membrane structures induced by DMV-inducing viruses represent large exposed surfaces that could be vulnerable to sensing. For these viruses, the concept that the morphology of their ROs is adapted to shield vRNA is less intuitive. In this respect, picornavirus-induced singlemembrane structures, which are proven active sites of vRNA synthesis and predominate at the peak of replication [8] [9] [10] , probably represent the most challenging example. Here, the cytosol-facing replication complex must associate with an exposed RO surface, which defies the idea of compartmentalization as a general RO mechanism to conceal viral replication intermediates and suggests alternative evasion strategies, for example, through shielding by the viral replication machinery.",

Such a compartment, Trends in Microbiology however, should remain capable of exchanging material with the cytosol in order to import metabolites and export the positive-sense vRNA products for translation and encapsidation into progeny virions. In a virus-induced spherule, the neck-like channel that connects it with the cytosol appears to serve this purpose. By contrast, closed DMVs without apparent openings to the surrounding cytosol have regularly been observed in infected cells (Figure 1 ). For HCV and picornaviruses, these coexist with open DMVs, which are likely their precursors [8] [9] [10] 12] . It is thus conceivable that productive vRNA synthesis occurs inside open DMVs that eventually become sealed, perhaps to hide an excess of vRNA accumulated throughout infection. Alternative functions of these DMVs have also been proposed. Recent studies suggest that some viruses may be able to transfer the DMV content to other cells, using mechanisms such as extracellular vesicles or nanotubes [84] [85] [86] . This content potentially includes genomic RNA, which would be sufficient to initiate an infection if delivered into a na\u00efve cell. In the case of enteroviruses, where some DMVs appear to contain progeny virions, DMVs have been linked to en bloc transmission of mature virions [84] , which could increase the likelihood of a viable infection if complementary viral quasispecies are exported together. These mechanisms could confer an additional benefit by facilitating viral propagation in a manner that eludes antibody neutralization.",

DMVs are sites of vRNA replication for HCV [23] , appear to be the major replication platform for coronaviruses [17, 22] , and a substantial support for vRNA replication in picornaviruses [9, 10, 24] , demonstrating that these structures possess the minimum requirements to serve as replication membranes. While it is currently unclear whether the roles of DMVs are conserved across these viruses, and how critical DMVs are for effective viral propagation, these remain vital questions as demand for broad-acting antivirals remains high and viral ROs constitute a largely unexplored target [88] [89] [90] . Our understanding of the additional membrane structures commonly found alongside DMVs also remains incomplete. If and how these diverse morphologies arise from a single membrane origin, and what their functional significance might be, remain fascinating open questions. An important conceptual distinction exists between virus-induced membrane structures that support viral genome replication and those that do not. Indeed, our definition of the viral RO may evolve as our understanding of replication membranes versus alternative membrane structures and functions advances (see Outstanding Questions). Further identifying and investigating host factors will play an important part in determining the roles of these structures and the compositional divergences that allow different morphologies to arise. To this end, effective methods for host factor discovery, including proximity labelling [91] and lipidomic approaches [92] , will be increasingly valuable. These investigations can be complemented with powerful imaging approaches such as cryoelectron tomography and sub-tomogram averaging, which can be used to reveal details",

The protocol used in (A) results in poor membrane preservation, and the DMV morphology is difficult to interpret. In (B), both DMV membranes are readily visible, though large artefactual gaps between the inner and outer membrane are present. In general, chemically fixed DMVs are deformed and only roughly spherical. (C,D) Examples of cryo-fixed DMVs induced by SARS-coronavirus (C, fixed by plunge freezing)",

In most cases, these connections are established with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but nidoviral DMVs are also interconnected and connected to other virus-induced membrane structures. For noroviruses the open/closed state of DMVs is unreported, indicated by broken lines. The outer ring depicts additional virus-induced membrane structures.

Through membrane pairing, these structures form cisternae that curve (inducing positive and negative curvature at the outer and inner membrane, respectively) to finally seal and transform into a closed DMV. This mechanism is supported by intermediate structures found in picornavirus infections",
