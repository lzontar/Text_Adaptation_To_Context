Sesbania cannabina as a close relative of the plant pathogen Rhizobium radiobacter (syn. Agrobacterium tumefaciens). However, DNA:DNA hybridization with R. radiobacter, R. rubi, R. vitis and R. huautlense gave only 44%, 5%, 8% and 8% similarity respectively, suggesting that IRBG74 is potentially a new species. Additionally, it contained no vir genes and lacked tumour-forming ability, but harboured a sym-plasmid containing nifH and nodA genes similar to those in other Sesbania symbionts. Indeed, IRBG74 effectively nodulated S. cannabina and seven other Sesbania spp. that nodulate with Ensifer (Sinorhizobium)/ Rhizobium strains with similar nodA genes to IRBG74, but not species that nodulate with Azorhizobium or Mesorhizobium. Light and electron microscopy revealed that IRBG74 infected Sesbania spp. via lateral root junctions under flooded conditions, but via root hairs under non-flooded conditions. Thus, IRBG74 is the first confirmed legume-nodulating symbiont from the Rhizobium (Agrobacterium) clade. Crossinoculation studies with various Sesbania symbionts showed that S. cannabina could form fully effective symbioses with strains in the genera Rhizobium and Ensifer, only ineffective ones with Azorhizobium strains, and either partially effective (Mesorhizobium huakii) or ineffective (Mesorhizobium plurifarium) symbioses with Mesorhizobium. These data are discussed in terms of the molecular phylogeny of Sesbania and its symbionts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Sesbania is a genus of approximately 60 species of tropical legume of which 40 have so far been reported to nodulate (Sprent, 2001) . Many species occur naturally in wet or flooded soils and these have considerable potential as green manure in wetland rice production due to their ability to fix large quantities of N 2 (James et al., 2001 and references therein) . Sesbania nodules may be induced by a variety of rhizobia, including Azorhizobium spp. (Dreyfus et al., 1988; Gon\u00e7alves and Moreira, 2004; Moreira et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2008) , Ensifer spp. (syn. Sinorhizobium spp.) (De Lajudie et al., 1994; Boivin et al., 1997; Chen and Lee, 2001; Sharma et al., 2005) , Mesorhizobium spp. (McInroy et al., 1999; Bala et al., 2002; Odee et al., 2002; Vinuesa et al., 2005) and Rhizobium spp. (Rana and Krishnan, 1995; Wang et al., 1998; Wang and Mart\u00ednez-Romero, 2000; Chen and Lee, 2001; Bala et al., 2002; Sharma et al., 2005; Vinuesa et al., 2005) . In addition to the 'standard' rhizobial types, strains of the genus Agrobacterium (which are now, rather controversially, included in the genus Rhizobium; Young et al., 2001; Farrand et al., 2003) have also been isolated frequently from Sesbania nodules (Tan et al., 2001; Bala et al., 2002; Odee et al., 2002) . The present study concerns one of these, Rhizobium strain IRBG74, isolated from root nodules of Sesbania cannabina (Retz.) Pers. (Biswas et al., 2000) . This strain has been used to promote the growth of rice, as one of a group of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (Biswas et al., 2000) . On the basis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence, it is most closely related to the plant pathogen Rhizobium radiobacter (syn Agrobacterium tumefaciens) (Tan et al., 2001) . Biswas and colleagues (2000) tagged IRBG74, isolated from rice roots, with a gusA reporter gene and found that it not only expressed gus activity on plates containing X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-Dglucuronic acid), but could also nodulate S. cannabina. Although plant growth was strongly promoted, both acetylene reduction and 15 N isotope dilution assays found no activity associated with rice roots (Biswas et al., 2000) . On the other hand, using both PCR and Southern hybridization, Tan and colleagues (2001) detected a nifH gene in IRBG74, one of the components required for nitrogenase production. Although some rhizobia occasionally express nitrogenase activity in culture, only the genus Azorhizobium (Dreyfus et al., 1988; Moreira et al., 2006) and some nodulating species of Burkholderia (Elliott et al., 2007) can grow on the products of nitrogen fixed ex planta. There are many reports of isolation of agrobacteria from nodules, but few have established whether or not these strains are capable of inducing nodules, and even if they can, whether or not the nodules are effective in fixing nitrogen.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 117, "end": 131, "text": "(Sprent, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 320, "end": 363, "text": "(James et al., 2001 and references therein)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 452, "end": 474, "text": "(Dreyfus et al., 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 475, "end": 503, "text": "Gon\u00e7alves and Moreira, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 504, "end": 525, "text": "Moreira et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 526, "end": 543, "text": "Lee et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 585, "end": 610, "text": "(De Lajudie et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 611, "end": 631, "text": "Boivin et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 632, "end": 651, "text": "Chen and Lee, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 652, "end": 672, "text": "Sharma et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 694, "end": 716, "text": "(McInroy et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 717, "end": 735, "text": "Bala et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 736, "end": 754, "text": "Odee et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 755, "end": 776, "text": "Vinuesa et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 796, "end": 821, "text": "(Rana and Krishnan, 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 822, "end": 840, "text": "Wang et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 841, "end": 872, "text": "Wang and Mart\u00ednez-Romero, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 873, "end": 892, "text": "Chen and Lee, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 893, "end": 911, "text": "Bala et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 912, "end": 932, "text": "Sharma et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 933, "end": 954, "text": "Vinuesa et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1131, "text": "Young et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1153, "text": "Farrand et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1229, "text": "(Tan et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1248, "text": "Bala et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1267, "text": "Odee et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1420, "text": "(Biswas et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1559, "text": "(Biswas et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1727, "text": "(Tan et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1758, "text": "Biswas and colleagues (2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2142, "end": 2163, "text": "(Biswas et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2228, "end": 2253, "text": "Tan and colleagues (2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2450, "end": 2472, "text": "(Dreyfus et al., 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2473, "end": 2494, "text": "Moreira et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2561, "text": "(Elliott et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The species R. radiobacter (Young et al., 2001) now includes the two former agrobacteria, Agrobacterium radiobacter (avirulent) and A. tumefaciens (tumour forming) (Willems, 2006) . Although in the laboratory sym genes have been mobilized into R. radiobacter and the recipient strain was able to form N 2-fixing nodules on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) (Mart\u00ednez et al., 1987) , there is little published evidence that any Agrobacterium or Agrobacterium-like strains can fix nitrogen in the wild, even if they induce nodulation (De Lajudie et al., 1999; Mhamdi et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006) .

All four species examined, i.e. S. cannabina (Fig. 3A ), S. bispinosa (Fig. 3B ), S. rostrata (Fig. 3C ) and S. sesban (Fig. 3D ), showed clear evidence of root colonization by IRBG74GUS by 7 dai with particularly intense staining at lateral root junctions (e.g. Fig. 3A , C and D).

Both WT and GUS-tagged strains induced visible nodules on S. cannabina by 15 dai ( Fig. 3E and F); the WT (control) strain showed no blue staining after treatment with X-Gluc (Fig. 3F ).

These bacteria subsequently developed into bacteroids as the host cells expanded ( Fig. 4C and D). Using an antibody raised against pea Lb (Fig. 4D ), which had previously been shown to recognize Lb in N 2-fixing nodules on S. rostrata infected by A. caulinodans (James et al., 1996) , nodules on S. cannabina infected by IRBG74 were shown to contain this O2-carrying protein, which is essential for the functioning of the symbiosis. Functional nodules were not formed on either S. rostrata or S. sesban after inoculation by IRBG74 under non-flooded conditions.

Here, we repeated and extended the analyses of Tan and colleagues (2001) to include additional data (Fig. S1) . A concatenated approach was deployed using two universally conserved protein-coding genes, rpoB and fusA, which are useful alternatives to 16S rRNA sequences in determining the relationship between both divergent and highly related lineages (Santos and Ochman, 2004) . The phylogenetic tree derived from the concatenated sequence matrix under a maximum likelihood approach offered the opportunity to infer a phylogeny based on the total evidence, from which the underlying species tree could be estimated. This tree supports the phylogeny estimated from the 16S rRNA sequence, namely that strain IRBG74 clusters, with high bootstrap support (89%), with three validly described strains of R. radiobacter, including the type strain NCIMB9042. However, the inferred tree does not identify whether IRBG74 is a strain of R. radiobacter or a unique species. To accomplish this, DNA-DNA hybridization, which remains the 'gold standard' to differentiate between these alternatives, was used. Our data demonstrated that against closely related strains of the Rhizobium genus, the DNA-DNA similarity was greatest against two strains of R. radiobacter, NCIMB9042, and NCIMB4034 (a recently described strain that has been used as a PGPR in agricultural systems; Humphry et al., 2007) , although neither of these strains is diazotrophic. Nevertheless, the similarity was significantly lower than the 70% threshold (Wayne et al., 1987) required for designating IRBG74 as a strain of R. radiobacter or, indeed, any of the other species examined. These observations therefore support the inclusion of IRBG74 as a novel species within the R. radiobacter-R. rubi clade, and, to our knowledge, is the first N 2-fixing bacterium to be identified from among these species. However, these data should be interpreted with caution, because there are potential issues (which have yet to be resolved) in using DNA hybridization to circumscribe bacterial species in isolates with large accessory genomes (Young et al., 2006) .

Alignment of the nifH and nodA sequences against homologous genes in GenBank revealed that both were most closely related to homologues present in members of the genus Ensifer, particularly those that had been isolated from Sesbania spp. The nifH gene of IRBG74 showed highest similarity to homologues from E. saheli strain ORS609 (also isolated from S. cannabina; De Lajudie et al., 1994; Boivin et al., 1997) , whereas the nodA gene sequence was most similar to those of E. saheli bv. sesbaniae strain ORS611 and E. terangae bv. sesbaniae (although it did also hybridize with the nodA gene from E. saheli ORS609). The other Rhizobium strains isolated from Sesbania nodules (Ss121, Se127, SIN-1 and DUS1110) also contained nifH and nodA genes that were very similar to those of the Ensifer symbionts, and a phylogenetic relationship between the nifH genes of Rhizobium symbionts of Sesbania and those of E. saheli was previously noted by Vinuesa and colleagues (2005) . It therefore appears that although the core genome of IRBG74 is essentially 'agrobacterial', its accessory symbiosis-related genome is similar to that of a wide range of Rhizobium/Ensifer Sesbania symbionts. Distinct and divergent evolutionary histories between symbiotic and housekeeping genes have been reported in other rhizobia (Vinuesa et al., 2005) . This phenomenon is most likely explained by the high mobility of the plasmidborne genes in Rhizobium and close relatives such as Ensifer (Turner et al., 2002; Bailly et al., 2007) . In the case of Agrobacterium, this mobility has been exemplified in laboratory experiments in which strains have had rhizobial sym plasmids mobilized into them, and the genetically modified Agrobacterium strains thus formed have consequently shown a limited ability to nodulate legumes (Hirsch et al., 1985; Mart\u00ednez et al., 1987; Van de Wiel et al., 1988) . Interestingly, and in spite of the apparent ease with which Agrobacterium can acquire sym genes in the laboratory, fully effective N2-fixing agrobacterial symbioses with legumes had not been demonstrated and/or discovered (Mhamdi et al., 2005; Vel\u00e1zquez et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006) until the present study of strain IRBG74, which is therefore the first confirmed naturally occurring agrobacterial symbiont of legumes to be fully described in both genetical and symbiotic terms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 546, "end": 556, "text": "cannabina;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 557, "end": 581, "text": "De Lajudie et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 582, "end": 602, "text": "Boivin et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1160, "text": "Vinuesa and colleagues (2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1517, "text": "(Vinuesa et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1678, "text": "(Turner et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1699, "text": "Bailly et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1988, "end": 2009, "text": "(Hirsch et al., 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2032, "text": "Mart\u00ednez et al., 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2033, "end": 2058, "text": "Van de Wiel et al., 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2283, "end": 2304, "text": "(Mhamdi et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2305, "end": 2328, "text": "Vel\u00e1zquez et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2329, "end": 2347, "text": "Wang et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Phylogeny of symbiosis-related genes and host range"}, {"text": "Rhizobium strain IRBG74 showed a range of symbiotic phenotypes on the different Sesbania species tested, from no nodulation on S. punicea, through ineffective nodulation on S. herbacea, S. rostrata, S. sesban and S. virgata to effective nodulation on S. bispinosa, S. cannabina, S. exasperata, S. formosa, S. grandiflora, S. madagascariensis, S. macrantha and S. pachycarpa. There appears to be no obvious geographical link between those species that do nodulate and those that do not, other than that all of the Asian Sesbania spp. nodulated effectively. Indeed, our data suggest that symbioti-cally effective N2 fixation is observed only with those species that can also nodulate with Rhizobium or Ensifer. Host range in rhizobia is determined by 'decorations' on the structure of the lipoprotein oligosaccharide 'nod factors' transcribed by the nodulation genes, such as nodA (Sprent, 2001; Kobayashi and Broughton, 2008) , and so it is likely that the host range of IRBG74 (and the other symbionts in this study) is reflected more in its nodA than its core genome phylogeny. The nodA phylogenies suggest that the Rhizobium isolates studied here have acquired their symbiosis-related genes by lateral gene transfer from an Ensifer sp. (Fig. 3B) , with a potential candidate being E. saheli. In the case of IRBG74, this is further supported by the fact that the type strain of E. saheli, ORS609, which was originally isolated from S. cannabina (De Lajudie et al., 1994) , has a similar host range (e.g. it is capable of effectively nodulating many of the Sesbania species tested positive in the present study for symbiotic nodulation with IRBG74, such as S. bispinosa, S. formosa, S. grandiflora and S. pachycarpa; Boivin et al., 1997) . On the other hand, unlike ORS609 (Boivin et al., 1997) , strain IRBG74 was unable to form effective nodules with those Sesbania spp. that establish symbiotic partnerships with azorhizobia (S. rostrata, S. virgata; Table 3 ) and mesorhizobia (S. punicea, S. sesban), thus suggesting that although they share similarities in their nodA sequences, the nod genes of IRBG74 are not identical to those of ORS609.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 879, "end": 893, "text": "(Sprent, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 894, "end": 924, "text": "Kobayashi and Broughton, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1446, "end": 1471, "text": "(De Lajudie et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1717, "end": 1737, "text": "Boivin et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1773, "end": 1794, "text": "(Boivin et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1238, "end": 1247, "text": "(Fig. 3B)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1961, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Phylogeny of symbiosis-related genes and host range"}, {"text": "On the plant side, the host of IRBG74, S. cannabina, has shown a clear preference for symbionts with nodA sequences in the Ensifer-Rhizobium clade, but it also has the ability to nodulate (albeit, only partially effectively) with mesorhizobial strains from Sesbania, such as M. huakuii KFR647. Unfortunately, the sequence of nodA from KFR647 could not be obtained, but its nodD gene sequence was different from the aforementioned Ensifer-Rhizobium clade, and the nodA sequence of M. plurifarium Sp45, which only forms ineffective nodules on S. cannabina, was also distant from this clade, thus lending support to the suggestion that S. cannabina has a preference for Ensifer/Rhizobium symbionts with plasmidborne symbiosis-related genes. On the other hand, S. cannabina may not be typical in this respect, as other studies of Sesbania have demonstrated that both mesorhizobial and (sino)rhizobial symbionts are found within the same species, e.g. in S. sericea (Vinuesa et al., 2005) and S. sesban (Bala et al., 2002; Sharma et al., 2005) . Of the two species that are known to nodulate with Azorhizobium, S. rostrata appears to be more capable of forming effective symbioses with other rhizobia (such as E. saheli and E. terangae; De Lajudie et al., 1994; Boivin et al., 1997) , than S. virgata, which seems to be capable of forming effective symbioses only with A. doebereinerae (Gon\u00e7alves and Moreira, 2004; this study) . Sesbania punicea also appears to be highly conservative in its choice of symbiont, as evidenced by the lack of nodulation with IRBG74 (this study) or even with the other mesorhizobial strain from S. sesban, M. huakuii KFR647 (E.K. James, unpubl. data) , and the data so far obtained about this species suggest that it can nodulate only with M. plurifarium (Vinuesa et al., 2005) . Interestingly, the highly selective nature of S. virgata and S. punicea with regard to symbionts in comparison with other Sesbania spp. was illustrated by a rhizobial soil 'trapping' study in Brazil in which they were the only Sesbania spp. that failed to nodulate in uninoculated soils (Veasey et al., 1997) .

However, the crack entry infection process via adventitious roots that leads to the initial formation of aerial stem nodules on S. rostrata has also been observed in flooded roots of this species (Ndoye et al., 1994; Goormachtig et al., 2004) and S. bispinosa (Rana and Krishnan, 1995) , and it also probably occurs on the other hydrophytic Sesbania spp. regardless of the type of rhizobial symbiont. The present study of Rhizobium (Agrobacterium) sp. IRBG74 suggests that a crack entry infection probably occurs with S. cannabina under flooded conditions, whereas under non-flooded conditions, as in S. rostrata (Goormachtig et al., 2004) , it nodulates via a 'standard' root hair infection pathway. It remains to be seen if the other Sesbania spp. in this study also switch from crack entry under flooded conditions to root hair infection under the non-flooded conditions described by Goormachtig and colleagues (2004) for S. rostrata.

Although this is by no means the first report of a non-pathogenic Agrobacterium strain being isolated from nodules (e.g. Mhamdi et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006) , the fact that IRBG74 possesses a sym-plasmid with symbiosis-specific genes (e.g. nodA) and can effectively nodulate its original host and fix N2 to the benefit of the growth of the plant to the same degree as 'conventional' rhizobia, is a novel observation. Indeed, it could be argued that despite its core genome being that of Agrobacterium (Tan et al., 2001;  this study), IRBG74 behaves in all respects (including its infection processes) like typical legume-nodulating rhizobia, and thus supports the recent decision to incorporate all Agrobacterium strains into the genus Rhizobium (Young et al., 2001) . It is likely that as further rhizobia are isolated from more legumes, particularly those in the tropics, the incidence of potentially genuine symbiotic 'Agrobacterium' isolates will increase (e.g. see Bala et al., 2002) . This is also the first study to compare a nodulation gene (in this case, nodA) within a range of Sesbania symbionts. The nodA gene phylogeny, which groups the bacteria into three distinct clades (ie. Azorhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium [Agrobacterium]/E. saheli), also appears linked to these microsymbionts' host range. Indeed, the present study, together with data from previous published work, have indicated three definable 'groups' of Sesbania spp. in terms of their propensity to nodulate with symbionts harbouring particular nodA gene types. Groups 1 and 2 consist of only one species each, i.e. the two South American species, S. punicea and S. virgata, which both have a high specificity for a very narrow range of symbionts (M. plurifarium and A. doebereinerae respectively) harbouring nodA sequences that are very different from each other and from the other Sesbania symbionts examined in the present study. Group 3, on the other hand, is a large group that contains several non-selective ('promiscuous') species that can nodulate with a wide range of symbionts in the Rhizobium [Agrobacterium]/E. saheli clade harbouring similar nodA genes (as well as, in some cases, with M. huakuii and A. caulinodans). The species in Group 3 include S. cannabina and S. sesban, and given their ability to nodulate effectively with strain IRBG74 (this study) and/or S. saheli ORS609 (Boivin et al., 1997) , probably also include S. exasperata, S. formosa, S. grandiflora, S. macrantha and S. pachycarpa. This group also includes S. herbacea, the original source of R. huautlense (Wang et al., 1998) , but which can also nodulate with Mesorhizobium strains and IRBG74 (Wang and Mart\u00ednez-Romero, 2000 ; this study), and S. sericea, which, along with S. cannabina and S. exasperata, nodulates with R. huautlense strains (Vinuesa et al., 2005) . Although both the Group 1 and 2 species are South American in origin, the three nodulation groups appear to be independent of geography, as other South America spp. are present in Group 3 (e.g. S. exasperata) and, indeed, the Group 3 species come from all parts of the tropical world. This therefore leaves open the possibility that the nodulation preferences (and nodA types) are actually linked to plant phylogeny, and this is demonstrated by a tree inferred from nrDNA Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 and 2 sequences of several Sesbania spp., including all those used in the present study (Fig. 5 ). This preliminary study has shown that although the genus is monophyletic (F.T. Farruggia, unpublished), it contains two distinct clades that appear to match the symbiont preference/nodA groups described above. For example, both the selective species, S. punicea and S. virgata, are present in one of the clades, whereas all the promiscuous species and/or those species that can nodulate with IRBG74 and other members of the Rhizobium [Agrobacterium]/E. saheli nodA group of Sesbania symbionts are in the other clade. Further studies of nod genes of symbionts from other members of the 60 plus species in the genus should confirm if the heterogeneity in symbiont preference is, indeed, linked to the molecular phylogeny of Sesbania.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 48, "end": 73, "text": "Tan and colleagues (2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 489, "end": 509, "text": "Mhamdi et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 510, "end": 528, "text": "Wang et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 873, "end": 891, "text": "(Tan et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 892, "end": 892, "text": "", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1138, "text": "(Young et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1360, "text": "Bala et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2750, "end": 2771, "text": "(Boivin et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2946, "end": 2965, "text": "(Wang et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 3034, "end": 3065, "text": "(Wang and Mart\u00ednez-Romero, 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 3184, "end": 3206, "text": "(Vinuesa et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3799, "end": 3806, "text": "(Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Concluding remarks: is there a plant phylogenetical component to nodulation of Sesbania by different symbionts?"}, {"text": "All strains used in this study (Table 1) were routinely grown in yeast mannitol broth (YMB; Vincent, 1970) .
