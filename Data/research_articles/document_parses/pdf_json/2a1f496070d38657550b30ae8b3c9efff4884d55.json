            "text": "Newly emerging pandemics like COVID-19 call for better predictive models to implement early and precisely tuned responses to their deep impact on society. Standard epidemic models provide a theoretically well-founded description of dynamics of disease incidence. For COVID-19 with infectiousness peaking before and at symptom onset, the SEIR model explains the hidden build-up of exposed individuals which challenges containment strategies, in particular, due to delayed epidemic responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, spatial heterogeneity questions the adequacy of modeling epidemic outbreaks on the level of a whole country. Here we show that sequential data assimilation of a stochastic version of the standard SEIR epidemic model captures dynamical behavior of outbreaks on the regional level. Such regional modeling of epidemics with relatively low numbers of infected and realistic demographic noise accounts for both spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. Based on adapted regional models, population level short-term predictions can be achieved. More realistic epidemic models that include spatial heterogeneity are within reach via sequential data assimilation methods.",

            "text": "The evolving spread of the novel coronavirus in Germany [1] resulted in containment measures based on reduced traveling and social distancing [3] . In epidemic standard models [2, 14] , which provide a dynamical description of epidemic outbreaks [7, 20] , containment measures aim at a reduction of the contact parameter. Since the contact parameter is one of the critical parameters that determine the speed of increase of the number of infectious individuals, estimation of the contact parameter is a key basis of epidemic modeling [17] . The current situation of COVID-19 is characterized by extreme spatial heterogeneity [1] . In the initial phase of the outbreak, this heterogeneity is caused by random travel-based imports of infectious cases and enhanced by local events with increased contacts. As a consequence, the assumption of homogeneous mixing must be relaxed [12] and coupled dynamics of regional models seem to be a more adequate description [15] . However, when modeling a relatively small region with population size N = 10 5 compared to the country level with N = 10 7 to 10 9 , demographic stochasticity [9, 12] must be addressed (see The stochastic SEIR model). The combination of dynamical modeling with substantial fluctuations calls for sequential data assimilation methods for parameter inference [5, 19] . We investigate the stochastic SEIR epidemic model [2] for application to regional data of COVID-19 incidence. The model assumes S, E, I, and R compartments representing susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals (Fig. 1) . This model is particularly important for the description of the spread of COVID-19, since infectiousness seems to peak on or before symptom onset S E I R !SI aE gI Figure 1 : The SEIR model. The population is composed of four compartments that represent susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals. The contact parameter \u03b2 is critical for disease transmission, 1/a and 1/g are the average duration of exposed and infectious periods, resp. Different from the standard model, birth and death processes are neglected for the short-term simulations discussed throughout the current study. [13] , such that models without the exposed compartment cannot adequately address the time-delay between build-up of exposed and infectious individuals.",

Therefore, the time-dependent contact parameter \u03b2 is the most critical parameter that needs to be determined via data assimilation [19] . The contact parameter \u03b2 is directly related to the basic reproductive rate R 0 in a SEIR-type model (see SEIR model and basic reproductive rate). Therefore, non-pharmaceutical interventions that aim at R 0 < 1 translate into the relation \u03b2 < g in the model. In the following, we will use a combination of sequential data assimilation and stochastic modeling on the regional level to estimate spatial heterogeneity in epidemics spread and show how to use such a combined approach for epidemics prediction and uncertainty quantification.",

An approximative instantaneous negative log-likelihood L(t k , \u03b2) of the contact parameter \u03b2 at observation time t k is obtained from the ensemble Kalman filter (see Model inference based on sequential data assimilation). Thus, by determining the minimum of L(t k , \u03b2) with respect to \u03b2 at time t k we estimate the time-dependence of the best fit \u03b2 * (t k ) (Fig. 2c) . The black line reports the average time dependence for all 320 regions included in the analysis; standard deviations are indicated by the grey area. Results for the two example regions are given by their corresponding colors. The non-pharmaceutical interventions in the spread of COVID-19 were implemented at slightly varying points in time across Germany. In the majority of regions, closings of schools and other educational institutions started on March 16th, while large-scale contact bans was implemented on March 22th. Since these social distancing measures will have an impact on the contact parameter, we expected to observe a related drop in the contact parameter over time. Before we present a corresponding analysis, it should be made clear that any of these measures cannot produce an immediate effect on the observed cases of infected individuals because of the latency period. To use a reliable estimate of the contact parameter, the related interval should be as long as possible, since sequential data assimilation will need several data points to adapt the model to the data. Therefore, we selected the average value of \u03b2 * (t k ) over the three days from March 17th to March 19th as a pre-intervention value. The average over March 31st to April 2nd is taken as an estimate of the post-intervention value. To analyze the effect across regions, we computed average values \u03b2 pre (March [17] [18] [19] and \u03b2 post (March 31-April 2) of the relevant \u03b2 * (t k ) for all regions. A scatter plot indicated a clear reduction of the numerical value of the contact parameter from \u03b2 pre to \u03b2 post (Fig. 2d) . The reduction is statistical significant (Wilcoxon test, p < 0.01).",

The motivation of the current work was to explore the potential of sequential data assimilation [19] for a regional epidemic model as a forecasting tool. Standard epidemic SEIR-type models implement a compartmental description under the assumption of homogeneous mixing of individuals [2] . More realistic modeling approaches require spatial heterogeneity due to time-varying disease onset times, regionally different contact rates, and the time-dependence of the contact rates due to implementation of containment strategies. However, regional descriptions require models that include effects of demographic stochasticity due to limited population sizes and cases numbers in the region considered [6] . Effects of such statistical fluctuations are inherently reproduced via stochastic versions of the standard epidemic models [9, 12] .",

The drop in mean contact rates from an early (\u03b2 pre , March 17-19) to a later period (\u03b2 post , March 31-April 2) indicated the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We also generated model prediction under two different scenarios. In scenario I, started simulations from April 4th with sampling from the assimilated ensemble as initials conditions and the contact parameter estimated for the post-intervention period (March 29-April 4). In scenario II, we replaced the post-intervention contact parameter by its pre-intervention value (March 15-21). As a results, the two scenarios predict rather different temporal developments (decline of daily new cases for scenario I, and strong increase for scenario II). Therefore, our model predictions suggest that lifting off the current interventions would clear switch the epidemic dynamics to the exponential increase before implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Such predictions can easily be scaled up to the federal state level (Bundesl\u00e4nder) or to the country level; a corresponding predictive model will be potentially quite 6 .

The recent simulation study Li et al. [15] used a similar approach of sequential data assimilation for dynamic epidemic models. However, the deterministic SEIR model was implemented and extended by additional noise assumptions. We proposed the usage of the stochastic SEIR model in the formulation of a master equation [9] which can be simulated exactly and numerically efficiently using Gillespie's algorithm [11] . A more complex spatiotemporal stochastic model has been considered in [4] . Furthermore, the state-parameter estimation in [15] utilises the ensemble Kalman filter directly on an augmented state space [19] . Contrary to that study, we found a direct application of the ensemble Kalman filter to the augmented state space (X, \u03b2) not suitable because of the strongly nonlinear interaction between the model states X and the contact parameter \u03b2. This led us to the two stage approach, as presented in this study, combining the ensemble Kalman filter for state estimation with a likelihood based inference of the contact parameter \u03b2. Our current study was mainly motivated by the methodological problem of a possible contribution from data assimilation to epidemics modeling based on a stochastic SEIR model. There are obvious limitations in our current modeling framework, which we did not address because of the methodological focus. Longer-term predictions (\u223c months) are important, but clearly dependent critically on the estimation of undocumented infections (see Li et al. [15] ). Such hidden infections create, after recovery, an unknown reduction in the number of susceptibles that slows down epidemic dynamics; such an effect is currently not included in our current model. However, it seems compatible with our framework to extend the SEIR model by an additional class of undocumented infected individuals [15] . Another important limitation of these results comes from the simplifying assumption that there is no coupling to neighboring regions. As a consequence, regional differences in the contact parameter might in fact be due to differences in contacts between regions. Introducing couplings between regions [15] could also be integrated in our modeling framework. However, the no-coupling approximation might be realistic in the current situation of social distancing and contact ban. Linking back to the potential of NPI to control COVID19 until vaccination or medicine is available we close with an observation relating to a recent study [8] . Our analyses covered the same time span as Dehning et al. [8] and we also picked up a systematic pattern of contact reduction which we interpret as a weekly cycle (see Statistical modeling of trends and weekly oscillations). Indeed, the dates of the interventions analyzed by Dehning et al. are confounded with day of the week; the three dates refer to three Sundays in March. It is reasonable to assume that in Germany there is much less contact to persons outside the family context on weekends than during working days. Of course, there are also other reasons why certified reports of COVID19 infections are less frequent for weekends. For example, people are more likely to go to their GP on Monday than to the emergency room on Sunday, especially as long as the symptoms are mild. No reason, in our opinion, is a lack of recording at the RKI; the cases reported for the weekend are added on Monday and Tuesday. One advantage of the method proposed here is that we recover effects with comparatively little date at the level of regions, not an entire country. In the absence of a vaccine or of medication, having such an epidemic forcasting tool seems almost like a necessary precondition for selective and optimal timing of tightening and loosening of NPI-based containment measures.",

The corresponding mean of log contact parameters reveals the same oscillation. The negative slopes are compatible with the expectation that a decrease in contact rates causes a decrease in daily cases. These illustrative analyses imply two considerations. If evaluated against statistics of daily cases, obviously containment measures must take the weekly cycle into account and avoid confounds in the design. There are many potential sources for this cycle, some of them possibly quite trivial (e.g., the number of tests carried out). However, if experimental research and statistical modeling can establish that part of these fluctuations are indeed due to reduced contact rates beyond the family context on weekends, then dynamical models may help with the prediction of the timing of tightening and loosening decisions in local contexts. For example, one may consider moving to a three-or fourworkday week for some time, in well-defined contexts, and in targeted regions to facilitate this dynamic.",
