            "text": "Sentiment lexicon plays a vital role in lexicon-based sentiment analysis. The lexicon-based method is often preferred because it leads to more explainable answers in comparison with many machine learning-based methods. But, semantic orientation of a word depends on its domain. Hence, a general-purpose sentiment lexicon may gives sub-optimal performance compare with a domain-specific lexicon. However, it is challenging to manually generate a domain-specific sentiment lexicon for each domain. Still, it is impractical to generate complete sentiment lexicon for a domain from a single corpus. To this end, we propose an approach to automatically generate a domain-specific sentiment lexicon using a vector model enriched by weights. Importantly, we propose an incremental approach for updating an existing lexicon to either the same domain or different domain (domain-adaptation). Finally, we discuss how to incorporate sentiment lexicons information in neural models (word embedding) for better performance.",

Recently, with the issue of growing concern about interpretable and explainable artificial intelligence, domains that require high explainability in sentiment analysis task (eg., health domain and financial domain), lexicon-based sentiment analysis approaches are often preferred over machine-learning-based approaches [12, 13] . However, sentiment lexicons are domain-dependent, a word may convey two different connotations in a different domain. For example, the word high may have a positive connotation in economics (e.g., he has a high salary), and negative connotation in medicine (e.g., he has a high blood pressure). Therefore, general-purpose sentiment lexicon may not give the expected predictive accuracy across different domains. Thus, a lexicon-based approach with domain-specific lexicons are used to achieve better performance [1, 4] .",

Afterwards, one cannot automatically update the lexicon with a new corpus. There are many reasons one would want to update an existing lexicon: (i) the existing lexicon may not contain sufficient number of sentiment-bearing words (i.e., it is limited) and it needs to be extended with a corpus from the same domain with a source corpus; (ii) the language may have evolved (new words and meaning changes) and it is necessary to update the existing lexicon with a new corpus. The new corpus may not be large to enable generation of a new lexicon from scratch.

This basic approach of sentiment lexicon generation forms the basis of the incremental approach proposes in Sect. 2.2. We propose an incremental approach for sentiment lexicon expansion to either the same domain or different domain (domain-adaptation). To illustrate the approaches, assume we have a sentiment lexicon L i generated from a corpus C i (using the approach described in Sect. 2.1). Then, we receive a new batch of corpus C i+1 (of the same or different domain with C i ). The incremental approach aims to generate an updated sentiment lexicon L i+1 that would improve the accuracy of the lexicon L i .",

A naive approach would involve generating distributions of all the words in the new batch (C i+1 ) without creating a new lexicon from it. Such a distribution represents the so-called \"sufficient statistics\" [15] and we can construct lexicon from each set of the distributions. To update L i , the two sets of distributions (from C i and C i+1 ) are first merged and updated lexicon (L i+1 ) is generated using the approach described in Sect. 2.1. However, this approach may be inefficient since we update all the words in the existing lexicon. An enhanced and more efficient approach aims to update only subset of the words in L i whose orientation may have changed. This approach use L i to predict the user's sentiment rating scores on the new labelled corpus C i+1 sentences. If the predicted rating scores are the same with the user's sentiment ratings, we can skip those sentences and only consider those sentences where the predicted rating is significantly different from the user's sentiment rating scores. We extract the words from these sentences (reviews), elaborate the corresponding distribution of sentiment values, merge the distribution with the corresponding subset in the L i and generate a new sentiment lexicon L i+1 .",

Alternatively, we can use L i to predict the user's sentiment rating scores on the new labelled corpus C i+1 sentences. If the prediction accuracy is below some predefined threshold, we can conclude there is a domain shift. After detecting the domain shift, we merge the distribution using a similar approach discussed (in updating using the same corpus) and generate the lexicon.
