[1] [2] [3] It was proposed that the first isolate of the virus should be named the Urbani strain of SARS-associated coronavirus, in memory of Carlos Urbani. 6 Parallel to the progress made in the epidemiology and molecular pathophysiology of SARS, clinicians from Hong Kong, China and other countries reported their experience of treating SARS. It is crucial that SARS is detected in its earliest stages and that therapeutic options are optimized. As the symptoms of the disease may change and laboratory tests and definitions are still limited, SARS remains a major health problem even in a situation of decreasing numbers of infections.",

The physician died 10 days later of severe pneumonia and in the hotel, the infection spread to eight people who had been hotel guests or who had visited people at the hotel. These eight key people then carried the virus to other countries, with outbreaks in Vietnam, 10 Singapore 11-13 and Canada. [14] [15] [16] In Hong Kong, a 26-year-old man who had been at the hotel for a visit developed symptoms of a febrile illness. He was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital on 4 March 2003 and was initially found to have a right upper lobe pneumonia that progressed to bilateral localization. He was treated with nebulized salbutamol and intravenous antibiotics, as a bacterial cause of the pneumonia was presumed. The patient recovered without antiviral or steroidal treatment, but 6 days after his admission, 18 healthcare workers from the same ward also reported signs of an acute febrile illness. 17 Further investigations revealed a total of 156 subjects with a similar clinical picture who were infected and admitted to hospital between 11 and 25 March. These included 69 healthcare workers and 16 medical students who had been at the index ward. The infected individuals had also visited the index ward.",

This patient was also admitted to the index ward at the Prince of Wales Hospital in the same time period. With the initial main symptom of diarrhoea, the patient visited relatives at an apartment complex, and more than 300 residents were infected, with leaky sewage pipes being the most likely route of virus spread. As the floor drains of the bathrooms and kitchens were connected to the sewage pipes, backflow of contaminated aerosol into other apartments via these routes could have transmitted the virus. Also, leaky sewage pipes could have allowed infectious aerosols of faecal material to escape into the narrow light well between the buildings. Although the primary mode of transmission is close contact with virus-contaminated droplets, preliminary studies have suggested that the virus may also be found in large quantities in urine and faeces from infected individuals.",

However, it was reported that only the presence of diabetes mellitus and/or cardiac disease (HR 7.3, 95%CI 3.1-17.4; p < 0.001) was associated with adverse outcome as a whole. 20 Future studies with greater patient numbers will reveal the true SARS mortality and its relation to influenza or bacterial pneumonia mortality, but SARS-related critical illness seems to be very common. 21 Aetiology SARS is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus. [1] [2] [3] The group of coronaviruses is a member of the order of Nidovirales, a group of enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses. They synthesize a 3' co-terminal set of subgenomic mRNAs in infected cells. 22, 23 Coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in humans and domestic animals. 24, 25 Although the novel coronavirus strain has been identified, and significant progress has been reported for the development of a rapid diagnostic test, rapid reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are not widely available. Therefore, early management of suspected SARS cases is based on clinical presentation and epidemiological data of possible contact to patients with known SARS. Other diagnostic procedures include viral isolation and serum antibody tests. However, they cannot be used easily to confirm the diagnosis early in the course of the illness, and are only useful for epidemiological studies or retrospective confirmation. Among the initial patients admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital with SARS, 8 more than 90% were subsequently confirmed to have evidence of infection with the SARSassociated coronavirus by RT-PCR or serum antibody analysis.",

Less common initial symptoms include sore throat, sputum production, coryza, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhoea. 8, 15 Watery diarrhoea has also been found in a subgroup of patients one week after the initial symptoms. This symptom was especially relevant in the cohort of patients infected by the 33-year-old male patient with chronic renal disease undergoing haemodialysis, described above. 28 The clinical course of SARS appears to follow a bi-or triphasic pattern. The first phase, which represents the period of viral replication, is associated with an increasing viral load. Clinically, fever, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms occur, which generally improve after a few days. In phase 2, which represents an immunopathological imbalance, the major findings are the recurrence of fever, oxygen desaturation, and clinical and radiological progression of acute pneumonia. This phase is concomitant with falls in the viral load. The majority of patients respond to treatment in this phase, but about 20% may progress into phase 3. This phase is characterized by an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which commonly necessitates mechanical ventilation. In comparison to adults, SARS seems to be less aggressive in younger children, with no child requiring supplementary oxygen in one case series. 29 ",

A similar normal chest radiograph was also reported for a patient with SARS who developed haemorrhagic-fever-like changes. 32 In another study, the opacities occupied a peripheral or mixed peripheral and axial location in 88% of patients. 33 More distinctive radiographic features of the disease were reported to be the predominant involvement of the lung periphery and the lower zone, in addition to the absence of cavitation, hilar lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusion. 33 During the second week of the disease course, a progression from unilateral focal airspace opacity to either multifocal or bilateral involvement was commonly present. 33 In one study, 12% of the patients developed a spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 20% of patients developed evidence of ARDS over a period of 3 weeks. 28 The incidence of barotrauma in intensive care unit admissions seems to be relatively high, despite low-volume, lowpressure ventilation. CT scan studies did not demonstrate excessive hyperinflation or bullous lung formation. 34 In this respect, high-resolution CT scans (HR-CT) may be useful to detect opacities in patients with normal chest radiographs. Within the HR-CT scans, the most common findings are ground-glass opacification, consolidation, and interlobular interstitial and intralobular septal thickening, with predominant involvement of the periphery and lower lobe. The peripheral alveolar opacities were similar to those found in bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. 34 Radiographical findings were also evaluated in the retrospective case series of 144 patients with SARS in the greater Toronto area. 15 Here, chest radiography on admission showed unilateral and bilateral infiltrates in 46% and 29% of patients, respectively. In 25% of individuals, no changes were found. Thirty-one percent of individuals (45/ 144) had progression of their pulmonary infiltrates while in the hospital, but 15 patients (10%) never developed signs of an infiltrate. Although there was variability in the pattern of the infiltrates (focal, lobar, diffuse), most patients had multifocal opacities, and 3% developed a pneumothorax while in the hospital. 15 In the follow-up study of 75 patients from the community outbreak of SARS pneumonia, 28 the initial chest radiograph was reported to be pathological in 53 (71%) patients. In 37 (49%) patients, involvement was confined to one lung zone, and in 16 (21%) patients it was multizonal. Consolidation or lower-zone infiltrates occurred in 45 (60%) patients. 28 Initial high-resolution CT scans were performed in 33 (44%) patients; 18 (55%) had abnormalities confined to one lobe, while multilobar involvement was seen in 15 (46%). In eight (24%) patients, focal ground-glass opacification was the only type of abnormality, while 12 (36%) patients had consolidation only, and 13 (39%) displayed both types of infiltrates. 28 ",

It was suggested that the case definition of SARS should acknowledge the range of lung pathology associated with this disease. One full autopsy was performed in the study and found atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen. 35 Similar findings were reported in a study on postmortem lung sections from eight patients who died from SARS during the Spring 2003 Singapore outbreak. The predominant pattern of lung injury in all eight cases was diffuse alveolar damage. 36 A further study reported autopsies of three patients who died of SARS. 37 In these post-mortem tissues, pulmonary lesions included bilateral extensive consolidation, desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, localized hemorrhage and necrosis, proliferation and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation of protein and monocytes, hyaline membrane formation, lymphocytes and plasma cells in alveoli, and viral inclusion bodies in alveolar epithelial cells. Massive necrosis of splenic lymphoid tissue and localized necrosis in lymph nodes were also found. Further, signs of systemic vasculitis were present, including oedema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls of the lung, heart, liver, kidney and adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles. There was also thrombosis in small veins and systemic toxic changes, including degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells of the lung, liver, heart, kidney, and adrenal gland. Electron microscopy examination showed clusters of viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, in lung tissue. It was concluded that SARS represents a systemic disease that injures many organs. Overall, the lungs, immune system, and systemic small vessels appeared the main targets of infection. 37",
