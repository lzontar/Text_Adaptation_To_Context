Among them, Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney), 16HBE (human bronchial epithelium), A549 (human alveolar basal epithelium), HeLa (human cervical cancer) and Caco2 (human intestinal carcinoma) cells gradually died while the rest remained in a healthy state. Additionally, a conserved proline-centred \u03b2-coil-\u03b2 motif mutant (SARS-CoV-2-E-4a) plasmid was also tested; this mutant allows more SARS-CoV-E protein transfer to the plasma membrane from the Golgi (Cohen et al., 2011) . A relatively high expression level of 2-E was observed in the susceptible cell lines, while the rest of the cell lines displayed no expression ( Figure 1A , Figure S1 ). The 4a mutant not only improved the 2-E expression level but also caused more severe cell death ( Figure S1 ). Interestingly, all susceptible cells coincided with the vulnerable organs observed clinically in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections (C. et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . 16HBE and Vero E6 cells were selected for further examination, and the latter was transfected with a GFP-tagged plasmid to indicate the expression of 2-E. Imaging assays and video showed that the dying cells exhibited characteristic large bubbles, similar to pyroptotic bodies from the plasma membrane, which resembled the morphological changes in Vero E6 cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1B and C and Video S1). Plasma membrane separation revealed that 2-E protein was translocated to membranes after expression ( Figure 1D ). Flow cytometry showed that the cells expressing 2-E proceeded to the Annexin V and propidium iodide double-positive stage ( Figure 1E ).

First, we transfected a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) with SARS-CoV-2-E plasmids for 24 and 48 h. As shown in Figure 2B and Figure S3 , TNF-\uf061 and IL-6 levels in cells and supernatants were significantly upregulated after transfection, as previously reported in COVID-19 patients (Merad and Martin, 2020) . Second, we treated macrophages with purified 2-E protein and obtained similar enhanced cytokine levels ( Figure 2C ). Given that virus infection is related to innate and adaptive immune responses, it is logical to speculate that host cell damage by 2-E would lead to a secondary inflammatory cascade. To test this hypothesis, we transfected Vero E6 with 2-E plasmids, and 24 h later, the culture supernatant was collected and was used to treat RAW264.7 cells.

H&E staining of lung tissue showed marked inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, pulmonary interstitial hyperemia, hemorrhage, and alveolar collapse. The observed animal phenotype was consistent with COVID-19 patients' lungs, in which the first and most severe lesion signs appeared (Zhang et al., 2020) . In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger an overwhelming inflammatory response, which leads to injuries to multiple organs (Bao et al., 2020; Noris et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020) .

A planar lipid bilayer recording technique was used to assess potential electric signals mediated by 2-E. Typical single-channel currents were captured when the protein was reconstituted in asymmetric 50:500 mM KCl solutions and 3:2 PC/PS lipid membranes at applied potentials of -100 mV to +100 mV ( Figure   4A ). The measured reversal potential (59.25 mV) was very close to the theoretical equilibrium potential of K + , indicating that the 2-E channels were permeable to K + but not to Cl -. By examining the reversal potentials in solutions containing varied concentrations of K + , Na + and Cl -, we found the 2-E channels were also permeable to Na + in the presence of K + and Cl -( Figure 4A and B). In addition, 2-E channels exhibited a much lower permeability to divalent Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ in the presence of K + (Figure 4 A and E). The permeability rank ((PNa + \u2248PK + )\uff0f(PCa 2+ \u2248PMg 2+ )\u22483.0) suggested that 2-E channel possesses a distinct selectivity pattern from classic voltage dependent channels. The pH value on the lumen side of organelles may change after coronavirus infection (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019).

A better understanding of which viral proteins are major risk factors for organ and immune system damage is crucial to develop rationale-based clinical therapeutic strategies. Our study supports that the 2-E channel acts as an \"offensive\" virulence factor carried by SARS-CoV-2, leading to the robust inflammatory responses and rapid cell death. 2-E channels may act either by themselves or via other proteins to increase ion fluxes across the membranes, which changes the ion homeostasis and eventually results in membrane rupture (Feltham and Vince, 2018) . In contrast to exocytosis, a common and mild mechanism for virus release, a large amount of SARS-CoV-2, 2-E and other DAMPs can be released simultaneously because of the sudden cell death induced by 2-E channels. Coincidently, COVID-19 patients' lungs showed evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation, some COVID-19 patients may worsen rapidly to sudden stroke from mild symptoms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 671, "end": 696, "text": "(Feltham and Vince, 2018)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion:"}, {"text": "It has been demonstrated that depletion of intracellular potassium will promote robust secretion of cytokines and aggravate the MLKL channel-mediated necroptosis and GSDMD pore-mediated pyroptosis (Conos et al., 2017; Ding et al., 2016) .

Identification of 2-E as a new type of potassium permeable channels may therefore unravel the pathogenic mechanisms underlying hypokalaemia exacerbating ARDS, which is a common complication in COVID-19 patients (Louhaichi et al., 2020) . In addition to 2-E channels, multiple proteins exhibiting channel activity have been also identified in other highly pathogenic respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Influenza A (Cady et al., 2010; Nieto-Torres et al., 2014; Surya et al., 2015) . Although how these channels modulate the ion homeostasis across the virus membrane remains unclear, it is generally believed that these channels are necessary for the virus production and maturation (Castano-Rodriguez et al., 2018) .

Although the in vivo antiviral activity of the newly identified channel inhibitors needs further studies, their potent antiviral activity in vitro and excellent protection effects against ARDSlike damage in vivo shed light on the drug development of 2-E channel inhibitors.
