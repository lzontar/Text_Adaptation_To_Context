Permissive hypercapnia (PHY) has been suggested as a lung protective ventilatory strategy for adult patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [10] . PHY is a strategy that allows for a degree of hypercapnia providing the arterial pH does not fall below a pre-set minimal value; it may be utilised in combination with a degree of permissive hypoxaemia (usually arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation above 85%) in an eort to minimise mean airway pressure and hence barotrauma. As a result of increasing evidence from the adult literature [11, 14] , this strategy was adopted as part of the treatment regime for ventilated infants with bronchiolitis in our PICU from September 1994 onwards. Our impression has been that this has resulted in longer patient stay without an appreciable decrease in barotrauma or mortality. Given that the number of infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis is likely to increase with the improving survival rate of extremely low birth weight infants, such a strategy may have potential cost implications for future practice. With this in mind we wish to report our experience with the use of PHY on ventilated infants with RSV, to analyse retrospectively its impact in terms of the primary endpoints of pH, pCO 2 and peak ventilator pressure, the secondary endpoints of mortality, length of stay and barotrauma and thus to ascertain if enough evidence is present to warrant a prospective study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 208, "end": 211, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 212, "end": 215, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 379, "end": 383, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 774, "end": 778, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 779, "end": 782, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Guy's PICU is a 16 bed, combined cardiac and general tertiary referral PICU, currently admitting approximately 800 patients per year.

Advocacy for its use in ARDS subsequently appeared in the early part of this decade [11, 14] as a progression from animal models demonstrating the damage in\u00aficted on lungs by overdistension [9, 13] . Until now PHY has been predominantly applied to adult patients with ARDS/acute lung injury, i.e: conditions associated with marked inhomogeneity of lung mechanics. A similar situation may exist in infants with bronchiolitis, where variable degrees of air trapping may co-exist with signi\u00aecant interstitial pneumonitis [7, 15] . Thus, the same ventilatory strategy may be applicable to this group of infants. Our results have failed to show any improvement in outcome through the use of PHY. There was a trend towards increased length of ventilation in the PHY group (7 vs 5 days), a \u00aending which has recently been demonstrated prospectively in adult trauma patients with ARDS [5] . Although retrospective, our patient groups were well matched. Associated conditions such as nosocomial pneumonia and ancillary therapies such as neuromuscular blockade, which have been shown to lengthen days of ventilation [25] , were seen in similar numbers in both groups. A potential shortcoming of this study exists in the use of nitric oxide amongst several PHY patients. Although this did not reach statistical signi\u00aecance (P 0.14), there may have been a clinically signi\u00aecant eect. However, if this is so, it is fair to assume that nitric oxide would allow adequate oxygenation to be achieved at lower mean (and peak) airway pressures resulting in an exaggeration of the pressure dierences between groups, along with barotrauma reduction (type 1 errors) but not necessarily length of ventilation.

To the authors' knowledge, the only other published study looking at the use of PHY exclusively in RSV infants has demonstrated quite dierent \u00aendings from ours. Reda et al [19] have retrospectively shown a signi\u00aecant reduction in barotrauma (7% vs 26%) and length of ventilation (11.5 vs 15 days) in the PHY group, without a signi\u00aecant change in mortality. However several important dierences exist between their control group and the one in the present study. Our control patients were younger (2.5 vs 5 mths), with a reduced mortality (5% vs 10%), lower incidence of barotrauma (5% vs 26%) and a shorter length of ventilation (5 vs 15 days).

Respiratory acidosis may worsen pulmonary hypertension through pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction [24] which is particularly pertinent to the sub-group of patients with bronchiolitis and chronic lung disease.
