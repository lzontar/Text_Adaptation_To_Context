Beyond the spread itself, the outbreak may have far-reaching consequences, 31 negatively affecting the economic development worldwide and posing a series of long-standing 32 social problems 2,3 . There is an urgent need for a global prediction system that can provide 33 scientific guidelines for the World Health Organization and international decision-makers to 34 implement effective containment measures capable of curbing the spread of COVID-19 4 . 35 Researchers worldwide have developed various models with mathematical and statistical 36 methods, including stochastic simulations, lognormal distribution 5 , machine learning, and 37 artificial intelligence 6 . Among them, the susceptible-infectious-removed infectious disease 38 model (SIR) is the most widely used 7-9 . However, this simple model is built under a series of 39 idealized assumptions, which may limit the accuracy and reliability of the prediction. In order 40 to obtain the prediction results with higher credibility, more complex models with fewer 41 assumptions should be developed so as to simulate the actual situations in a more realistic 42 manner 10 . 43 Although it is difficult to establish an accurate epidemiological model describing the 44 spread of a pandemic, the reported global pandemic data contain particular solutions to the 45 mathematical equations incorporated in epidemiological models 3,6 . It is theoretically possible 46 to remedy the defects of prior epidemiological models by introducing the latest pandemic data 47 and hence improve the pandemic prediction 2,4,6 . Based on this idea, we have developed a 48 Global Prediction System of the COVID-19 Pandemic (GPCP) 11 . The system develops a 49 modified version of the SIR model and determines the parameters through historical data 50 fitting 12,13 , which allows it to make targeted predictions for various countries and obtain better 51 prediction results. The first version of GPCP (CPCP-1) can capture the major features of the 52 daily number of confirmed new cases and provides reliable predictions. However, the 53 prediction of GPCP-1 is only valid for one month 11 . 54 .

Large public gatherings, shouting, and marching 135 shoulder to shoulder may have already sown the seeds of the second outbreaks in regions under 136 initial control 19,20 and made it even more difficult to contain the epidemic in regions where the 137 curve is still increasing. The use of tear gas and pepper spray against the protesters may also 138 have produced violent coughing and runny noses, forcing protesters to remove their masks and 139 making the crowds even more susceptible to the virus.

The current mass protests in the 244 United States and other regions of the world could lead to amplified second outbreaks, 245 overlapping the wintertime outbreaks and threatening more lives. This is because the extremely 246 crowded environments facilitate the spread of the virus, leading to high rates of the second 247 attack, as seen in both the 1918 pandemic and the 1957 Asian influenza pandemic 30-32 . 248 If the transmission capacity of the second outbreak increases, it could place a catastrophic 249 burden on the health system and create even more serious social and economic crises. However, 250 if the chain of transmission is cut during the first outbreak, there will be no further outbreak 251 similar to the first wave.
