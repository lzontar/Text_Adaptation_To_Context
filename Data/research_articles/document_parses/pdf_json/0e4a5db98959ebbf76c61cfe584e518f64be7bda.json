Methods We reviewed clinical histories of 276 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and extracted data on patients who met the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 severe/fatal pneumonia and had an acute exacerbation starting with mild or common pneumonia. Results Twenty-four patients were included. Of these, 8% were smokers, 54% had been to Wuhan, and 46% had comorbidities. Before acute exacerbation, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (232.9 \u00b1 88.7) was present, and chest CT scans showed the number of involved lobes was 4 (2-5) and total CT score was 6 (2-8). Following acute exacerbation, patients were likely to have more clinical symptoms (p < 0.01) and abnormal laboratory changes (p < 0.01). The number of involved lobes and CT score after an exacerbation significantly increased to 5 (5-5) and 12 (9-14), respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that, when the cutoff value of CT score was 5, the sensitivity and specificity for severe pneumonia were 90% and 70%, respectively. CT findings of ground glass opacity with consolidations (91.7%), bilateral distribution (100.0%), and multifocal lesion (100.0%) were features in found in patients after exacerbation. Conclusions There are significant changes in clinical, laboratory, and CT findings in patients from disease onset to exacerbation. An increase in the number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict poor clinical outcomes. Combining an assessment of CT changes with clinical and laboratory changes could help clinical teams evaluate the prognosis.

Although a positive PCR result is considered to be the diagnostic golden standard to confirm COVID-19 pneumonia outside the Hubei province in China, chest CT also plays an irreplaceable role in aiding diagnosis, evaluating the severity, and even predicting poor clinical outcome. Apart from radiological characteristics, clinical and laboratory changes could be found. In our study, the average age of patients who had a history of exacerbation was older, and a high proportion had comorbidities. This suggests that age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcome. This study provides information on the epidemiology of the COVID-19 patients in Hunan province with severe disease, approximately half of whom had a history of visiting Wuhan. This might be related to susceptibility of patients rather than the history of their visiting Wuhan. Compared with symptoms in patients before exacerbation, symptoms, including dyspnoea and respiratory distress, were more common after exacerbation. Thus, increasing dyspnoea and respiratory distress should alert physicians to identify patients with exacerbations timeously. Other factors such as worsened laboratory parameters including elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased albumin, and shortened activated partial thromboplastin time were noted in patients after exacerbation.
