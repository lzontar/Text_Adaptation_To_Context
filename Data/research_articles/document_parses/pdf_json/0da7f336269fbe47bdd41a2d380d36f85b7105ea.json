For instance, among our predictors of interest were participants' sexual behaviors and mental health/substance use. Yet, participants' sexual behaviors and mental health/substance may have shifted in response to COVID-19 preventive measures such as physical distancing, isolation, and quarantine, along with other changes such as loss of income, new caretaking roles, and stress about potential health impacts of COVID-19. Additionally, our goal was to understand how predictors identified from our qualitative work related to uptake of HIVprevention and behavioral health services. Yet, clinics across MDC have been announcing that in-person HIV-prevention or behavioral health services were to be discontinued or limited in many cases, creating new barriers to accessing this type of care. Beyond this, even for clinics that continued to be open for in-person services, it is unclear if engaging would currently be an optimal health behavior, given the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and local \"stay at home\" orders.",

Through correspondence initiated by the CLaRO PI (Behar-Zusman), we began discussing whether and how to continue our health disparities research and if continuing, how to account for behavior changes and stressors participants may be experiencing related to COVID-19.

Following the development of the initial measure, we distributed and received feedback from over 20 colleagues representing diverse academic training, scientific areas of study, and professional affiliations, including clinical health psychology, nursing studies, public health sciences, prevention science, education and human development, and cognitive/behavioral neuroscience. Contributors to the measure included experts in health disparities and underserved populations (e.g., sexual and gender minorities, Latinx populations, Haitian populations, justice-involved individuals), HIV treatment and prevention, mental health, and substance abuse. Feedback from colleagues was iteratively incorporated, with the goal of capturing a broad range of behavior changes and psychosocial impacts, while at the same time being inclusive of population-specific factors.",

The second item asks individuals to rate the overall degree to which COVID-19 has impacted their daily life, \"How much is/did COVID-19 (coronavirus) impact your day-to-day life?\" rated on a 5-point scale. Finally, participants are asked to report the psychosocial impact of COVID-19, \"Which of the following are you experiencing (or did you experience) during COVID-19 (coronavirus)?\" with a checklist of items pertaining to emotional distress, substance use, sexual behavior, financial stress, stigma, and support. With support from two NIH-funded centers at UM (CLaRO and CHARM), we then translated the measure to Spanish, using a 3-step forward-translation, back-translation and check for equivalent meaning of the original English and back-translated English versions.
