            "text": "We have developed assays for the relevant functional integral membrane proteins, including SecY protein. Current concepts of the interplay of these proteins to facilitate protein secretion and membrane assembly will be discussed. The folding and assembly of influenzahemagglutinin (HA) is a rate-limiting step in transport of HA from the ER1*2. Unfolded HA molecules are associated with BiPl, a cellular ER protein that has been shown to correspond to the glucose-regulated protein GRP783,4. Observations that BiP binds transiently to a variety of wild-type membrane and secretory proteins, and more permanently to malfolded proteins that are trapped in the ER, has led to the hypothesis that BiP plays a role in folding in the ER lumen. Cloning and sequencing of cDNAs encoding mammalianM and yeast7v8 BiPs has demonstrated that BiP is a member of the HSP70 protein family. The yeast BiP gene is essential for cell viability'~~, and like its mammalian counterpart can be induced by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER8*'. We have now investigated the nature of the recognition of nascent HA polypeptides by BiP and have identified a species that appears to be a transient BiP-HA heterodimer. Analysis of the interaction of BiPwith HA mutants that lackvarious structural domains has demonstrated that BiP binds to amino acid sequences that in the folded HA molecule form the trimeric stalk domain. Our current working hypothesis is that BiP stabilizes folding intermediates by binding to exposed hydrophobic structures. BiP is displaced when these hydrophobic structures become buried upon folding of the protein into its correct tertiary or quaternary conformation, or upon formation of malfolded aggregates.",

The specificity of the vesicle targetting reaction must be high to maintain the orderly flow of material in the cell. Ten SEC gene products are required for the post-Golgi stage of the yeast secretory pathway, but are not required for earlier vesicular transport events. Therefore, these genes may encode proteins which maintain the specificity of transport to the cell surface. One of them, SEC4, encodes a GTP-binding protein. Pulse-chase studies (1) have shown that the Sec4 protein goes through a cycle of localization; it is synthesized as a soluble protein, then binds rapidly to the surface of secretory vesicles which subsequently fuse with the plasma membrane.",

Sitedirected mutagenesis studies suggest that the cycle of localization may be obligatorily coupled to a cycle of binding and hydrolysis of GTP (2) . Biochemical studies on purified Sec4 protein imply that additional proteins are necessary to control the exchange of GTP onto Sec4, the hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide and the attachment of Sec4 protein to vesicles. SEC4 displays strong genetic interactions with several of the late acting SEC genes including SEC2 and SECl5 (3) . The Secl5 protein is 105 kD and is peripherally associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Overproduction of Secl5 inhibits cell growth and leads to the formation of a patch of Secl5 protein and a cluster of secretory vesicles (4). The ability of Secl5 to form a protein patch upon overproduction is dependent on the function of Sec2 and Sec4, but not on the function of the other late acting SEC gene products. Sec15 may normally act in conjunction with Sec2 to dock secretory vesicles bearing Sec4 onto the plasma membrane, thereby maintaining the specificity of the exocytotic fusion reaction.",

In vps mutants, the Golgi-modified precursor form of CPY is secreted from the mutant cells. Toward a molecular understanding of the roles VPS gene products play in this transport event, we have cloned and sequenced five of the VPS genes. Results obtained with two of these, VPSlS and VPS33, have suggested that protein phosphorylation may play a role in the regulation of this process. Mutations in either of these two genes lead to severe defects in the sorting of CPY as well as other vacuolar proteins. Mutant alleles of both VPS15 and VPS33 genes that result in a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype have been isolated.

These studies have shown that the Vps33p is a phosphoprotein and its phosphorylation appears to be dependent on the presence of a functional VPS15 gene. Together, these observations indicate that sorting and/or transport of at least some vacuolar proteins may be regulated by the specific phosphorylation (activation) of components of the sorting machinery. We are attempting to test this hypothesis directly using an in vitro transport assay that reconstitutes a late step in the sorting of precursor CPY to the vacuole.",

Stevens, Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 Proteins destined for delivery to the yeast lysosome-like vacuole transit the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Our work has focused on dissecting the assembly pathway of the yeast vacuole and understanding the mechanism of targeting of vacuolar proteins. Using a mutational approach we have identified a small protein domain on carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) that is essential for the targeting of this protein to the vacuole. Mutational analysis indicates that four contiguous residues, Gln*Arg*Pro*Leu. are critically important for the functioning of the CPY vacuolar targeting signal. To identify the CPY sorting receptor we have isolated mutations that compensate for the CPY missorting mutations (eg. Gln-Lys). At least one of these extragenic suppressors is allele specific (ie. suppresses Gln-Lys. but not Pro-Arg). and is thus a good candidate for a mutation giving rise to a CPY sorting receptor with altered binding specificity.",

To directly test this hypothesis we have cloned the structural gene IvAT2) for the 60 kD Hf-ATPase subunit, and constructed vat2 null mutants. Vat2 yeast cells grow more slowly than wild type, they lack the entire vacuolar H+-ATPase complex, and their vacuolar lumenal pH is 7.1. The phenotypic consequences of this lack of vacuolar acidification are under analysis. mutants revealed that two of the mutants were Clathrin-coated membranes have been implicated as sites of protein somng and membrane vesiculation during inuacellular protein transport. To investigate the function of clathrin in these processes, we have generated viable, slow-growing mutants of the yeast Succhuromyces cerevisiae which lack clathrin heavy chain. Recent results have focused our attention on clathrin's role in orchestrating maturation of the peptide pheromone a-factor as it is secreted from cells. The biosynthetic pathway of a-factor follows the paradigm of peptide hormone maturation and secretion by eukaryotic cells: the hormone is synthesized as part of a larger precursor which is proteolytically processed during nansport through the secretory pathway. Proteolytic maturation of a-factor precursor occurs as the polypeptide passes through the Golgi body and is packaged into secretory vesicles. Characterization of a-factor production by chcZ and CHCZ strains revealed that mutants export a highly glycosylated form of the precursor that has not been proteolytically processed. The defect in a-factor processing can be accounted for by the finding that the protease which initiates maturation in the Golgi apparatus, the K M 2 endoprotease (Xex2p). is mislocalized to the cell surface in chcl cells. Based on this observation we suggest that, in wild-type cells, clathrin serves to retain Kex2p in the Golgi apparatus. In order to determine whether clathrin plays a role in the localization of other Golgi membrane proteins we are determining whether the inmcellular retention another a-factor maturation enzyme, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A, is also perturbed in chcl cells. Analysis of the subcellular distribution of both maturation enzymes is being carried out using cells canying a temperature-sensitive allele of chcl. In this fashion, the immediate effects of a loss of clathrin heavy chain function can be ascertained. Preliminary results suggest that, within an hour after shift to the non-permissive temperature, the mutant cells secrete a-factor precursor and mislocalize Kex2p to the cell surface. Finally, the secretion of a-factor precursor is being used as a genetic screen to isolate yeast mutants defective in clathrin assembly.",

The adenoviral glycoprotein, derived from the E3 region of the virus, is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected cells, where it retains newly synthesized class I molecules. We have examined the structural features of the viral protein, termed E19. to identify a motif responsible for its subcellular distribution. Truncations of the 15 amino acid long cytoplasmic tail promoted exit from the ER. The cytoplasmic tail sequence is not only necessary but sufficient for retention in the ER, as demonstrated by the fact that several plasma-membrane proteins become retained in the ER if the COOH-terminal sequence of El9 is appended. A series of chimeric constructs were engineered to examine the size of the structural motif, its position dependence and its sequence requirements. The six terminal residues were sufficient to induce retention but they have to occupy the extreme COOH-terminal position to be functional. Similar size COOH-terminal sequences from five endogenous, ER-retained transmembrane proteins could also induce retention of marker proteins if positioned in the COOH-terminal position. An extensive series of point mutations identified the common denominator for retention as two lysines in positions -3 and -4 or -3 and -5 .",

In order to understand the basis for selective retention of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we have investigated a panel of mutant vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins with structural alterations in the extracellular, transmembrane, or cytoplasmic domains. Analysis of the interaction of heavy chain binding protein (BiP, GRF'78) with the newly synthesized wild-type glycoprotein showed that BiP recognized only incompletely disufide bonded precursors of the glycoprotein and was released once the correct disulfide bonds had formed. Mutations in the extracellular domain which caused protein retention in the ER also caused glycoprotein aggregation, failure to acheive correct intrachain disulfide bonding, and formation of a stable complex with BiP. In contrast, a mutation in the transmembrane domain which leads to glycoprotein aggregation and retention, did not cause incorrect disulfide bond formation and BiP was not retained in the aggregate. A third group of mutations in the cytoplasmic domain resulted in slowed or blocked transport from the ER. These mutations did not detectably affect folding, correct disulfide bonding, or oligomerization of the extracellular domain, nor did they lead to stable complex formation with BiP. We conclude that BiP may be involved in retention of certain misfolded proteins, but that binding by BiP cannot explain retention or slow export of other mutant proteins.",

When a mutant with a cytoplasmic tail that causes retention in the ER (but which also form trimers) is expressed in the same cell as the wild-type protein, little or no mixing to form heterotrimers occurs. However, when export of both proteins from the ER is blocked, the wild-type and mutant proteins form heterotrimers efficiently. These results suggest that the wild-type protein is normally physically separated from the mutant protein during trimer formation. Models that might explain this finding will be discussed. The secretogranins (chromogranins) are a family of secretory proteins which are widespread constituents of the matrix of secretory granules in endocrine and neuronal cells. We use the secretogranins as model proteins to study the sorting of regulated secretory proteins and the biogenesis of secretory granules in neuroend-e cells. The secretogranins contain sorting information to secretory granules which is sufficient to divert a constitutive secretory protein. An immunocomplex consisting of newly synthesized secretogranin I and a monoclonal anti-secretogranin I antibody was efficiently packaged into secretory granules of PC12 cells. To identify this sorting information, we have determined and compared the sequences of chromogranin A, secretogranin I and secretogranin 11. Striking common features include a conserved ten-amino-acid motif, abundance of acidic residues, and an alternating helix-turn secondary structure. In line with the latter two properties, the secretogranins have been found to aggregate in the presence of calcium. The secretogranin aggregates include other regulated secretory proteins but exclude constitutive secretory proteins. The calciuminduced aggregation of secretogranins in vitro is much reduced at neutral pH, and the packaging of secretogranins into secretory granules in vivo is inhibited by ammonium chloride.

In contrast to nervous tissue, endocrine cell lines provide a tractable system for the study of synaptic vesicle biogenesis. Endocrine cell lines express the known synaptic vesicle proteins and package them into a vesicle that has a size, density and protein composition very similar to those of authentic brain synaptic vesicles. In the endocrine cell line, PC12, the synaptic vesicle-like structures are generated by endocytosis. as are authentic synaptic vesicles. Since the PC12 vesicles exclude known markers of receptor-mediated endocytosis we suggest that they arise by a novel endocytotic pathway. Chimeric proteins are being constructed to identify sorting domains. When a synaptic vesicle protein is expressed stably or transiently in non-neuronal cell lines, it is found in vesicles dissimilar to synaptic vesicles. We suggest that a synaptic vesicle protein is targeted to pre-existing endocytotic structures in non-neuronal cells, but in endocrine cells expressing all the synaptic vesicle proteins, a novel pathway arises that generates synaptic vesicle structures.

Sorting has been localized to the trans-Golgi network. Apical and basolateral components are segregated into separate carrier vesicles. Conditions have been established that lead to the formation of both apical and basolateral carrier vesicles from the trans-Golgi network and to their release from the cells (1) . The vesicles have well-defined sedimentation pmpemes and the orientation expected of transport vesicles and they have been isolated by immUnoisolation and characterized. The protein patterns of the apical and basolateral carrier vesicles isolated from virus-infected MDCK cells have k n compared by 2-D gel electrophoresis. The results show that the vesicles have proteins in common as well as proteins presumably specific for the apical and the basolateral routes. Studies are in progress to define whether the mechanisms for both apical and basolateral sorting in the trans-Golgi network are specific for epithelial cells or whether one of the pathways has a counterpart in non-polarized cells such as fibroblasts (2) . 1.

A variety of pieces of evidence have pointed to an increasing complexity of structure and function of the organellar system that precedes the Golgi in the secretory pathway. These involve the regulation of transport, degradation and the possibility of the retrieval of proteins into the ER. In studying the effects of the fungal anti-metabolite, Brefeldin A (BFA), we noted an intriguing phenotype that underlay the previously reported inhibition of secretion from the ER seen with this drug. Within minutes of the addition of BFA, the Golgi cisternae were no longer apparent in the cell and proteins contained within the &/medial and trans Golgi cisternae were now found in the endoplasmic reticulum.",

Within two minutes after the addition of BFA, the Golgi cisternae swelled and gave rise to long \"necklace-like\", tubulo-vesicular structures. These structures were associated with microtubules. Golgi proteins appeared transiently in these \"necklaces\" before redistributing into the ER. The formation of these necklaces could be inhibited by reducing temperatures to below 16OC. The \"necklace\" structures were not observed when cells were preincubated with drugs that depolymerize microtubules or that deplete cellular ATP. Although there is no detectable Golgi structure in the presence of BFA, examination of the distribution of a 53 kD component of intermediate vesicles (developed by Hans-Peter Hauri) situated between the ER and Golgi revealed that these vesicles remained distinct from the ER over long periods of time in the presence of BFA. When cells were treated with BFA to allow Golgi proteins to redistribute into the ER and then treated with microtubule disrupting agents, the Golgi proteins exited the ER and accumulated in large structures that co-localized with the 53 kD marker. lndiginous resident ER proteins did not leave the ER in the presence of BFA and nocodazole. These findings suggest that in the presence of BFA a constant cycling of membrane occurs between the ER and an intermediate compartment, and that the retrograde arm of this cycle is blocked by nocodazole. By lowering the temperature to 16OC in the absence of drugs, the 53 kD intermediate compartment marker accumulated in a Golgi-like structure and in necklace-like extensions that were indistinguishable from those first observed in the presence of BFA. These necklaces were abolished by dropping the temperature below 16OC or by treatment with nocodazole. In the absence of BFA, these necklaces only contained the 53 kD marker and no Golgi proteins. However, upon addition of BFA, the necklaces could now be co-stained with the 53 kD protein and Golgi markers. The implications of these findings for an ER recycling pathway will be discussed.",

            "text": "CLATHR In 1987 we reported on the development of a membrane preparation that supports the assembly of clathrin coated pits. (1). This membrane system has been used to demonstrate that purified coat proteins from bovine coated vesicles will assemble coated pits at a limited number of assembly sites following treatment to remove endogenous clathrin (2). Moreover, when these membranes with their endogenous coated pits are allowed to warm to 37'C, the flat lattices round up and a large percentage of the clathrin dissociates from the membrane (3). This dissociation is inhibited by treatment of the membranes with the ATP destroying enzyme, apyrase. All of these studies have been camed out on membranes that are derived from cells that have been allowed to attach and spread on the surface of a poly-L-lysine coated substratum at 37\u00b0C. An alternate method of membrane isolation has been developed in which the cells are attached to the coated coverslip by centrifugation at 4'C. The membranes prepared by this procedure contain several fold less clathrin than membranes from 37 * C spread cells; moreover, by rapid-freeze deep-etch microscopy the regions of clathrin-coated membrane that are present resemble much more closely the coated pits present on intact cells (i.e. their morphology ranges from flat to deeply invaginated). Although these coated pits will also become increasingly invaginated when warmed, the coated pits do not disassemble but seem to arrest at the pinching o f f stage. Studies in progress are designed to determine if pinching off is stimulated by the addition of specific cytoplasmic factors. Additionally, we are also comparing the two types of membranes for their ability to support coated pit assembly. Based on these observations, apparently not all coated pits are created equal. Following binding at the cell surface, ligands and receptors can follow several intracellular routes. We have used fluorescent transfenin to follow the receptor recycling pathway and fluorescent LDL or a 2-macroglobulin to follow the pathway to lysosomes. Using image intensification fluorescence microscopy and digital image analysis, we measured the fluorescence intensity of single endosomes in intact cells. We have been able to determine the kinetics of fusion and segregation of endosomes following endocytosis of fluorescent ligands. Vesicles containing newly endocytosed ligands and receptors are delivered to a fusion competent \"sorting endosome\". Each sorting endosome has a lifetime of approximately 8 minutes during which it exports recycling components while simultaneously fusing with new endosomes and accumulating ligands which are targeted to lysosomes. Thus, LDL accumulates approximately 40-fold during the lifetime of a sorting endosome, but transferrin accumulates only 3-4 fold. The endosomes containing LDL or a2-macroglobulin become incompetent for fusion with new endosomes with a half time of about 8 minutes. The kinetics of fusion accessibility and maturation to fusion inaccessibility have been confirmed by an independent fluorescence assay based on the mixing of sequentially formed endosomes containing fluorescein labeled ligands chased by anti-fluorescein IgG. The kinetics of vesicle fusion and budding documented in these studies suggest that high efficiency recycling of membrane components could operate as a default pathway as a result of many iterations of a moderately efficient sorting process. Mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) cany soluble lysosomal enzymes from the trans Golgi network (TGN) to late endosomes and then return to the TGN for another round of lysosomal enzyme transport. We have reconstituted the recycling of the 300kD MPR from late endosomes back to the TGN in a cell-free system' and are analyzing the cytosolic components required for this transport step. MPRs use clathrin-coated vesicles for export from the TGN and also during endocytosis. However, it is not yet known whether clathrin mediates MPR recycling back to the TGN. We utilized clathrin heavy chain antibody X19 (generously provided by Dr. F. Brodsky, UCSF) which inhibits endocytosis in vivo2 to test its effect on MPR transport to the TGN. Under conditions in which the in v i m endocytosis of transfenin (assayed according to Smythe er ~1 . 3 ) was inhibited -60%. X19 IgG had no effect on MPR recycling to the TGN. Thus MPR recycling does not appear to involve clathrin. In addition, the clathrin dependence of in vitro endocytosis documents the physiological significance of this reaction. We have also identified a novel, NEM-sensitive cytosolic factor (factor Y) required for MPR recycling, that is distinct from NSF, a protein required for ERjGolgi and intra-Golgi transport, as well as endocytic vesicle fusion. Factor Y is entirely cytosolic and is proteinaceous as shown by its sensitivity to hypsin or boiling; it has an apparent Mr of -150K by gel filtration and velocity sedimentation. Cytosol depleted of NSF activity fully restores MPR recycling in vim. In contrast to NSF, factor Y may only be involved in a limited number of uansport events, and its characterization will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying vesicular transport.",

            "text": "Unlike most receptors, 300kD MPRs are localized primarily in the TGN and in endosomes, and they cycle constitutively between these compartments. Yet, when present at the cell surface, MPRs can undergo conventional receptor-mediated endocytosis. We constructed a chimeric receptor, comprised of EGF receptor extracellular and transmembrane domains joined to the MPR cytoplasmic domain, to test whether the MPR cytoplasmic domain contained sufficient information to direct a cell surface receptor into both of these transport pathways. The expressed protein was stable, bound EGF with high affinity, and was efficiently endocytosed and recycled to the cell surface, ? EGF. If the cytoplasmic domain alone is responsible for sorting native MPRs, chimeric receptors might have been expected to be located primarily in the TGN and in endosomes at steady state. Surprisingly, while most endogenous MPRs were intracellular, >85% of the chimeric receptors were located at the cell surface. These experiments demonstrate that the MPR cytoplasmic domain is not sufficient to alter the distribution of the EGF receptor, and suggest a role for extracellular and aansmembrane domains in MPR routing. We have developed separate cell-free assay systems which measure two distinct early events in receptormediated endocytosis in order to begin their biochemical characterization. One assay measures coated pit formation and the selective packaging of membrane proteins and receptors into coated vesicles in virro. In it, we take advantage of a novel cell-& system involving 'semi-intact' cells: cells in which a portion of the plasma membrane has been remved so as to deplete them of cytoplasm but otherwise maintain their inhacellular organelles intact and accessible to exogenously added reagents. Ow approach is as follows: radiolabelled ligands (usually difemc transfenin) are bound to intact cell monolayers on ice, unbound ligand is removed and the cells are made semi-intact. The semi-intact cells are washed free of cytosol and reincubated at 37' C with or without added cytosol and an ATP regenerating system. Following incubation, internalization of prebound ligands into a sealed membrane-bound endocytic compartment is determined. We have developed a novel reagent for this purpose which involves biotinylation of a protein ligand such as hansferrin (Tfn) using the cleavable biotinylating reagent, NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce). Bi0tinylated-~25LTfn is determined by adsorption to avidin-Sepharose. Ligand internalization is assessed by acquisition of resistance to cleavage by the membrane impermeant sulfhydryl reagent, glutathione. Using this assay, we find that prebound Biotin-S-S-12fcI-Tfn (1251-BSST) is rapidly internalized into a glutathione-resistant sealed membrane compartment with kinetics comparable to those obsewed in intact cells. Acquisition of glutathione resistance is dependent on ATP, cytosol and incubation at elevated temperatures. We are currently using this assay to fractionate and identify the cytosollic requirements. A second assay measures the specific membrane fusion event between primary endocytic (coated) vesicles and 'early' endosomes. Membrane fusion is assessed in a manner similar to that described by W. A. Braell (1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 84:1137-1141), by measuring the mixing of vesicle contents between 'donor' coated vesicles containing avidin-HRP and an 'acceptor' fraction of early endosomes containing biotinylated-transfemn .",

The Golgi apparatus, as well as late endosomes and lysosomes, colocalizes in the perinuclear region around the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in interphase fibroblasts. This spatial apposition of key organelles involved in intracellular membrane traffic may facilitate intercompartmental transport and connect the secretory and endocytic pathways. Clustering of Golgi elements and endosomes around the MTOC depends on microtubules. Disruption of microtubules by nocodazole leads to random scattering of Golgi elements and endosomes throughout the cytoplasm, similar to dispersal of these organelles at the onset of mitosis. Removal of nocodazole and subsequent microtubule repolymerization leads to reclustering of these organelles around the MTOC within 30-60min.

SRP54 which has recently been cloned (Bernstein et al. 1989, Nature 340, 482-486; Romisch et al. 1989, ibid., 478-482) contains a putative GTP binding site and a Met-rich region at the carboxy-terminus. Based on secondary structure prediction the latter region has been suggested to form a binding pocket for signal peptides. In order to test this hypothesis we have crosslinked the signal peptide of preprolactin to SRP in vitro in a wheat germ translation system. Crosslinked SRP was released from the ribosomes, sucrose gradient purified and subsequently digested with elastase. Two major digestion products of about 32K and 27K were obtained. In order to localize these peptides within the primary structure of SRP54 we currently trying to immunoprecipitate them with a variety of antibodies against SRP54.

Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024. In eukaryotic cells, secretory proteins are synthesized on ribosomes attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After signal recognition particle (SRP) recognizes and directs the polysomes synthesizing secretory proteins to docking protein in the ER, the polysomes become attached to the ER membrane by a protein-mediated mechanism. The assay system that has been used to study ribosome binding Consists of initially stripping rough microsomes of their ribosomes with puromycin, nuclease. and high salt, and then adding labeled ribosomes to the stripped rough microsomes (RMsn) in low salt buffer. To begin to identify the proteins necessary for translocation after the SRP mediated step, controlled proteolysis was used to eliminate the ribosome binding to the ER. Gentle proteolysis with certain proteases eliminated only a small fraction of the ribosome binding activity but generated proteolytic fragments that inhibited the binding of ribosomes to RMsn that had not been proteolyzed. As visualized on silver-stained SDS-acrylamide gels, the initial active protease digest contained approximately 40 protein species. Column chromatography was used to separate this digest. In low sak and at neutral pHI the activity could be bound to both anionic resins (CM, SP, heparin agarose. and phosphocellulose) and cationic resins (QAE and DEAE). In addition, an affinity column was made by attaching salt-washed canine pancreatic riboWmeSto Affigel-10. At present, through the combination of various columns. the purest active fraction contains four fragments. Once the fragment with activity is determined, anti-fragment antibodies will then be used in order to identify the entire protein from which the fragment is derived, to try to inhibit ribosome binding as well as in vitro protein translocation. and to clone the cDNA encoding this protein for further structural and functional analysis.",

Christopher Nicchitta, Giovanni Migliaccio and 6Iinter Blobel, Laboratory of Cell Biology, Howard Hughes Institute, Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021. Salt and EDTA washed canine pancreas rough microsomes were solubilized with detergent, the mixture centrifuged to remove components sedimenting at S values greater than 50 s and vesicles reassembled by dialysis of the high speed supernatant. In in vitro translation/translocation assays the reconstituted vesicles processed preprolactin in a cotranslational, SRP dependent manner. Mature prolactin was inextractable with EDTA or high salt, sedimented with the membrane fraction and was protected from digestion with exogenous protease. These results indicate that the reconstituted vesicles were competent for the targeting and translocation of secretory precursors. The reconstituted vesicles were devoid of lumenal proteins including BiP and PDI, suggesting that these proteins are not absolutely required for translocation of secretory precursors. A number of rough ER localized glycoproteins have been implicated in the processes associated with nascent chain targeting and translocation. To attempt to determine the glycoprotein requirement f o r these events, we have initiated studies on vesicles assembled from detergent extracts depleted of glycoproteins by chromatography on Con-A Sepharose columns. The results of these studies will be presented. One of OUT main research interests is the identification of integral membrane proteins of the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum that are involved in protein translocation. We are currently using membrane-bound ribosomes to guide us to these proteins. We have developed an assay in which the water soluble, membrane impermeable, thiol-cleavable, crosslinker 3,Y-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidylpropionate)(DTSSP) was added to rough microsomal membranes under non-reducing conditions. The membrane was later solubilized with a nonionic detergent and layered over a sucrose cushion. The centrifugation conditions were such that the ribosomes and any crosslinked proteins would selectively pellet This pellet was then resuspended under reducing conditions to reverse the crosslinks. The ribosomes were then pelleted again, leaving any previously attached proteins in the supernatant. A specific group 01 proteins were reproducibly crosslinked to the ribosome with this crosslinking reagent One protein has been identified by Western blotting as the 35K subunit of the signal sequence receptor (SSR). Further analysis of these proteins has been done by blotting with concanavalin A, Western blotting with antibodies to the signal recognition particle receptor and antibodies to ribophorin I. We have also analyzed these proteins with these techniques after the crosslinked, solubilized proteins were separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. We propose that the proteins identified by this procedure are components or nearest neighbors of the translocation apparatus. It is generally accepted that mitochondrial precursor proteins must attain a loosely folded conformation prior to translocation across the mitochondria1 membranes. Cytosolic factors such as the HSP70 family of stress induced proteins have been implicated in the maintenance of this conformation. It has previously been shown that the F1-ATPase p subunit precursor contains redundant targeting information [MCB 7:4038 (1987) l. In order to determine the possible role of these redundant sequences in the maintenance of import competence prior to translocation, I have examined the ability of a series of mutant targeting signals of the F1-ATPase B subunit precursor to assist in the maintenance of an import competent conformation. Results from both in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that the redundant aspect of the import signal is directly involved in maintaining the import competence of this precursor. Cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) is a hemeprotein located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria i he yeast Sncchuromyces cerevisiae. Recent results from our lab show that the in electrochemical potential across the inner mem8rane for processing an compartmentalization, the signal protease maturation step is not chelator sensitive, and the precursor is not processed by a matrix-localized rotease. Our mterpretation of these results is that preCCP-pr0~75 import is different apparent{ from the pathwa described for Rieske Fe/S protein, cytochrome c1 and cytochrome bZ. We have constructegignal sequence deletion mutants which have various degrees of the 3' end of the signal sequence deleted. These mutant proteins test whether preCCP-pro175 possesses a matrix targetting domain which functions in the absence of its IMS sorting doman. These signal sequence mutants are targeted to the mitochondrial matrix and are sensitive to the ionophore, valinomycin, indicating a requirement for a chemical potential across the inner membrane. The signal mutants are also not processed by the matrix localized protease suggesting that this protein does not require matrix interactions for wild type localization.

Trumpower and Mark Schmitt, Department of Biochemistry, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH Subunit 6 of the mitochondrial cytochrome bcl complex is unusual in that it contains an acidic presequence. A yeast mutant (MES5) in which QCR6, the nuclear gene encoding subunit 6, was disrupted with the URA3 gene is petite and lacks the entire cytochrome containing portion of the respiratory chain and the associated cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase activities. The URA3 disruption of QCR6 is capable of replacing the acidic presequence of subunit 6 with a positively charged, generic mitochondrial targeting presequence. The MES5 petite strain reverts, is complemented by a plasmid encoded copy of QCR6. and gives rise to a respiratory competent diploid when mated against a rho\" strain. Mitochondrial protein synthesis and oiigomycin sensitive ATPase activities are unaffected in MES5. We conclude that MESS is not due to a mutation in the mitochondrial genome (rho-), and is not due to a global impairment of mitochondrial protein import. We postulate that the cytochrome bcl and cytochrome c oxidase complexes are assembled through a common nucleation event, and dissociate to form partially or completely assembled complexes at some point after subunit 6 of the bc1 complex h a s been added. According to this model an aberrant copy of subunit 6 interrupts assembly of the two respiratory complexes at a stage where they are part of a common precursor complex. Cpchrome c peroxidase is a 33000-da heme protein located in the intermembrane space (IMS) o Saccharomyces cerevkiue mitochondria. This nuclearly encoded gene product is s thesized as a precursor (preCCP) containin 68 amino terminal residues that resumably direct t c protein to the mitochondria and sort it to tfe IMS. We have recently shown tlat a large percentage of the precursor is processed rior to its complete translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane (Kaput et aZ[188CJ] J.

Althou h several control experiments demonstrated that there was no soluble activity on the outside ofgthe mitochondria and that the outer membrane was intact, preCCP might be processed by some protease contaminant in the mitochondrial preparation or the reticulocyte lysate. To test this possibility, mitochondria isolated from aPEP4 strain were used in an in v i m im ort assa in the presence and absence of epstatin A, leupeptin, PMSF, antipain, chymostatin, &K, TPk, TrasyloP, and EDTA. PreCEP was processed by PEP4 mitochondria in the presence of these protease inhibitors yet the majority of the processed form was not associated with the mitochondria ellet These results support our previous conclusion that the processing and release of preCCi occurs on the normal import pathway. We have also determined that processing of preCCP to its mature-sized form occurs by a protease which requires an intact inner membrane for its activity.",

San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, We have previously characterized a temperature-sensitive (ts) yeast mutant that displays defects in both mitochondrial protein import and progress through the cell cycle. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the growth, import and cell cycle defects in mad cells are due to a single, recessive, nuclear mutation. We have isolated a 12.6kb genomic clone which complements the ts, import and cell cycle phenotypes and maps to the mas3 locus. Sequence analysis of a 5.8kb subclone which complements the ts mutation revealed two open reading frames (ORFs) which share 190bp of overlapping sequence corresponding to regions encoding the amino-termini of both potential proteins. ORFl encodes a protein with a putative mitochondrial targeting signal and several membrane spanning regions, while ORF2 does not appear to contain characteristic targeting or membrane spanning regions. A replacement of the l.lkb region containing the overlap and additional sequences with the URA3 gene in a diploid created a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that at least one of the open reading frames encodes an essential gene. We are currently constructing various deletion and insertion mutations in order to delineate the role(s) of the ORF(s) in protein import and the cell cycle. The assembly of mitochondrially and cytoplasmically translated subunits of the first enzyme in the electron transport chain of the inner rnitochondrial membrane, NADH dehydrogenase, was studied in rat hepatoma cultures. The rate of appearance of component proteins was measured by incorporation of pulse-labeled proteins into immunoprecipitable enzyme. Nuclear coded, imported polypeptides appear immediately after a [35S]methionine pulse and retain constant stoichiometry. Mitochondrially coded proteins, although rapidly translated, peak at different times between 0 and 12 h of chase in the immunoprecipitated enzyme. Synthesis and import of nuclear coded proteins is necessary for mitochondrially coded proteins to be assembled, although the reverse is not true. Excess, unassembled rnitochondrially translated subunits are degraded in an oligomycin sensitive manner. These data are consistent with a model in which a scaffold of imported proteins forms the inner core of the enzyme and mitochondrially translated proteins attach to the scaffold in a time dependent manner, acting to anchor NADH dehydrogenase into the inner membrane. It appears that an ordered, sequential assembly process may be common to inner rnitochondrial membrane enzymes comprised of both nuclearly and mitochondrially translated proteins. ORE. Theoretical analyses of mitochondrial matrix transit peptides indicate that positive charges and hydrophobic residues are critical for function. Chloroplast transit peptides are less basic, but also contain many betahydroxy amino acids. A synthetic peptide comprising the first 24 residues of wheat ss RUBISCO and a peptide comprising the 24-residue transit sequence of rat malate dehydrogenase adopt helical structures in detergents, trifluoroethanol and acidic phospholipids. The MDH peptide increases respiration in coupled mitochondria, and causes release of the dye calcein from PC liposomes in a way that is antogonised by cadmium and zinc. Structural predictions indicate it may form a membrane-active amphiphilic helix. Proline residues in the chlorplast peptide may distort any helix that is formed. Photoreactive derivatives of these peptides cross-link to 30kDa proteins in inner membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts. we have found that the GroEL-RuBisCO subunit complex dissociates in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATP-y-S, as well as ATP. with the fusion protein in minor amounts and also dissociates in the presence of ATP, but less well in the presence of ATP-7-S.

Experiments with selective inhibitors as well as time course analyses employing a rapid stopping technique reveal an assembly pathway that includes: a. transport across the double envelope membrane and immediate processing to mature size (25 Da); b. assembly into a soluble 90 kDa complex in the organelle matrix (the stroma); and c. insertion into the thylakoid membrane. Assembly into the 90 kDa complex as well as insertion into thylakoids can be reconstituted with chloroplast subfractions. Complex formation requires a high molecular weight stromal component, is stimulated by Mg ions, but doesn't require ATP. Thylakoid insertion requires thylakoids, energy in the form of ATP and pmf, and a stromal protein. When stroma is fractionated by gel filtration, insertion activity coelutes with 90 kDA complex forming activity. However, these activities are not identical. Isolation of the 90 kDa complex demonstrates that although complex formation maintains LHCP in an insertionally competent form, insertion into the membrane still requires stroma, indicating an additional stroma-mediated reaction. These and other observations suggest a multistep, soluble intermediate assembly pathway that involves 3 different reactions in the stroma.

The B chain has two roles in delivering the A chain into the target cell cytoplasm: it binds to cell surface galactosides and it facilitates the membrane translocation of A chain from the trans Golgi cisternae into the cytoplasm. Recently it has been proposed that the B chain translocation activity requires intracellular galactose binding, although this conclusion is controversial at present. To explore this possibility further, we have used the cloned rich B chain gene, oligonucleotide sitedirected mutagenesis and expression in a heterologous euka otic system to produce soluble, mutant ricin B chain no longer able to bind galactose. The sility of this mutein to facilitate translocation of ricin A chain has been assessed.

Ten mutants defective in peroxisome assembly (pas mutants) will be described. They fall into at least six complementation groups. A s a first step to dissect the mechanism of peroxisome biogenesis the PAS1 gene has been cloned by functional complementation of a pas1 mutant. The gene contains an open reading frame encoding 1043 amino acids. The predicted protein shares a region of about 150 amino aclds of a remarkable degree of similarity ( 7 50%) with regions of the two fusion proteins Secl8p and NSF. This region which is conserved in all three proteins may represent a functional domain necessary for a fundamental step in protein sorting. By means of antibodies raised against a Pasl-O-galactosidase fusion protein the Paslp has been identified. A preliminary characterization will be reported. Translocation of alcohol oxidase OCCUIS using the holoenzyme or enzyme which has been thermally denatured. Control injections of non-peroxisomal proteins show no such punctate staining. This assay should be useful for addressing many questions regarding peroxisomal protein import, such as whether protein unfolding or membrane gmdients are involved.

We have previously identified the minimal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS) in luciferase as the C-terminal three amino acids of the protein, serine-lysine-leucine. We have also demonstrated that luciferase is transported to peroxisomes in mammalian, insect, plant and yeast cells. We now show that the same signal used for import into mammalian peroxisomes is used for import into yeast peroxisomes. In addition, we have raised antibodies that specifically react with the peroxisomal targeting signal. These antibodies can be used to detect peroxisomes in yeast, Neurospora, Trypanosome, plant, frog, and mammal ian cells by electron microscopy and peroxisomal proteins from these organisms in Western blots. Together, these data demonstrate that the tripeptide PTS identified in luciferase can function in diverse species and that endogenous peroxisomal proteins from these organisms often contain this form of PTS.",

Haren, The Netherlands. The methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha induces large peroxisomes when grown on methanol as a carbon source. Peroxisomal proteins like methanol oxidase and dihydroxyacetone synthase (DAS) do not contain a carboxy-terminal SKL sequence that was shown to serve as a target signal in other eukaryotic cells (Gould et al. (1989) J.Cell Biol. 100: 1657). However, a stretch of 12 amino acids containing SKL could be used for efficient transport of the bacterial p-lactamase (BLA) into the peroxisomes of H. polymorpha as verified by isolated peroxisomes and immuno-cytochemical staining of thin sections. Deletion of the carboxy terminus (37 amino acids) of DAS abolished import of the protein. Fusion of this amino acid stretch to BLA mediates transport of the heterologous protein into peroxisomes. Fusion of the N-terminus of DAS (115 amino acids) to BLA did not result in protein import. Therefore, the DAS protein obviously contains a carboxy-terminal target signal that will be further characterized.",

Human ribophorin I, a RER specific protein when expressed in S. cerevisiae, is targeted to and concentrated within translocation-competent membranes. Using this marker together with two other putative yeast ER proteins, BiP and SEC 62, we have isolated rough and smooth membranes which are physically and functionally distinct. In order to identify proteins involved in translocation we have further purified yeast RER derived membranes. As in mammalian cells, chemical removal of ribosomes results in a unique density perturbation that specifically shifts RER derived membranes away from contaminating membranes of similar buoyant density. Membranes isolated by this method are translocation competent and contain a set of unique proteins that may well play a role in translocation. Genes that function in translocation of secretory protein precursors into the ER have been identified by a genetic selection for mutant yeast cells that fail to translocate a signal peptide-cytosolic enzyme hybrid protein. The mutant, sec63, is thermosensitive for growth and accumulates a variety of secret0 and vacuolar precursors that lack post-translational modifications indicative of insertion into the ER. yome form of interaction among the SEC61, SEC62 and SEC63 gene roducts is suggested by the observation that haploid cells containing any air of the mutations are inviabk at 24\u00b0C and show a marked enhancement of the translocation defect. 'he translocation defect of the sec63 mutant has been reproduced in vitro. qcrosomes from sec63 cells display low and thermolabile translocation activity for prepro-a-factor synthesized with a cytosol fraction from wild-type yeast. Cloning and DNA sequencing of SEC63 (Sadler er al. 1989 . J. Cell Biol. 109, in press) has revealed a 76 ammo acid domain that is homologous to a region of E. coli Dnal grotein, a heat shock protein that works in concert with the 70kD heat shock protein, DnaK, to catalyze acteriophage lambda re lication. We have constructed a collection of Sec63pinvertase ene fusions to examine the topology of &63 in the ER membrane. Preliminaxanalysis indicates that the%nal homology region faces the lumen of the #R. Sec63p may interact with the AR2 gene product, an ER lumenal protein homologous to the mammalian 70kD heat shock rotein B e , that a pears to be requued also for translocahon of proteins into the yeast ER (Rose et al. 1989 . c%!l57: 1211-1221f: The yeasty. lipolytica has two functional genes (SCRI and SCR2) which code for the putative SRP 7SL RNAs. At least one functional 7SL RNA is required for growth. In order to confirm that SCRl codes for a component of SRP and to provide in nivo evidence that SRP has a role in protein secretion, conditional lethal mutations in SCRl will be isolated and their effects on processing and secretion of alkaline extracellular protease will be examined. Two SCRl genes with mutations in a highly conserved stem loop region (Campos et al., NARS, 17,1573 which most likely interacts with the 19 K polypeptide of SRP have been constructed by sitedirected in viho mutagenesis. The mutations (SCRI-I, G s A at position 129 and A->T at position 131 and SCRI-2, deletion of nucleotides 126->135) will be introduced on a plasmid containing a LEU2 selectable marker into a strain containing chromosomal deletions of SCRl and SCR2 and wild type SCRl on a plasmid with a URA3 selectable marker. Leu+ Urastrains which contain only the mutated SCRl gene will be selected using 5fluoroorotic acid and screened for heat and cold sensitivity and possibly for hypersensitivity to D S . Random hydroxylamine in nitro mutagenesis and the plasmid shuffle will also be used to examine a broader range of mutations. Uracil permease, encoded by FUR4 gene, is a multispanning protein of the yeast plasma membrane. It has a long N-terminal hydrophilic segment, followed by 10 to 12 putative transmembrane seqments,and an hydrophilic C-terminus. The overexpression of active uracil permease allowed us to detect the protein in cell free extracts, with the use of an antibody raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequence. The protein does not seem to undergo important post-translational modifications, such as proteolytic processing or glycosylation, as judged by the absence of any matured forms in a pulse chase experiment, or by the absence of modification after endoglucosidase H treatment. By fusing increasing N-terminal segments of the uracil permease with signal peptide deleted acid phosphatase, we showed that the first putative transmembrane segment of the uracil permease indeed corresponds to the first signal anchor sequence. Several experimental arguments among which the absence of glycosylation of the three potential sites localized in the N-terminus of the permease allowed us to propose a cytosolic orientation of this N-terminal segment. The effect of sec61 and sec62 mutations on the translocation of uracil permease, or hybrid permease-phosphatase proteins,will be presented. We already know that sec62 mutation completely prevents membrane insertion of the hybrid protein carrying the first permease transmembrane segment. PHO5-IacZ hybrid proteins are composed of amino-terminal residues derived from the yeast repressible acid phosphatase (m) and bacterial @-galactosidase (kZ). When expressed in yeast, these PHO5-IacZ fusions cause the accurmlation of secretory pathway precursors on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. We have developed a genetic screen to identify mutations which suppress this phenotype. Yeast strains which carry an && lesion a c c d a t e a red pigment derived from the purine biosynthetic pathway. Transformants of an && strain which carry a pH05: :lac2 gene are red when grown W r conditions which repress expression of the fusion protein (high phosphate medium); but remain white when grown under inducing conditions (low phosphate medium). This change in colony color is dependent on the expression of the PHI5-LecZ fusion protein and has been used to enrich for suppressors of the hybrid-dependent block in secretion.",

After pulse-labeling, both glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of H2VW were recovered in microsomes but the latter was sensitive to digestion with uypsin. Thus, the nascent protein associated with the membrane but most of it was translocated into the ER post-translationally. Since the single glycosylation site in VP7 lies only eighteen residues beyond the signal peptide cleavage site, a rate-limiting step must occur very early in translocation of this protein. Bovine rotavirus VP7 which is also retained in the ER was glycosylated and translocated rapidly. Thus, the delay in translocation seen with the simian VW is not essential for retention of the protein in the ER. By constructing hybrids between the simian and bovine VP7",

We propose that despite rapid cleavage of the signal peptide, these sequences interact to modulate the translocation of the protein. Canine microsomal signal peptidase activity was previously found to purify as a complex of five proteins with molecular masses of 25,22/23,21, 18 and 12 kDa. Two of the signal peptidase complex (SPC) proteins have been cloned and sequenced. The differentially glycosylated subunit (22/23 kDa) was found to have no sequence similarity to other known proteins. However, the 21 kDa protein was observed to be a mammalian homolog of SECl1, a protein essential for signal peptide processing and cell growth in yeast. We have now cloned and sequenced the 18 kDa subunit of the SPC and find that it is also a SECll homolog. Both the 18 and 21 kDa SECl1 homologs are integral membrane proteins by virtue of their resistance to alkali extraction. Upon detergent solubilization of salt and EDTA exuacted rough microsomes (RMs), both proteins remain quantitatively complexed with the 22/23 kDa glycoprotein subunit. However, carbonate extraction of RMs prior to solubilization, or mild urea treatment, causes partial dissociation of the the SPC. The SECl 1-lie proteins displaced from the complex under these conditions demonstrate no signal peptide processing activity. The existence of homologous subunits is common to a number of known protein complexes and provides further evidence that the association between SPC proteins observed in vitro may be physiologically relevant to the mechanism of signal peptide processing and perhaps protein translocation. The 20 amino acid signal peptide of pre(Apro)apo-All contains the tripartite domain structure typical of eukaryotic prepeptides as well as multiple potential sites for co-translational processing. We previously analyed 40 mutant derivatives of this model preprotein by using an W o rranslation/canine microsome processing assay and radiochemical sequencing of the processed products. We showed that the site of cleavage chosen by signal peptidase is influenced by (i) the physical-chemical properties of the -1 residue (small, neutral amino acids are favored) and (ii) the distance distance between the ptential -1 residue and the h/c boundary (4-5 residues appear optimal). To investigate whether structural features in the NH2-terminal region of signal peptides play a role in cleavage specificity, we have carried out mutagenesis of a pre(Apro)apo-AII mutant. which has roughly equal cleavage between the GIy% and GlyZ0& sites. By inserting various amino acids between the (+) charged n-region (NH2-Met-Lys) and the h-region (hydrophobic core) we found that movement of the n/h boundary toward the NH2-terminus results in dramatic shift in cleavage to the upstream site. A significant but less dramatic shift was also observed when the NH2-Met-Lys dipeptide was moved upstream, while holding the position of the n/h boundary constant, relative to the original sites of cleavage.",

Because of their lack of sequence homology, signal peptides are thought to mediate transport on the basis of comparatively general structural and physical properties such as charge, hydrophobicity. and conformation rather than strict sequence specificity. However, one portion of the signal peptide, the cleavage region, seems to require a higher degree of amino acid sequence stringency than the rest of the signal peptide. In particular, this segment is enriched for polar residues and the amino acids found at positions -1 and -3 preceding the cleavage site are limited to small neutral side chains. In addition to these specific sequence requirements, secondary structural characteristics have also been implicated in the function of this region. Conformational predictive schemes and mutational studies have implicated the importance of a f3-turn for signal peptidase recognition and cleavage; several models of prokaryotic protein transport invoke at least the transient formation of a turn or loop structure during signal peptide insertion and/or cleavage. In this study. we have utilized evidence from physical studies in tandem with predictive schemes in an attempt IO vary systematically the physical and slructural parameters likely to contribute to the function of the cleavage region. Specifically. we have assessed the importance of hydrophobicity, presence or absence of a proline residue. and expected conformational preference. Using cassette mutagenesis, we have constructed polymeric, idealized sequences of varying hydrophobicities along with sequences corresponding IO known secondary smctures determined by physical data all within the framework of either a wild type or idealized signal peptide. Based on this analysis, we have found that that either a potential alpha helical or beta tum structure in the cleavage region can function equally well, irrespective of the presence of a proline residue.

When cDNA encoding pIg-R is expressed in polarized MDCK cell monolayers the receptor binds and transcytoses IgA as in vivo. We have previously shown that the 103 amino acid C-terminal cytolpasmic domain of pIg-R (residues 653-755) is required for correct receptor targeting to the basolateral cell surface as well as for endocytosis. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have attempted to further localize specific subdomains of the cytoplasmic tail that may mediate these functions. Truncation of the protein at Arg 669 yields a receptor with a 16 amino acid cytoplasmic domain (residues 653-669). This truncated receptor is delivered to the basolateral cell surface, as assayed by protease sensitivity and domain-selective biotinylation, but is not endocytosed. Conversely, an in-frame deletion of residues 655-668, leaving the remainder of the tail intact, yields a receptor that is delivered directly apically rather than basolaterally, and is capable of endocytosis, although at a reduced rate. We conclude that this short segment (655-668) contains a signal that is both necessary and sufficient for basolateral targeting of pIg-R in MDCK cells, and that is topologically distinct from the region involved in receptor endocytosis.",

To identify putative intracellular sorting domains in peptide hormone precursors, we have been investigating the heterologous expression of two of the simplest prohormones, namely pancreatic islet rosomatostatins (proSRIF) I and I1 (Stoller and Shields J.C. B. 107, 2087, 1988; J.C.B. 4, 1647, 19895 : When introduced into rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells, which do not proteolytically process the endogenously expressed growth hormone and prolactin, proSRIF-I is accurately processed to the mature hormone and efficiently targetted to the regulated secretory pathway. In contrast, when proSRIF-I1 (which shares 50% homology to proSRIF-1) is expressed in GH3 cells, it is neither proteolytically processed or secreted. Instead, it is quantitatively degraded intracellularly in a chloroquine/NH C I sensitive compartment, most probably, in lysosomes. Since the major differences between pro SRYF-I-and I1 reside in their NHZ-termimI propeptides, our data suggest that the propeptides possess sorting sequences which enable these precursors to be targeted to different organelles. To identify targetting domains, we constructed chimeric molecules comprising a series of truncated and mutated proSRIF-I molecules fused to a-globin. When native proSRIF-1 was fused t o a-globin, this chimera was cleaved to generate mature a-globin, of which approximately 25%-35% is targetted to the regulated pathway and secreted. In contrast, the control signal peptide-a-globin fusion is translocated into the E.R. and rapidly degraded (t 1/2 5 min) during transport to the Colgi apparatus. Our results suggest that the propeptides of hormone precursors contain structural information necessary for sorting to the regulated pathway.

CSPG precursors are locaked primarily in the perinuclear Golgi. while type II procollagen is present in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, CSPG precursors arc observed within a unique cytoplasmic compamnent distinct from the perinuclear Golgi. Simultaneous double immunotlulocalization studies demonsaate that this inhacellular compamnent contains CSFG precursors not yet modifted by Golgi-mediated processes. Link protein, a separate gene product which functions to stabilize exhacellular aggregates of CSFG monomer and hyaluronic acid, is colocalized in thii compartment. but type II procollagen is excluded. lmmunoelectron microscopic analysis utilizing immunoperoxidae reactions in a preembedment protocol reveals that these CSPG precursors are contained in smooth membranebounded regions of the ER continuous with the ribosome-studded ER lumen. Thus, CSPG precursors are segregated within the ER of chondrocyies. The presence of link protein and CSPG monomer precursors and the absence of type Il procollagen in these subcompattments of the ER would suggest that the regions play a role in the normal synthesis and procwing of cartilage proteoglycans.

We have characterized the protein by use of an antibody made Mature aleurain is 32 kDa in size and has one endo H-sensitive high mannose and one complex oligosaccharide side chains as shown by labelling in the presence of tunicamycin. Although aleurone cells are well characterized by their ability to secrete large amounts of hydrolases, aleurain is not secreted. Immunocytochemistry shows that aleurain is located in small vesicular structures that band in 40% sucrose. Pulse chase experiments show that a 42 kDa proform of aleurain is rapidly chased to a 33 kDa form which is then processed to the mature 32 kDa form. Inclusion of tunicamycin in pulse-chase experiments showed that unglycosylated forms of proaleurain are proteolytically processed in a manner similar to native proaleurain. This indicates that oligosaccharides are not required for either processing and/or correct targeting to the site of processing. In pulse chase experiments, the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 prevented the maturation of the 33 kDa to 32 kDa form, but did not interfere with the 42 kDa to 33 kDa conversion. Using as substrate, proaleurain, made by injection of in vitro synthesized aleurain mRNA into Xenopus oocytes, we have identified an activityin cruse extracts of aleurone cells that cleaves this to a 33 kDa form.

The DNA sequence revealed that it codes for a preproenzyme precursor which presents a putative signal sequence, a stretch of ten X-Ala or X-Pro dipeptides substrates for a dipeptidyl amino peptidase, a proregion presenting a glycosylation site and two Lys-Arg sites possible substrate for a like enzyme and the mature protein. Pulse-chase and innnuno-precipitation experiments have confirmed this processing (Ogridziak et col.). In order to determine the role of the proregion we have generated deletions in the proregion, mutated the glycosylation site and inserted linker in the region coding for the mature protease. The results presented indicate that any deletion in the proregion results in intracellular accumulation of the precursor or a toxic effect. Mutation of the glycosylation site or addition of a linker results in temperature dependent secretion and production of active AEP. From these results, we propose that the AEP proregion has a zymogene function and plays an essential role in guiding the proper folding of the protein to allow a conformation which is compatible for secretion.",

In this context, we have investigated the association of Chromogranin B (CgB), a secretory granule protein of most neuroendocrine cells with secretory granule membranes in PC 12 cells. When these cells are stimulated by 50 mM potassium, the secretory granules fuse with the plasma membrane resulting in the release of CgB into the extracellular medium. Using various experimental approaches including immunofluorescence microscopy and cell surface labelling, we show that a small part of the total cellular CgB is tightly associated with the secretory granule membrane and upon stimulation of secretion remains associated with the plasma membrane. Upon subsequent incubation of cells at 37 'C, this cell surface-associated CgB is rapidly intemalised. This membraneassociated CgB cannot be exhacted with p H 11 treatment but partitions into the aqueous phase upon Triton X-114 phase condensation. It is barely detected on the surface of unstimulated cells or on cells that were incubated with 10 mM ammonium chloride (which is known to cause missorting of CgB to the constitutive pathway of secretion). Moreover, when CgB is added t o unstimulated cells, it does not become tightly associated w i t h the plasma membrane. Taken together, these observations suggest that the surface-bound CgB reflects the existence of a subpopulation of CgB molecules that are tightly associated with the secretory granule membrane and, after exocytosis, become exposed at the plasma membrane. The biologicai significance of this membrane-associated CgB is currently under investigation. have both the constitutive and the regulated pathways of secretion. One morphological hallmark of cells which have the regulated pathway are large dense-core secretory granules. Secretory granules, which contain hormones and other biologically active substances in a concentrated aggregate, form from the Golgi network (TGN). The formation of secretory granules has been documented extensively using morphological techniques, however, the molecular mechanisms involved are still largely unknown. To obtain information on the formation of secretory granules we have studied the transport, out of the TGN, of secretogranin I and secretogranin 11, two proteins targetted to the regulated pathway, using a combination of sulfate labelling, which labels proteins immediately prior to their exit from the TGN, and subcellular fractionation based on velocity-controlled cenmfugation. Using these techniques we have identified the first vesicular intermediate. in the biogenesis of large dense-core secretory granules, the immature secretory granule. Immature Secretory granules were formed rapidly (tin= 5 min) from the TGN, and did not contain a constitutively secreted sulfate-labelled proteoglycan. The identification of the first intermediate in the formation of secretory granules has enabled us to develop a cell-free system to dissect the formation process. The cell-free. system uses both sulfate labelling and separation of the starting material (TGN) from the product (immature secretory granules) to monitor the formation of immature granules. With this cell-free system we have found that (i) regulated and constitutive proteins are sorted prior to their budding from the TGN in immature secretory granules and constitutive vesicles, respectively, (ii) the budding of both types of post-TGN organelles is inhibited by the addition of GTPyS. We are now investigating the cytosolic and membrane associated factors which may be involved in the cell-free formation immature secretory granules.",

These results suggest that phosphate donors other than ATP are utilized to reversibly modify proteins in response to stimuli and, in particular, that a cytosolic phosphoglycoprotein may be important in the regulation of secretion. The functional compartmentalization of neurons poses interesting questions concerning mechanisms of protein sorting and organelle biogenesis. Distal axons lack protein synthesizing machinery, but it is not clear whether organelles such as synaptic vesicles are fully formed in the cell body or if they are assembled from component elements in the periphery. We have begun to address these questions by studying the distribution and regulation of synaptophysin and p65, two integral membrane proteins found in small, clear vesicles of neurons and neuroendocrine cells. In PC12 cells, some of the fluorescent staining for synaptophysin appears to be coincident with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) binding sites in double labeling experiments. By contrast, p65 staining appears to be diffusely distributed and does not colocalize with WGA. In addition, western blot analysis indicates that stimulation of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor increases the level of p65 while decreasing the level of synaptophysin. These results suggest that the synthesis of these two proteins may be differently regulated: furthermore, the immunocytochemical evidence suggests that they may not be co-localized during early stages of vesicle biogenesis.

A CHANNEL PROTEIN OF THE SYNAPTIC VESICLE MEMBRANE, Knaus, P., Center for Molecular Biology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 282, D-6900 Heidelberg, FRG Regulated release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic nerve terminals is a process central to brain function. The most widely accepted model of triggered quanta1 release implies the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. Specific proteins of vesicles as well as the plasma membrane are likely to be involved in mediating and regulating exocytosis. Synaptophysin is an integral membrane protein of presynaptic vesicles. It shares not only the transmembrane topology with gap junction channel proteins, but also its quaternary structure. Synaptophysin is a homohexameric protein with a diameter of approxiamately 7.8 nm. An extended cytoplasmic domain of the protein is capable of binding calcium ions. Purified synaptophysin, when reconstituted to planar lipid bilayers, produces a large voltage-sensitive channel with multiple conductance levels (unit conductance 150pS in physiological salt solutions). Synaptophysin may be involved in regulating the storage contents of vesicles or may participate in the formation of a pore between the vesicle membrane and the presynaptic terminal to initiate neurotransmitter release. found that only a fraction of de novo synthesized apo B is secreted, the remainder is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is degraded. To understand the basis for these observations, we examined the first step in the secretory pathway: translocation. Translocation of apo B was determined by its sensitivity to degradation by the exogenous protease: trypsin. Trypsin reduced the amount of apo B in rough microsomes, whereas it had little (if any) effect on degradation of apo B in Golgi fractions. Essentially all of the apo B that was degraded was membrane bound. Monoclonal IgGs, against either the N-terminal or C-terminal halves of apo B, were bound to magnetic beads and used to immuno-isolate microsomes. In contrast, to the specific ability of the IgC's against apo B to isolate microsomes, little or no microsomes were isolated using non-immune IgG and IgG against albumin. Since microsomes remained intact and oriented right side out as demonstrated by the inability of trypsin to both degrade albumin and to affect the capacity of the intraluminal enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase to dephosphorylate mannosed-phosphate. the data suggest that a pool of apo B is exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. To determine if the trypsin accessible pool of apo B is a transient form, pulse/chase experiments were performed. The results show that the % of apo B (hat was trypsin accessible increased during the first 20 minutes of the chase, suggesting that during this time, the trypsin accessible pool of apo B is not translocated (it does not become trypsin insensitive). The combined data support the concept that apo B translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum determines its entry into two functionally distinct pools: the intraluminal trypsin insensitive pools in the assembly of VLDL; the trypsin accessible, non-translocated pool is shunted into the degradativc pathway.",

In the majority of HDL deficiency cases, the structure of the apo-A1 gene is normal and the causative mutation remains unknown. We discovered a mutation in chickens associated with a ten-fold deficiency in plasma apo-Al. The mutation is sex-linked; the phenotype segregates with markers on the z chromosome. By following the inheritance of an apo-A1 RFLP (in an irrelevant chicken strain) we showed that the apo-A1 gene is autosomal, hence the mutation responsible for the HDL deficiency is not in the apo-A1 gene. The levels of apo-A1 mRNA in the mutant animals are not reduced. The translational competence of the apo-A1 mRNA was demonstrated in a reticulocyte lysate system. Nevertheless, the amount of apo-A1 protein mass in liver from the animals is greatly reduced. It therefore appears that the mutants have a defect in a factor regulating an event occuring after transcription and RNA processing.

The COOH-terminal four amino acids of several peripheral membrane proteins of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are important in their retention within the ER lumen. In the heart and skeletal muscle, a number of peripheral SR membrane proteins have recently been identified. Calreticulin is a 55-kDa Caz+ binding protein, contained within skeletal and heart muscle SR and non-muscle ER. We isolated a cDN4 clone encoding for calreticulin from a neonatal rabbit skeletal muscle ngt11 library. The deduced COOH-terminal amino acid sequence was KDELidentical to the retention signal of the ER proteins. The signal probably encodes for retention of this protein within the SR lumen. A 55-kDa thyroid hormone binding protein, which is probably identical to the protein disulfide isomerase, 6-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and glycosylation site binding protein of oligosaccharyl transferase, is also present within muscle SR. Analysis of a cDNA clone from slow-twitch rabbit skeletal muscle encoding this protein showed that it contained a similar but not identical COOH-terminal sequence of RDEL. This suggests that the positively charged amino acids K and R can interchange and the retention signal is still active. In contrast to these results calsequestrin and a 53-kDa glycoprotein, two other peripheral membrane proteins residing in the lumen of the SR, do not contain the KDEL retention signal. The SR may have developed a unique retention mechanism(s) for these muscle specific proteins. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a nonlysosomal pathway for the degradation of newly synthesized proteins retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pathway is extremely selective, in that whereas some proteins are rapidly degraded, others survive for long periods in the ER. The question of whether this selectivity is due to the presence of peptide sequences or structural motifs within the sensitive proteins that target them for degradation has been addressed. We initially searched for such sequences by dissecting domains of the alpha chain of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR-a), a protein that is retained and degraded within the ER when expressed in fibroblasts. Deletion of a 28-amino acid carboxyl terminal sequence, comprising the transmembrane domain and short cytoplasmic tail of TCR-a prevented the rapid degradation of this polypeptide. Fusion of this carboxyl terminal sequence to the extracellular domain of the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (also known as Tac antigen) a membrane protein that is normally transported to the cell surface where it survives long term, resulted in the retention and rapid degradation of the chimeric protein in the ER. Additional mutagenesis revealed that the transmembrane domain of TCR-a alone was sufficient to cause degradation within the ER. Blocking transport out of the ER system with brefeldin A did not lead to degradation of the Tac antigen, indicating that degradation of the chimeric proteins was not a direct consequence of retention in the ER. These observations suggest that a 23 amino acid sequence, including the transmembrane domain of TCR-a, contains information that determines degradation within the ER system.",

Department of Biological Chemisuy, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024-1737 and AMGen, 1900 Oak Terrace Lane, Thousand Oaks, CA 91 320. In order to investigate the basis for the retention of the Pgalactoside a2,6 sialylmsferase (ST) within the Golgi apparatus, we have expressed and localized both wild type and mutant forms of the ST in Chinese hamster ovary and Cos-1 cells. The presence of soluble glycosylmsferases in body fluids suggests that some proportion of glycosyluansferases are released from their membrane anchors by proteolysis. The observation that proteolysis occurs during the purification of the ST from mt liver and results in a 41 kDa form which begins with amino acid 63 of the intact, 47 kDa, Golgi form of the enzyme indicated that some or all of the first 62 aa of the ST, which include a 9 aa, NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail. a 17 aa signal-anchor domain and an extended stem region, may be responsible for the retention of the S T in the Golgi. To directly test this, we replaced the first 57 aa of the S T with the cleavable signal peptide of human yinterferon and expressed this signal peptide-sialyluansferase (spST) fusion protein and wild type S T in CHO cells. While the wild type ST was retained within the cells, the signal peptide was cleaved from the sp-ST fusion protein, resulting in the secretion of a soluble, catalytically active enzyme (t 3/2=2-3 hours). In addition, the wild type S T cDNA was altered by oligonucleotidedirected mutagenesis to conmn a signal peptide cleavage site at the COOH-terminal end of the signal anchor domain. Transient expression of this signal cleavage-ST (sc-ST) in Cos-1 cells demonstrated that this altered enzyme was secreted very slowly from the cells (t1n >24 hours) and the sc-ST enzyme remaining within the cells was predominantly localized to the Golgi apparaNS by immunofluorscence. Another mutant, Atail-ST, which is lacking most of the cytoplasmic tail, behaves like the wild type ST and is localized to the Golgi apparatus in the Cos-1 cells. These preliminary results suggest that the NH terminal stem region contains the \"signal\" required The E3/19K protein of adenovirus type 2 is a resident of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Three segments of amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail constitute the retention signal. Here we show that the same amino acids are A peptide, p34, corresponding to the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminus of the E3/19K protein, stimulates microtubule-protein polymerization and can also induce tubulin polynerization in the absence of microtubuleassociated proteins (MAPS). A high degree of similarity is found between the tubulin-binding repeats of two MAPS and p34. By using peptide variants of p34 we could show that the three amino acid segments necessary for retention of the E3/19K protein coincide with residues needed to induce tubulin-binding and polymerization. Immunofluorescence experiments using antibodies against the C-terminus of the E3/19K protein gave rise to a filament-like pattern in cells transfected with the E3/19K gene. These filaments were found to be localized to microtubules, as revealed by double-staining. Depolymerization of microtubules by nocodazole leads to transformation of the \"E3/19K filaments\" into thicker structures. Similar E3/19K structures were also found in untreated mitotic cells. We suggest that the mechanism for ER retention of the E3/19K protein is mediated by its strong association to the microtubule network. B i d . 105:1205-1214, 1987) showed that the first of the three membrane-spanning domains (ml) may be required for this intracellular retention. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, we have produced single amino acid substitutions in ml to ask if more subtle changes can disrupt the retention signal and result in transport of El to the plasma membrane. These changes were introduced into the wild-type El protein, as well as the deletion mutant Am2.3 which lacks the second and third membrane-spanning domains. We find that several substitutions (hydrophobic for uncharged polar residues) and a small insertion (two isoleucine residues) in the ml domain result in transport of Am2.3 to the plasma membrane. However, these same changes in the full-length El protein do not result in transport to the plasma membrane, and in fact appear to hinder transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest that ml may contain a signal for retention in the Golgi (at least for Am2.3). and may also influence the proper folding of the wild-type El protein. We are currently addressing the mechanism by which these proteins are retained intracellularly.",

Two distinct monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies raised against separate anti-KDEL-peptide (idiotype) antibodies both recognise a 72kD transmembrane protein present in the lumen of the secretory pathway. Rabbit anti-KDEL antisera were found to contain a specific public idiotope recognised by both anti-idiotype monoclonals. Anti-anti-idiotype antisera, generated by immunization of syngeneic mice with fixed anti-idiotype hybridoma cells, recognise a number of -KDEL terminated peptides but not those with -KDELGL termini. By immunofluorescence the antigen is found in a fine cytoplasmic vesicular compartment, which shows perinuclear coalescence in response to a 15\u00b0C block, consistent with a putative recycling retrieval role. The putative receptor has been isolated from anti-idiotype hybridoma cells and found to bind to -KDEL terminated ligands in a [Ca++] and pH dependent manner, but not to the ineffective sequence, -KDELGL. The anti-idiotype secreting hybridoma cells maintain wild type levels of soluble ER proteins and do not leak large amounts of these proteins. They appear to survive by sharply upregulating the expression of the putative receptor. Further results show that the anti-idiotype antibodies recognise a highly conserved (from S. pombe to man), physiologically relevant, -KDEL recognition protein with an inhacellular location consistent with the role of a recycling receptor for the retention of soluble ER proteins. The anti-idiotype reagents and antisera to the isolated protein are now being used to dissect the molecular basis for the retention of soluble resident proteins in the ER.",

Like its mammalian counterparts, yeast BiP mRNA is induced by some types of stress such as tunicamycin (TM), A23187, and accumulation of prefolded and/or precursor proteins in the ER, and further, it is induced by heat shock. To determine which sequences are responsible for these stimuli, we cloned a 1 . 3 Kb upstream region of u coding sequence and fused it with DNA encoding 6-galactosidase gene. Progressivedeletion analysis of this fused gene showed that about 230 bp XhoI-DraI fragment contains all the information required for accurate transcriptional regulation of yeast BiP and indicated that the presence of at least two regions resposive to these stress stimuli.

These mutations were constructed on bacterial plasmids and crossed onto the PRV genome by co-transfection with viral DNA. Recombinant viruses were identified by using the black plaque immunoassay. Immunoprecipitation of infected cell extracts, virions and media from mutant infected cells revealed different localization phentotypes for the mutants. The role of the gIII carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domain in membrane anchoring and protein localization will be discussed. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of the paramyxovirus SV5 is a typical class I1 integral membrane glycoprotein. It contains an uncleaved 19 amino acid amino-proximal signal-anchor domain which orients the protein in the plama membrane with the large carboxyl-terminal domain in the ectoplasm. The folding, oligomerization, and transport of HN was studied following its synthesis in infected cells. Pulsechase labeling and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis indicated that assembly into homotetramers occured with a tIn of 25-30 min. Conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies to HN were characterized and used to probe folded states during maturation. The resident ER protein, GRP7&BiP, was found to be specifically associated with HN during or shortly following synthesis and dissociated when HN reached a folded conformation just prior to oligomerization (t!n, 20-25 min.). The HN protein also exhibited a high rate of turnover (tm, 2-2.5 h) that was not attributable to viral budding. It was found that following the transport to the infected cell surface, HN was specifically sorted for endocytosis away from the other SV5-specific membrane glycoprotein, F, and subsequently transported to lysosomes for degradation. The F glycoprotein was found to be relatively stable and remained at the plasma membrane following transport. PLC was distributed as compact fluorescent foci surrounded by several nuclei. Consistent with PLC fusion in the cell syncytia, a two-fold decrease in cryo-imunogold labelling/ilrn2 for MPR and LIMP-I in PLC was observed. To test if fused PLC functioned as one compartment, 3T3-NFX cell syncytia were labelled with rhodamine dextran for 10 min and then incubated in marker-free media for 50 min; extensive overlap of dextran distribution and fused PLC occurred.",

            "text": "Site-specific mutations in the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of human lysosome membrane glycoprotein h-lamp-1 cDNA identified a tyrosine residue necessary for efficient lysosomal transport of hlamp-1 expressed in COS-1 cells. cDNA encoding a chimeric glycoprotein consisting of the h C G a reporter, the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein transmembrane anchor (G), and the h-lamp-1 cytoplasmic tail (L), designated hCG-a/G/LY, was also efficiently expressed in lysosomes. Substitution of the tyrosine in this chimeric glycoprotein cytoplasmic tail to make the mutant chimera hCG-a /G/LA eliminated lysosomal expression. These data indicate the signal necessary and sufficient for transport to lysosomes is the short, tyrosine-containing cytoplasmic tail of h-lamp-1. The intracellular distribution of h-lamp-1 cytoplamic tail mutants which were not transported to lysosomes was investigated. The carbohydrate portions of these glycoproteins became resistant to endoglycosidase H, indicating transit through the Golgi. Indirect immunofluorescence of the surfaces of live, intact transfeded cells showed that wild type and mutant hlamp-1 glycoproteins can be detected at the plasma membrane. Wild type h-lamp-1 and reporter hCGa /G/LY were efficiently internalized and redistributed to lysosomes, while the mutant glycoproteins lacking tyrosine in the cytoplasmic tail remained at the cell surface. These data suggest lysosomal membrane glycoproteins are transported to lysosomes via the cell surface, and are directed to lysosomes in a process analogous to that used in endocytosis of membrane receptors. Lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (Igp) whose cDNAs have been cloned are all characterized by a heavily glycosylated luminal domain, a single transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail (10-11 amino acids). Among the most conserved features is a glycine-tyrosine tandem in the cytoplasmic tail. Since tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tails of plasma membrane receptors are oflen important for coated pit localization, we assumed that this residue might be important for the targeting of newly synthesized lgps to lysosomes, possibly in specifying concentration in clathrin-coated pits in the Golgi apparatus. Using site-directed mutagenesis we have generated different mutations affecting the cytoplasmic tail of rat Igp 120. The mutant proteins have been stably and transiently expressed in CHO and HeLa cells. We have found that mutations changeing just the tyrosine residue appear to affect the normal intracellular targeting of Igp 120 and to result in transport to the cell surface. The posttranslational processing of the tyrosine-mutated Igp however is similar to the wild-type protein. Unexpectedly, pulse-chase labeling of a tail-deleted lgp 120 has shown that this protein seems to be incompletely glycosylated. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of Igp 120 is essential for the correct sorting of Igp 120 to lysosomes as well as for the addition of complex carbohydrates possibly by directing transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus.The intracellular sorting sites of lgps will be investigated by immunocytochemistry and irnmunoisolation of vesicles using antibodies directed against different components of the bosynthetic pathway. Supported in part by an EMBO fellowship ALTF 360-1988. Department of Biolo ical Sciences, Universi have constructed in-kame fusions between x e 5' end of the PRCl ene and the E.coli GUS gene (uidA). The fusion is via an internal BamHI site in PRCl and a Bamh site upstream from the GUS initiation codon. The CPY domain consists of the s i r 1 peptide, the vacuolar sorting domain and 14 amino acids at the N-terminal end of mature CPY. e fusion protein when expressed in yeast is directed to the vacuole where it forms forms an inactive glyco rotein of approximate1 the same size as native GUS. Site-directed mutagenesis to remove the two ggcosylation sites in GUJrestores activity. Both glycosylation sites are NXS and in the mutants the serine residues have been chan ed to alanine. The mutant fusion protein is sorted to the vacuole in wild-type strains, but is secretefin representative class A, B & C vps strains. Wild-type colonies ex ressing CPY-GUS are white on Xgluc agar whereas vps strains produce blue colonies. The use opthis system to isolate ups mutations and to clone the corresponding VPS genes is discussed. In wild-type yeast strains the sorting of newly synthesized procarboxypeptidase Y (proCPY) is highly efficient. with >95% proCPY being targeted correctly to the vacuole. Mutations in the CPY structural gene, U , have been isolated which result in proCPY missorting and secretion (Valls et al., Cell 48, [887] [888] [889] [890] [891] [892] [893] [894] [895] [896] [897] 1987) . The mutational analysis (Valls, Ph.D. Thesis, 1988) defined a discreet N-terminal vacuolar sorting domain, comprised of amino acids 24-27 of preproCPY (Gln-Arg-Pro-Leu) which is essential for efficient targeting of proCPY to the vacuole. The availability of yeast strains containing mutations in an essential vacuolar targeting domain of proCPY should allow the isolation of pseudorevertants containing conpensatory mutations in the CPY sorting receptor which result in the restoration of efficient vacuolar targeting. Strains carrying missorting alleles of proCPY, such as fRC1-serz7and fRC1-lysz4, secrete 50-80% of their proCPY. These strains have been mutagenized with UV light and screened for the restoration of high levels of intracellular CPY enzyme activity using a plate assay with the CPY substrate N-acetyl-DL-phenylalanine 8-naphthyl ester. Suppression of the mislocalization phenotype was confirmed by quantitative immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled CPY after pulse labeling of cultures with 3 5 S 0 4 and separation into intracellular and extracellular fractions. Mutants exhibiting a suppressed phenotype were subjected to gene substitutions at the f R C l locus, using wild-type and missorting alleles. Two of the mutations isolated were found to suppress all PRCl missorting alleles tested, including the point mutations /ysz4, ser,, arg=, and serz4, as well as a seven amino acid deletion mutation encompassing the sorting domain. One mutation was found to suppress proCPY mislocalization in /ysz4 and ser, , strains only. A yeast strain carrying this allele-specific mutation will be used to clone the suppressor gene. We are studying the vacuole of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system for organelle biogenesis. The vacuole is a large, morphologically complex organelle which is actively partitioned between cells during cell division. Newly synthesized vacuolar proteins are transported to the vacuole through the secretory pathway. The lumen of the vacuole is maintained at an acidic pH by a multisubunit H+-ATPase.",

Two of forty vps complementation groups examined were also defective for acidification of the vacuole. Extensive characterization of one of these genes, the VPS3 gene, has been undertaken. The V f S 3 gene encodes a nonabundant, 140 kD cytoplasmic protein whose sequence lacks similarity to other available sequences. While the gene product associates with pelletable cellular material, it is not associated with purified vacuoles. The gene is nonessential as vps3-A1 deletion mutants are viable. Cytoplasmic subunits of the vacuolar H+-ATPase fail to assemble onto the vacuolar membrane in vpsd-A1 cells, consistent with the acidification defect observed in these strains. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that mother to daughter cell vacuolar segregation, mother cell vacuolar morphology, and daughter cell vacuolar biogenesis are all aberrant in vps3-A1 strains. Temperature shift experiments with a conditional ~p s 3 '~ mutant suggest that the V f S 3 gene product participates directly in protein sorting. We currently favor the hypothesis that the Vpsdp protein is involved in the assembly of peripheral membrane components onto nascent vacuolar membranes. Additional experiments which examine the role of the V f S 3 gene product in the assembly and maintainance of the vacuole will be presented.",

The structure of DPAP A (C. Flanagan and J. Thorner, unpublished) is similar to that of DPAP B in that the two proteins have the same membrane topology, and share a high degree of sequence similarity in their lumenal domains. To determine how two proteins with the same enzymatic activity are localized to distinct compartments within the secretory pathway, the different domains of DPAP A and B have been exchanged. These experiments will also be presented. To increase our understanding of how eukaryotic cells sort proteins in the Golgi and accurately deliver them to the lysosome, we have developed a cell-free transport system to study the movement of proteins from the Golgi to the lysosome-like vacuole in the unicellular eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have chosen to monitor the delivery of a soluble vacuolar glycoprotein. carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), to the vacuole in this in v i m system. CPY Serves as an excellent model protein because its movement from the Golgi to the vacuole is accompanied by a proteolytic processing event. Arrival of CPY at the vacuole can be monitored by determining the amount of the vacuolar form present at the end of the reaction using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We have reconstituted this transport reaction using permeabilized yeast cells. Yeast spheroplasts are labeled with 35Smethionine under conditions which optimize the Golgi form of CPY. The plasma membrane of these spheroplasts is permeabilized by subjecting them to an osmotic shock procedure. This technique results in the release of over 90% of a marker cytoplasmic protein and the retention of over 80% of the lumenal contents of the ER and Golgi within the permeabilized cells. Experiments performed using these permeabilized cells have shown us that transport of CPY from the Golgi to the vacuole is temperature dependent, and requires ATP as well as cytosolic proteins. Transport is efficient, with up to 40% of the Golgi form of the enzyme converted to the vacuolar form within a one hour period of incubation. All forms of CPY present at the initial and final stages of the reaction are localized to cellular compartments protected from exogenously added proteases. When detergent is added at the start of the transport reaction maturation of CPY does not occur, indicating that membrane-limited compartments are required for the transport event to occur. exhibits pleiotropic defects in vacuolar protein targeting and vacuolar morphology. The gene product affected by this mutation may represent a basic ccmponent of the vacuolar protein targeting machinery or may be involved i n the formation of key structural intermediates of the vacuole. To better understand the process of vacuolar protein localization and vacuolar biogenesis, the ~1 6 mutant was used to clone the wild-type allele of the affected gene. Taking advantage of the growth phenotype of one of the ~1 6 mutant alleles, five complementing clones Were isolated from a yeast genomic library, all of which shared related sequences. The complementing activity was further defined and found to be contained on a 2.2 Kb genunic DNA fravnt. Integrative mapping studies have been used to demonstrate that this minimum ccmplementing fragment is tightly linked to the ~1 6 mutant locus. Gene disruption experiments have shown that WS16 is not essential, but rather that the null mutation leads to a g growth defect.",

These antibodies will be used to study the biosynthesis and the subcellular localization of the E l 6 gene product. Plant vacuolar proteins like other secretory proteins enter and are processed through the ER/Golgi/trans-Golgi network. Sorting of yeast and mammalian secretory proteins has been found to be directed by selective retention or targeting information contained within the structure of the protein. Plant, yeast and mammalian proteins lacking sorting information appear to follow a defauk pathway through the secretory system. To understand the mechanisms of protein targeting to the plant vacuole we are attempting to define and characterize the sorting signal@) of the vacuolar protein Barley lectin (BL). BL is synthesized as a preproprotein with a transiently associated glycosylated carboxyl-terminal propeptide which is removed prior to or concomitant with deposition of the mature protein in the vacuole. Expression of a gene for BL in transformed tobacco plants and suspension-cultured cells (NT cells) resuks in the correct processing and accumulation of active mature barley lectin in the vacuole. Similarly, active mature EL is localized within the vacuoles of plants which express a mutated gene of BL where the glcosylation site of the propeptide has been modified to prevent attachment of the high-mannose glycan. Therefore, the glycan domain of the carboxyl-terminal propeptide does not function as a vacuolar sorting determinant. Pulse chase experiments in transgenic tobacco protoplasts however show that the glycan may modulate the rate of processing of the BL proprotein through the Golgi complex. Preliminary resuks show that expression of a mutant gene of BL lacking the carboxyl-terminal propeptide does not resuk in accumulation of BL in transgenic tobacco vacuoles. Therefore the carboxyl-terminal propeptide may function as a vacuolar sorting signal. To test this hypothesis we will determine if the carboxyl-terminal propeptide is sufficient to redirect a cytasolic reporter protein to the vacuole. We have prepared chimeric genes containing the carboxyl-terminal propeptide of BL fused with a cytosolic reporter protein and have transformed the constructs into both plants and NT cells. Analysis of the protein fusions are in progress and will be facilitated by use of the NT cells because of their fast generation times and suitability for organelle fractionation. In animal cells, several steps of membrane traffic are arrested during mitosis. To investigate the mechanism of this regulation, we have used a cell-free assay of endocytic vesicle fusion.",

Fusion was reduced in the presence of mitotic cytosol, when compared to interphase cytosol. More important, fusion inhibition could be reconstituted by complementing interphase cytosol with a purified preparation of the the cell-cycle control protein kinase cdc2. Inhibition was prevented after cdc2 depletion by affinity-binding to the fission yeast protein p l 3 s u c l and restored with the affinity-purified cdc2 kinase. Maximal inhibition (>go%) occured when the cdc-2 activity present in the assay, measured by H1 histone phosphorylation, was in the same range as in mitotic extracts.

The major site of acylation of the human transferrin receptor has been identrfied as cysteine-62. However. the role of acylation at cysteine-62 is unclear because this residue is not conserved in the murine transferrin receptor. Further studies are therefore required in order to identify the sites of acylation and to understand the functional role of transferrin receptor acylation. We performed site-directed mutagenesis of the human transferrin receptor cDNA to replace the potential sites of acylation with serine and alanine residues. Wild-type and mutated human transferrin receptors were expressed In cultured CHO cells that lack functional transferrin receptors (clone TF-1. The properties of the transferrin receptors expressed in CHO cells were investigated by measuring the rates of receptor endocytosis and recycling. It was found that the rate of recycling of the wild-type and mutant receptors were not significantly different. However, the rate of endocytosis of the mutant receptors was markedly greater than that observed for the wild-type transferrin receptor. These results indicate that the covalent modification of the transferrin receptor with palmitate may play a role in the regulation of receptor cycling.",

The two proteins were labeled with a residualizing label ('\"I-or '3'l-tyramine-cellobiose (TC)) in order to follow the degradation products as well as the intact proteins, and kidney tissue was fractionated in sucrose density gradients. Both proteins are cleared from the blood with very similar kinetics; they are filtered in the glometuli and taken up from the ultrafiltrate by receptors in the brush border. Immediately after injection into rats, both proteins showed very similar intracellular distributions. They were found In light vesicles of the same density as the plasma membrane. After 5 min, their distribution profiles started to diverge. '251-TC-cytochrome c and its degradation products were found mainly in the lysosomal region of the gradient; '3'i-TC-lysozyme was transferred into the lysosomes at a much slower rate.

Peter van der Sluijs, Bruno Goudf, and Ira Mellman, Dept. of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510 and (Dept of Immunology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. Endocytic uptake of extracellular ligands is followed by a coordinated series of selective and specific intracellular sorting and fusion events. The mechanisms whereby the cell exerts control over these events depend very likely on as yet unidentified cytoplasmic and membrane associated molecules. We therefore looked at cytoplasmic proteins which associate specifically with endosomes. Highly purified endosomes from CHO cells were isolated by discontinuous sucrose cenhifugation and free flow electrophoresis. Upon incubation with homologous 3%-labeled cytosol, a specific subset of proteins with molecular weights of 19, 21, 46, 49, 85, and 126 kD was bound to endosornes, but not to an irrelevant membrane fraction as analyzed by PAGE and flumgraphy. Currently we are characterizing these proteins and the factors required for binding. In addition we have started to investigate whether isolated endosomes contain GTP binding proteins as these proteins are required for protein transport between compartments of the secretory pathway and also seem to be involved in endosome fusion (Diaz, et al. Nature m: 396, 1989) . Endosomal proteins were resolved by PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting with a panel of anti rab antibodies showed that the purified endosomes contained a YPTlp/SEC4p related rab protein. Probing these blots with a-[32P] GTP showed that the purified endosomes contained two GTP binding proteins with molecular weights of 22.5-25 kD which remained associated with the organelles upon mild trypsin ueatment. We are now investigating the nucleotide specificity and the GTPase activity of these proteins, and whether these proteins are resaicted to a specific class of endosomes. Cytoplasmic domains play an important role in the collection of cell surface receptors into clathrin-coated pits and their subsequent endocytosis. Unlike most receptors, 300kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) are localized primarily in the trans Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes (-95%), and they cycle constitutively between these compartments. Yet, when present at the cell surface, MPRs are internalized together with other cell surface receptors in clathrin-coated vesicles. We constructed a chimeric receptor to test whether the MPR cytoplasmic domain contained sufficient information to direct a cell surface receptor into both of these transport pathways. Molecular cloning techniques were used to precisely join the human EGF receptor extracellular and transmembrane domains with the cytoplasmic domain of the bovine MPR. The expressed chimeric protein formed a stable structure with a half life of -20 hr, bound EGF with high affinity (Kd-0.9X10-9M), and was efficiently endocytosed and recycled back to the cell surface. If the cytoplasmic domain alone is responsible for sorting native MPRs, chimeric receptors might have been expected to be located primarily in the TGN and in endosomes at steady state. To our suxprise, while endogenous MPRs were essentially all intracellular, >85% of the chimeric receptors were located at the cell surface. Chimeric receptors were not napped at the surface because they internalized and-EGF receptor Fab fragments in the presence or absence of EGF. These experiments demonstrate that the MPR cytoplasmic domain is not sufficient to alter the steady state dismbution of the EGF receptor, and suggest a role for MPR extracellular and transmembrane domains in the cellular routing of this receptor. We propose that these MPR domains contain an \"endosome retention\" signal that facilitates the movement of this receptor from early to late endosomes, thereby facilitating its return to the TGN. Mannose-terminated glycoproteins, asialoorosomucoid and air-filled albumin microspheres (AIbunex') arc selectively taken up by endocytosis in rat liver endothelial, parenchymal and Kupffcr cells, respectively. The intracellular transport and degradation of endocytosed material were studied by means of subcellular fractionation $,sucrose and Nycodenz gradients following intravenous injection of the ligand. By using ligands labelled with 1-tyramine-cellobiose the subcellular distribution of labelled degradation products could be studied, since they are trapped at the site of formation (e.g. lysosomes).",

The chimeric proteins in which domains were precisely exchanged were productively targeted to the cell surface. We also analyzed the subunit composition of the wt and the chimeric plycoproteins. The influenza NA and TR were present as a homotetramer and a homodimer, respectively. However, NATFUSO, in which the cytoplasmic and anchor domains of NA were appended to the ectodomain of TR, was present as tetramer, dimer, as well as monomer. TRNAa35, in which the cytoplasmic and anchor domains of TR were joined to the ectodomain of NA, existed predominantly as a dimer, suggestin that the cytoplasmic and anchor domains of type II glycoproteins might affect the subunit assem9bly of the ectodomains. We also analyzed the role of cytoplasmic domain in endocytic uptake. TR but not NA was capable of being sequestered into coated pits and internalized. The chimera NATFU90 failed to undergo endocytosis whereas TRNAa35 was internalized, albeit inefficiently. These studies reinforced the importance of cytoplasmic domain in receptor recycling pathway and also showed that the NH cytoplasmic domain of a type II membrane protein alone possesses sufficient and necessary inform&on to direct a heterologous extracellular domain into the endocytic vesicles.

The rate of endocytosis of the human transferrin receptor was significantly faster than the hamster receptor. In order to examine the molecular basis for the difference between the observed rates of endocytosis. a hamster transferrin receptor cDNA clone was isolated. The predicted primary sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of the hamster transferrin receptor is identical to the human receptor except at residue 20 where a tyrosine in the human sequence is replaced with cysteine. To test the hypothesis that this structural change in the receptor is related to the difference in the rate of internalization we used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the effect of the replacement of tyrosine20 with a cysteine residue in the human transferrin receptor. It was observed that the substitution of tyrosine20 with cysteine caused a 62% inhibition of the rate of iron accumulation by cells incubated with [59Fe]diferric transferrin. No significant difference between the rate of internalization of the mutant (cysteinezo) human receptor and the hamster receptor was observed. Thus, the substitution of tyrosine20 with a cysteine residue can account for the difference between the rate of endocytosis of the human and hamster transferrin receptors. There has long been morphological evidence that secretory cells recycle membrane components from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus following exocytosis. Recently it has been shown that fibroblast and lymphoma cell lines can selectively recycle the mannose-&phosphate receptor from the cell surface to the Golgi apparatus (Duncan, J. R. and S. Komfeld, J Cell Biol. m:617). To compare this membrane pathway in regulated secretory cells and fibroblastic cells, we have selected a variant of the neuroendocrine PC12 cell line for its resistance to rich. The variant cells are deficient in terminal galactose addition to their glycoproteins, making them useful for the study of glycoprotein aaffic from the plasma membrane to the trans Golgi network, the site of sialic acid addition, as described by Duncan and Komfeld We have found that PC12 cells recycle a larger number of cell surface proteins to the Golgi apparatus than do CHO fibroblasts. The recycling is blocked at 18OC. In addition, we have found that the synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptophysin (p38) follows this route at least twice as efficiently as total cell surface proteins. We are currently comparing the recycling of synaptophysin with specific markers for other membrane compartments including the plasma membrane and dense core secretory vesicles. The assay consisted of hemolymph transplants between the different species. The results of experiments using these two approaches are presented.",

FcRII-Bl and -82 are identical, except for a 47 amino acid insert in the cytoplasmic tail of 81. 81 does not localize in coated pits and is poorly internalized. A tail-minus mutant, with only one amino acid in the cytoplasmic tail Is similar to 81 with respect to coated pit localization and internalization efficiency. Taken together these results suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of 82 contains a domain that is necessary for coated pit localization and subsequent endocytosis. Cytoplasmic tails of many receptors have been shown to contain a tyrosine residue that is critical for coated pit localization. The cytoplasmic tail of 82 contains two tyrosines (positions 26 and 43) and that of B1 contains three tyrosines (positions 28, 54 and 73). To investigate whether the tyrosine in position 26 of 82 is critical for endocytosis, it was mutated to an alanine. Conversely, a glycine in position 26 of BI was mutated to a tyrosine to examine whether this would allow endocytosis of this receptor. Preliminary results using immunofluorescence of transiently-expressing COS cells suggest that the Tyr26 in 82 is not required for endocytosis and that the acquired TyR6 in B1 is not sufficient to allow endocytosis. Carboxy-terminus deletion mutants of 82 with 18 (CT18) or 31 (CT31) amino acids remaining in the cytoplasmic tail were also internalized relatively efficiently, with CT31 being somewhat faster than CT18. This indicates that neither the membrane-proximal tyrosine nor the domain surrounding it is necessary for internalization. We are now in the process of making stably transfected Copenhagen N, Denmark. In Vero cells cytochalasin D was found to reduce the endocytosis of ricin and the fluid phase markers [14C]sucrose and lucifer yellow without reducing the uptake of transferrin. The number of coated pits at the plasma membrane was not affected by the treatment. Cytochalasin D also reduced the endocytosis of ricin in acidified cells where uptake of transferrin from coated pits was blocked by low cytosolic pH. In A431 cells EGF and TPA increased the endocytic uptake of ricin both under normal culture conditions and when the coated pit/coated vesicle pathway was blocked by acidification of the cytosol. In contrast, EGF and TPA had no stimulatory effect on the uptake of transferrin at normal cytoplasmic pH, and EGF and TPA did not abolish the ability of low cytoplasmic pH to inhibit endocytic uptake of transferrin. The results indicate that cytochalasin D selectively inhibits endocytic uptake from non-clathrin coated areas of the cell membrane whereas EGF and TPA stimulate it. The data therefore support the view that there are different endocytic mechanisms, and the results suggest that at least in some cell types one can modulate non-clathrin coated endocytosis.",

A cytosolic phosphoglycoprotein conta2ning.phosphodiester-linked Glc with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 63 kDa (pgp63) has been implicated in the regulated secretory processes of Paramecia and PCl2 cells. addition, antibodies against the Paramecium protein cross-react with pgp63 in rat liver, a constitutively secretin organ. Incubation of wild-type (strain X2180-1A) yeast homogenate with the 95S-labeled 8-phosphorothioate analogue of UDP-Glc results in the labeling of a single protein of approximately the same molecular mass. This phosphoglycoprotein shows similar PI and chemical characteristics to Paramecia, PC12, and rat liver pgp63. Yeast secretory mutants were screened for the pgp63' phenotype. mutants (sec 3-2, sec 4-2, and sec 8-6) associated with a late secretory event displayed a pgp63-phenotype in homogenate assays. Analyses of highly back-crossed sec 3, 4, and 8 strains (from P. Novick), however, showed a pgp63' phenotype. mutants was derived from NPlR, a spontaneous Gal' hypersecretory revertant of X2180-lA. The involvement of pgp63 in the regulated secretory systems mentioned above, together with the results in yeast, suggest a possible gating role for pgp63 in the constitutive yeast Secretory pathway.",

Sec4p associated with the cytoplasmic aspect of vesicles can reach the plasma membrane through the exocytic pathway and recycle through a small soluble pool back to this compartment. Phenotypic analysis of mutations in supports the hypothesis that superimposed on this cycle of protein localization is a cycle of guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. The alteration in the conformation of vesicular Sec4p resulting from the binding of GTP could, for example, facilitate an interaction with a plasma membrane effector which would terminate upon hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide. In order to determine the mechanism of action of the protein, we have purified the soluble form of Sec4p from a yeast strain overproducing it. Sec4p binds GDP, GTP and triphosphate analogs in the presence of micromolar concentrations of free magnesium ions by exchange with prebound GDP. The enhanced stability of the GTP bound form of the protein is reflected in a 20-fold higher affinity for GTP over GDP, a decreased rate of nucleotide dissociation and an extremely low intrinsic GTPase activity. Based on the model of Sec4p function, it could be predicted that protein factors exist which could stabilize the inactive conformation of the protein, or stimulate nucleotide exchange or hydrolysis. In support of this, we have detected an activity in a yeast soluble fraction which will inhibit the binding of a radiolabeled triphosphate analog to Sec4p. Further characterization of this factor and its possible role in the Sec4p-mediated cycle of regulation of vesicular transport is currently underway.

GTP-blotting experiments have revealed that several cytosolic low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (LMW GTPBPs) accumulate on Golgi membranes during our in vitro intra-Golgi transport reaction. These proteins are not appreciably present on the membranes prior to their inclusion in the reaction, and significant binding occurs only in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPyS during incubation at 37 OC, conditions which also cause an accumulation of non-clathrin-coated transport vesicles. An improved vesicle purification allows the assignment of at least four LMW GTPBPs as vesicle constituents; using immunoblotting, one vesicle LMW GTPBP has been shown to be ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF). ARF, an abundant protein present in a wide variety of tissues, was originally identified as a cofactor required in the cholera-toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the alpha subunit of Gs. Preliminary studies indicate that ARF is enriched in the vesicles relative to incubated Golgi membranes and is present at many molecules per vesicle. Thus ARF is the first identified mammalian LMW GTPBP found to be a transport vesicle component. Donor\" Golgi membranes are derived from the glycosylation mutant Lec2, deficient in the Golgi CMP-S,ialic acid transporter. In these cells the major glycolipid is lactosyl-ceremide. The acceptor\" Go1g.i are derived from Lec8 cells, deficient in the UDP-Gal transporter, where the major glyco ipid IS lucosyl ceremide. The transport of lactosyl-ceremide from donor to acceptor results in the ?ormation of the ganglioside GM3 (sialic acid-lactosyl-ceremide). The transport reaction is dependent on ATP, elevated temperature, intact Golgi membranes, cytosolic proteins, and is inhibited by GTPyS. Furthermore the reaction depends on the Nethylmaleimide sensitive factor previously shown t o participate in protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, throu h the Golgi, and in endocytosis. The transport of glycolipid and protein was measurei in the same set of membranes, allowing precise comparison of the kinetics of transport t o the trans Golgi. The kinetics of transport were identical for protein and lipid transport. These data indicate that glycoproteins and glycolipids are transported through the Golgi by similar or identical mechanisms.",

It is present in cells in dimeric and larger (probably hexameric) form. In NRK cells grown at 37oC p58 was found in tubulovesicular elements seen in the Golgi region and in cis Golgi and occasionally also in the cell periphery. Some p58 was also detectable in the ER. In cells shifted to low temperature (16OC) the accumulation of a large number of these p58-containing peripheral elements was observed. They were shown to be intermediates in biosynthetic protein transport by colocalizing p58 and a viral membrane protein. arrested between the ER and the Golgi complex at 15OC, in BHK-21 cells. Low temperature apparently causes the accumulation of pre-Golgi elements by slowing down their movement since if the cells were returned to 37oC a rapid translocation of these elements to the Golgi region was observed. Nowdazole inhibited this translocation process suggesting that the movement of pre-Golgi elements requires the integrity of microtubules. Brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal antibiotic which blocks protein transport between the ER and Golgi complex, induced the redistribution of p58 to reticular ER elements (including the nuclear membrane). In the presence of BFA p58 also accumulated in tubulovesicular structures throughout the perinuclear ER region which apparently represent the sites where BFA affects protein transport. These results indicate that the transport of proteins from ER to Golgi is not restricted to a region adjacent to the Golgi complex but occurs from multiple transitional sites within the perinuclear ER network. As our data suggests that p58 may continuously cycle between the ER and Golgi, we are currently using immunoelectron microscopy to possibly identify the elements which function in the recycling process.",

I n conaast, secl9 cells accumulate a variety of membranous suuctures including ER and Golgi membranes and secretory vesicles. We have reconstituted the secZ3 and secl9 defects m u s i n g an ER to Golgi transport assay consisting of membrane and cytosolic fractions prepared from mutant cells. The efficiency o f ER to Golgi transpoq at the permissive temperature in this assay i s reduced four to five-fold by preincubation of secl9 cytosol at 30 C or secl3 cytosol at 36'C. Preincubation of membrane components has little effect on transport, suggesting that the secZ9 and secl3 defects are primarily cytosolic. In addition, both the secZ9 and secZ3 defects can be rescued completely by the addition of wild type cytosol to mutant membranes. Complementation o f the ER to Golgi transport defect will be used as an activity assay in the purification o f the Secl3 and Secl9 proteins. I n order to better characterize the mutations, we have also cloned the SEC13 and SECI9 genes. The SECI3 gene i s 1.3 kB in length. Antibodies raised against a a Secl3 fusion protein recognize a 34kD protein that i s overproduced in wild type stains carrying a multicopy plasmid containing the SEC13 gene. We have recently isolated a 5 kB DNA fragment that rescues both temperature-sensitive growth and ER to Golgi uansport i n sec 19 when present on a single copy plasmid. We are currently characterizing the putative SEC19 gene using molecular genetic techniques. Cytosolic antigens must be partially degraded, transported into the lumen of the vacuolar system and form complexes with MHC molecules before they can be presented to the antigen receptor on cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). For class I restricted antigens this process is insensitive to inhibitors of lysosomal degradation, such as chloroquine, and blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis, thus it has been called endogenous to distinguish it from the exogenous pathway in which soluble protein antigens are taken up into endosomes where they are partially degraded and form complexes with MHC molecules. Using the drug Brefeldin A we have previously shown that the endogenous pathway of class I restricted presentation is dependent on protein transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These results imply that the ER may be the site where class I MHC and processed antigen first combine. Previous attempts to define an endogenous pathway for a class 11 restricted cytoplasmic antigen, such as Influenza A matrix protein, have been hindered by an inability to establish an infection in the absense of endocytosis and endosomal acidification. When normal endocytosis is allowed to take place, exogenous antigen processing also occurs. In order to delineate a non-endosomal, endogenous pathway for presenting this cytosolic antigen, we used a technique which allows direct fusion of virus particles with the presenting cell's plasma membrane. Under these conditions matrix protein is presented to class I1 restricted CTL in a chloroquine-insensitive manner. This process is blocked by Brefeldin A, implying a strict requirement for protein transport from the ER in this process and suggesting that the ER may in fact be the site of antigen-MHC assembly in class I1 restricted endogenous antigen presentation as well. The characteristics of Brefeldin A (BFA)-induced retrograde movement of Golgi proteins into the ER and its relationship to an ER retrieval pathway were investigated. Retrograde movement of Golgi into the ER occurred by a mechanism involving the extension of numerous, long, tubulo-vesicular processes out of the Golgi along microtubules which then fused with the ER. Microtubule disrupting agents (i.e. nocodazole), energy poisons and reduced temperatures (<16OC) inhibited this pathway. Although pretreatment of cells with nocodazole blocked retrograde movement of Golgi proteins, if these proteins were first transported to the ER by BFA, subsequent addition of nocodazole had a surprising effect: the ER was cleared of the Golgi markers which accumulated in structures which co-localized with a 53 kD protein normally associated with intermediate transport vesicles between the ER and Golgi. These results were consistent with the movement of Golgi proteins in the presence of BFA through an ER cycling pathway whose retrograde arm is microtubuledependent. To determine whether such an ER cycling pathway is followed by any proteins in the absence of BFA, we studied the dynamics of the 53 kD marker. At 16OC. the 53 kD protein redistributed into a central structure closely associated with the Golgi and into long, tubulo-vesicular processes extending out of it. Upon addition of BFA at 16OC Golgi proteins entered the tubular processes marked by the 53 kD protein. These results suggested that BFA induces the interaction of the Golgi with a nearby intermediate, recycling compartment enabling the Golgi to enter retrograde tubulo-vesicular processes that leads to fusion with the ER.",

Apolipoprotein E (apo-E) and B (apo-8) are the major protein components of mammalian very low density (VLDL) and low density (LDL) lipoproteins. They maintain the structural integrity of these particles and mediate their clearance from the vascular system by receptor mediated endocytosis. The mechanisms that lead to the formation of these lipid rich particles are of relevance to the causes of hypercholesterolemia as well as being of intrinsic interest. We have expressed the apo-E gene and domains of the apo-B gene in the simple eukaryote S. cerevisiue, and are developing a novel system for the analysis of lipoprotein particle assembly. We have found that secretion of apo-E by yeast requires a host mutation conferring sterol uptake (upc2, uptake of cholesterol). Contrary to our expectations, secretion occurs only when the mutant cells are grown in the absence of sterol. Wild-type or upc2 strains repleted of sterol do not secrete apo-E. We propose that the upc2 defect relieves a blockage to lipoprotein secretion and that this deficiency is overcome by the provision of sterol. Similarly, the putative receptor binding domains of apo-B are secreted at higher levels in the upc2 host deprived of sterol than in wild-type strains. The secreted polypeptides bind to the LDL receptor and therefore are presumed to be in an active conformation. Additionally, we have expressed N-terminal regions of apo-B that have a strong affinity for lipid and are currently analysing particle formation by these polypeptides. This combination of classical and molecular yeast genetics is providing a unique opportunity to analyse lipoprotein biogenesis.

Except for IL-10 whose secretion was directed by the signal peptide of the K. lactis killer toxin a subunit, it is demonstrated that the natural human exportation signals from these proteins are functional in Kluvveromvces. In addition, analysis of the N-terminal sequence of secreted HSA and IL-15 revealed equally efficient removal of the signal sequence, regardless whether a human or a yeast signal was used. Whereas expression of Met-tPA and Met-IL-15 yielded unglycosylated proteins accumulating in the cytoplasm, heavily glycosylated material was obtained when expressing prepro-tPA, pre-TIMP and pre-IL-lO. Glycosylation of recombinant IL-15 (which does not occur in mammalian cells) causes the loss of 90 % of its biological activity as monitored in a lymphocyte activation assay and this activity can be fully restored by treatment with endoglycosidase H. The fact that recombinant HSA which is devoid of carbohydrate residues is secreted at levels well above those observed with IL-15, TIMP or tPA raises the possibility that hyperglycosylation might interfere with efficient protein secretion in Kluvveromvces yeasts.",

Analogous to cleavage of prohormones and neuropeptide precursors such as proinsulin and proopiomelanocortin, the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiue) Kex2 protease cleaves pro-a-factor and prokiller toxin, during their transit of the secretory pathway, at the carboxyl side of Lys-Arg and Arg-Arg dipeptides. In order to identify the innacellular site of processing in yeast, we have characterized posttranslational modifications of the protease and examined its inhacellular dismbution using indirect immunofluorescence. Pulse-chase/immunoprecipitation studies, combined with analysis of carbohydrate and of secretory (sec) mutants, demonstrate that Kex2 protease undergoes rapid (I 1 min) Asn-(N-) and S e r f h -(0-) glycosylation and signal peptide cleavage upon translocation into the ER. A second proteolytic processing step occurs within 1-2 min, requires prior signal peptidase action and corresponds to removal of an amino-terminal pro-peptide of about 9-10 kDa. Subsequent uanspon to the Golgi occurs within 4 min and is marked by extension of 0-linked oligosaccharide. This is followed by a slow increase in Mr due to addition of a-1.3-linked mannose residues to 0-linked chains. The latter result shows that for the duration of the lifetime of the enzyme (tin-90 min), mature K e d protein is accessible to the a-1,3linked mannosyl transferase which is thought to reside in a late compartment of the Golgi. Indirect immunofluorescence shows that, consistent with previous results [R.S. Fuller, A. Brake and J. Thorner (1989) Science, in press], Kex2 protein is an inuacellular molecule. The protein is localized in a punctate fashion to multiple bodies (3-10/cell) that are distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the yeast cell, without association with the nucleus or other identifiable organelle.

Markey Scholar award and N M grant GM39697 to R.S.F., an NIH predoctoral fellowship to C.W. and an NSF predoctoral fellowship to K.R. The allele responsible for lethality of A c h c l in this strain, which is unlinked to C H C l , has been called S C D l (suppressor of clarhrin deficiency)'. Recently, a second strain (W303) has been found in which the A c h c l mutation is lethal and we are currently investigating whether this lethality is due to a single allele. Studies in this lab have been undertaken using a construct in which C H C l expression is controlled by the repressible G A L l promoter and these studies have shown that the G A L I -C H C I construct spares A c h c l strains from the lethality associated with SCDl and the allele(s) in W303, even under conditions where the G A L l promoter is repressed. The growth of the S C D l and W303 strains carrying A c h c l and G A L l -C H C l is, however, extremely poor under repressive conditions. The extremely poor growth phenotype associated with both SCDl and the W303 allele(s) in A c h c l G A L l -C H C l backgrounds is recessive to the slow growth phenotype of alleles present in strains which survive C H C I deletion, and preliminary complementation and segregation data suggest that SCDl and the allele(s) in W303 may affect distinct genes. Mutant yeast cells with a deletion 01 the clathrin heavy chain (CHC) gene, among other detects. grow more slowly than wild type cells, secrete a high molecular-weight lorm of unprocessed a-factor, and mislocalize Kex2 endoprotease to the cell surface. To distinguish between primary defects caused by the clathrin defciency and secondary detects that might arise after deletion of the gene, a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation in the CHCI gene was generated by in nrro mutagenesis with hydroxylamine. The mutation responsible for temperaturesensitiilty has been mapped to the 3 end of the gene. This region of the gene is now being sequenced. The 1s mutation was introduced into the chromosomal CHCI gene and the resulting strain was characterized. At 23\"C, both stains had a doubling time 01 2.4 h. When cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C. five hours elapsed before a growth defect became apparent in the mutant cells. At this time the mutant cells had a doubling time of 2.1 h compared to 1.5 h for wild type cells. Maturation of a-factor was assessed after mutant cells were subjected to a 30 min preincubation and then a 30 min metabolic labeling with [%I amino acids at 37\u00b0C. lmmuneprecipitation of secreted a-factor revealed that the 1s strain secreted only unprocessed a-factor and no mature a-factor. Since the detect in a-factor processing occurred long before a defect in growth was detected. these data imply that mislocalization of Kex2 endoprotease and the resulting secretion of high molecular weight, unprocessed a-factor by clathrin-deficient strains occurs rapidly atter loss of clathrin function. Coated pits and vesicles are dynamic membrane organelles responsible for receptor-mediated pathways of intracellular transport. Clustering of receptor-ligand complexes at the plasma membrane is associated w i t h the copolymerization of two classes of proteins on the cytoplasmic face of these organelles. The outer layer is comprised of triskelions containing clathrin heavy and light chains and the inner layer is a complex of assembly polypeptides which are thought to bind to receptors and facilitate the assembly of clathrin. Prominent among these assembly polypeptides are a heterogenous group of lOOkd polypeptides, called adaptins, that are postulated to be adaptor molecules which conjoin receptors to clathrin. Three distinct adaptin families (a, 8, y) have been characterized. They form two adaptor complexes that localize to distinct regions of the cell: one to the Golgi complex, the other to the plasma membrane. We have cloned the cDNA encoding the B adaptin of the plasma membrane adaptor. The predicted structure of the 937 amino acid protein is identical between rat and human. This remarkable conservation contrasts with the absence of significant sequence similarity between the a and !3 families of adaptins. Diversity within each adaptin family is created by the expression of different genes and by tissue-specific differential splicing. The structure of ! 3 and a adaptins can be divided into two globular domains connected by a variable and potentially flexible stalk domain.

The clathrin light chains, LCa and LCb, have properties which suggest that they may be regulatory elements of clathrin assembly and/or disassembly, however their exact functions are unknown. Studies in a human B lymphocyte cell line have revealed that much more LCa than LCb is synthesized in a four hour period (Brodsky, JCB 101:2055 (1985 ). To determine if LCa has a more rapid rate of turnover than LCb, the half-lives of the clathrin subunits were determined by pulse-chase studies. Half-lives of 24 hours, 45 hours, and 49 hours were determined for LCa, LCb, and the heavy chain, respectively. These results indicate that all clathrin subunits are sufficiently long-lived to undergo numerous rounds of endocytosis. Additionally, since the half-life of LCa is about half that of both LCb and the heavy chain, it is unlikely that the clathrin triskelion turns over strictly as a unit. Although LCa has a considerably shorter half-life than LCb, the difference in their half-lives is insufficient to explain the very large difference in their rates of synthesis. Quantitative studies of the light chains confirmed that this B lymphoctye cell line expresses much more LCa than LCb (approx. a 6:l ratio). This finding prompted further investigation of the ratios of light chains in different tissues and cell lines. Of the tissues tested, most revealed a 1:l LCa to LCb ratio. Brain tissue was the major exception, having at least twice as much LCb as LCa. In contrast to the tissues, the two cell lines tested showed a very large LCa to LCb ratio (approx. 6:l). Preliminary results indicate that the light chain ratios of assembled clathrin are the same as that of total cellular clathrin.

This localization was confirmed by cleavage of purified M protein at asp-pro linkages (residues 5 4 -5 5 ) with formic acid, and by cleavage at tryptophan residues with N-chlorosuccinimide. An amphipathic helix of 2-3 turns is proposed as the membranepenetrating structure.",

It has recently been shown that class I molecules function as receptors that bind peptide ligands, thus potentiating the immune recognition of virus-infected or malignant cells by cytotoxic T cells. Considerable evidence supports the role of P2m in the conformation, intracellular transport or surface expression of class I molecules. However, the precise nature and critical time that P2m must interact with class I has not been defined. Futhermore, Townsend et al. recently reported evidence suggesting peptide ligand facilitates the assembly of class I with P2m. To dissect the various factors influencing class I synthesis, we are studying the Ld class I molecule of the mouse. Our findings indicate that increased production of P2m does not significantly alter Ld conformation or surface expression. However, culturing cells in the presence of an Ld-specific peptide led to a substantial increase in surface expression of Ld molecules.

IDepartment of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Haward Medical School, Boston MA 021 15. 2Department of Molecular Biology, University of California, Berkeley CA 94720. We have used the alkaline phosphatase fusion technique to characterize determinants of membrane protein topological structure. When alkaline phosphatase is fused to the periplasmic domain of a cytoplasmic membrane protein, it is effectively exported to the penplasm. Such a hybrid protein exhibits high alkaline phosphatase activity. When alkaline phosphatase is fused to the cytoplasmic domain of a membrane protein, it remains, for the most part, in the cytoplasm. Such fusions exhibit low enzymatic activity. However, stable retention of alkaline phosphatase in the cytoplasm requires the presence in the fusion protein of the cytoplasmic loop ordinarily present in that position in the native, unfused protein. We have used oligonucleotidedirected mutagenesis to show that that positively charged amino acids are required for the stable cytoplasmic localization of the fused alkaline phosphatase. W e propose that, in addition to hydrophobic transmembrane segments, positively charged amino acids in the hydrophilic cytoplasmic domains of a membrane protein are determinants of the protein's topology. The N terminus of the F, subunit of the paramyxovirus SV5 fusion protein (fusion related external domain, FRED) is a hydrophobic domain that is implicated in mediating membrane fusion. We have examined the ability of the FRED to function as a combined signal-anchor domain by substituting it for the natural Nterminal signal-anchor domain of a model type I1 integral membrane protein: the influenza virus neuraminidase. The hybrid protein (NAF) was expressed in eukaryotic cells. The FRED was shown to act as a signal sequence, targeting NAF to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), by the fact that NAF acquired N-linked carbohydrate chains. NAF is a soluble protein in the lumen of the ER and the results of N-terminal sequence analysis showed that the FRED is cleaved at a site predicted to be recognized by signal peptidase.",

Upon in vitro-translation in the presence of microsomes, the first hydrophobic domain functions as a signal and the second as a stoptransfer sequence, while the third initiates a second translocation process, halted again by the fourth. [Ref. 1) . We replaced the third transmembrane segment by a normally cleaved amino-terminal signal sequence of influenza virus hemagglutinin. Efficient cleavage was observed, demonstrating that processing by signal peptidase is not necessarily restricted to the first hydrophobic domain of nascent proteins [Ref. 21. Twofold membrane-spanning constructs with a set of different hydrophobic domains in the second position were used to study the characteristics of stop-transfer sequences. We discovered that some behave differently depending on the translation system used. Expression in fibroblasts showed that the reticulocyte lysate system reflects more closely the in vivo situation than the wheat germ system. Recently it has been proposed that the difference in the charges of the 15 residues flanking a first internal signalanchor determines its orientation in the membrane upon insertion [Ref. 31. Currently we are testing this hypothesis by systematically altering the membrane-flanking charged residues in H1. Both the cellular and scrapie isoforms of the prion protein (PrP) designated PrPC and PrPSC are encoded by a single-copy chromosomal gene and appear to be translated from the same 2.1-kb mRNA. PrPC can be distin uished from PrPSC by limited proteolysis under conditions where PrPC is hydrolyzed and PrP\" is resistant. We report here that PrPC can be released from the surface of both normal-control and scrapie-infected murine neuroblastoma (N2a) cells by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) digestion and it can be selectively labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin, a membrane-impermeant reagent. In contrast, PrPSC was neither released by PIPLC nor labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin. ments showed that [ 3 5 S incorporation into PrPgC molecules was observed only during the chase period. While PrPC is synthesized and degraded relatively rapidly (tk -5 h), PrPSC is synthesized slowly (tk -15 h) and appears to accumulate. These results are consistent with several observations previously made on rodent brains where PrP mRNA and PrPC levels did not change throughout the course of scrapie infection, yet PrPSC accumulated to levels exceeding that of PrPC. Our kinetic studies demonstrate that PrPSC is derived from a protease-sensitive precursor and that the acquisition of proteinase K resistance results from a post-translational event. Whether or not prolonged incubation periods which are a cardinal feature of prion diseases reflect the slow synthesis of PrPSC remains to be established.",

Concomitantly, spectrin is released from its normal residence in the region of the basolateral plasma membrane and observed throughout the cytoplasm. The reorganization takes place in 10 minutes and the pH treshold is 6.0 -6.2. The phenomenon is reversible and spectrin is reassembled at the basolateral membranes in less than 10 minutes after restoring a normal pH. Other cytoskeletal components (tubulins, vimentin and actin) remain immobile during acidification of the cells. The lack of cellcell contacts and the diffuse distribution of spectrin in acidified cells is similar to hat observed in freshly plated epithelial cells or cells grown in a low Cat+ medium.The results show a close association between regulatory proton and calcium ion gradients and the organization of cell-cell contacts and the spectrin-based membrane skeleton. While many examples of gene regulation occurring at the level of translation are evident throughout the literature, such as alterations in either translation initiation rate, polypeptide elongation rate, translation termination rate, or the stability of translating mRNAs, as well as the segregation of particular mRNAs to specific subcellular domains, there is little data illuminating the molecular mechanisms governing these events. However, given that the majority of ribosomes engaged in translation are found associated with the cytoskeletal framework, it is intriguing to speculate that the cytoskeleton may play an active role in regulating both the extent and locale of gene expression. We have, therefore, developed a cytoskeletal-based protein synthesizing system from cultured mouse cells to aid in examining the molecular basis for such regulatory events. By using a low concentration of nonionic detergent to gently extract cells while they are still adherent to a substrate, and avoiding such desauctive preparative techniques as cellular homogenization and high speed centrifugation, we have obtained a system that is devoid of membraneous barriers yet retains much the same topological arrangement of mRNA, ribosomes and cytosmcture that exists ''in &\". Preliminary data indicate that when this system is supported by soluble factors from a reticulocyte lysate, it is capable of continually translating endogenous, cytoskeletal-bound mRNAs for at least 40 minutes. Emulsion autoradiography of ongoing protein synthesis demonstrates that protein synthetic activity is ubiquitous throughout the population of extracted cells, and not confined to a possibly less well extracted subset. SDS-PAGE reveals that the pattern of proteins produced by such extracted cells is identical to that produced by unextracted cells, including proteins of molecular weight greater than 200Kd. Furthermore, a continued increase in intensity of almost all proteins during this time period strongly suggests that translational reinitiation is also taking place. This system should prove useful in examining the role the cytoskeleton plays in the subcellular compartmentalization of mRNA and in regulating gene expression.",

We have shown that the SACl gene product of 5. cerevisiae significantly influences the states of both the yeast secretory pathway (at the level of Golgi function) and the yeast actin cytoskeleton. As a result, we investigated the distribution of Saclp in the yeast cell. Using a TrpE-Sac1 fusion protein, we have generated monoclonal antibodies to Saclp. Saclp is an unglycosylated polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 65Kd. Subcellular fractionation experiments have indicated that Saclp is found exclusively in the 12,OOOxg and 100,OOOxg pellet fractions. Evidence indicating Saclp to be an integral membrane protein is obtained by our observation that Saclp is not efficiently extracted from membranes by treatment with Na2C03, pH 11.5. Saclp amino acid sequence indicates that Saclp does exhibit an excellent candidate for a potential membrane-spanning domain. Preliminary results of protease protection experiments, employing cell lysates in which the integrity of small organelles Is maintained, show that most of Saclp is resistant to digestion by proteinase K in the absence of detergent, while Saclp is completely digested in the presence of detergent. This result suggests that Saclp may have both a cytoplasmic and a lumenal domain. Department of Entomology; Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843. Nuclear targeting signals have been identified in a number of proteins encoded by mammalian viruses. Thew usually consist of several basic amino acids, often flanked by proline residues. Nuclear targeting signals in some yeits proteins are different, with a core of three hydrophobic amino acids flanked on both sides by basic amino acids. We have identified a nuclear targeting signal in a baculovirusencoded protein, polyhedrin, which accumulates in huge amounts in the nuclei of infected insect cells. Increasing lengths of the polyhedrin coding sequence were fused in-frame to a sequence encoding the cytoplasmic protein, E-galactosidase @-gal). Each hybrid gene was engineered into a recombinant baculovirus and expressed in infected insect cells. The subcellulardismbution of the fusion products was determined by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-&gal as the probe. Fusion proteins containing polyhedrin amino acids 1 to 11,22,25 or 28 were cytoplasmic, while those containing amino acids 1 to 30,57 or 110 were nuclear. These observations were extended by biochemical fractionation of the infected cells followed by immunoprecipitation or western analysis of the fusion products. The results confiied that a minimal nuclear targeting signal is located within the first 30 amino acids of polyhedrin. The sequence of basic amino acids (KRKKH) from positions 32 to 36 is not an essential part of this signal. Instead, polyhedrin, which normally is expressed in insect cells, appears to contain a yeast-like nuclear targeting signal. Quantitative analysis of the intracellular dismbution of various fusion products at early or late times of infection revealed that those which contained the nuclear targeting signal were more exclusively nuclear at later times of infection. This was not a nonspecific effect of the viral infection on the nuclear envelope, as cytoplasmic constructs remained smctly cytoplasmic. We hypothesize that this baculovirus encodes or induces a function that enhances nuclear protein localization during the later times of infection.",

A similar hydrophobic region located at the carboxy terminus of the membrane associated polyoma middle T is also able to prevent the nuclear accumulation of a middle T antigen bearing the SV40 T antigen nuclear location signal ( 2 ) . Based on this observation and the results described above, the FS hydrophobic C-terminus may anchor the protein in the cytoplasm. Unable to reach the nucleus, the FS protein could sequester a cytoplasmic factor whose role is to recognize a nuclear location signal and shuttle proteins bearing such a signal to the nucleus. If produced in sufficient quantity, the FS protein could titrate out this factor(s) which is presumably required for heterologous protein transport. To test this model, an analysis of 676FS bearing a polyoma middle T antigen sequence in place of its own hydrophobic sequence is under way. In addition, the kinetics of nuclear NUCLEAR TRRNSPORT, Karen Lister van Zee, Frank Appel, Erika Schreder, Ellen iptake as a function or 67685 and heterologous protein concentration will be tested in microinjection assays.",

A working hypothesis is that a calmodulin-like protein is needed for constitutive transport. This protein would be inhibited by CaM antagonists, and would bind to its target independent of calcium. Ca2+-CaM may act as a competitive inhibitor of transport by binding to the target site in an ineffective manner",

The GPI anchor is covalently linked to the carboxyl-terminus of the protein and appears to be acquired immediately upon completion of protein synthesis. Many GPI anchored proteins, including VSG can be released from the membrane by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). However, some are resistant to this enzyme. Putative PI-PLC sensitive (P2) and resistant (P3) glycolipid precursors to the GPI-anchor have been identified and characterized in T. brucei. P2 and P3 contain ethanolamine-phosphate-Man3GlcN linked glycosidically to the inositol residue, as do all GPI anchors that have been structurally characterized. The single difference between P2 and P3, and the basis of the PI-PLC insusceptibility of P3, is a fatty acid ester linked to the inositol residue in P3. 2-Fluorc~2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-Cilc), a known inhibitor of Dol-P-Man synthesis, has been shown to inhibit the synthesis of R? and P3 in vivo",

How does such a pool of mitochondria1 phospholipid remain distinct from the bulk of phospholipid in the ER or Golgi during lipoprotein assembly? A rat liver membrane fraction with the following properties has been recently isolated. (i) It sediments with mitochondria, not with microsomes. (ii) When separated from mitochondria on a Percoll gradient the membrane contains low marker enzyme activity for ER (NADPH:cytochrome c reductase), mitochondria (cytochrome oxidase) and other organeiles. (iii) The membrane fraction contains most of the enzyme activities of phospholipid biosynthesis that are normally present in the ER, except that the specific activity of PtdSer synthase is twice as high as that in microsomes and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity is absent.

Andryuk, Biotechnology Laboratory, Research and Development Center, EniChem Americas, Inc., Monmouth Junction, NJ 08852. Secretion of proteins from cells occurs by recognition of an amino terminal peptide extension that ultimately results in the translation of the targeted protein directly through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and into the ER lumen. From the ER lumen the protein can either be retained in the lumen or processed further through the Golgi and eventually be secreted or targeted to the vacuole. We are currently examining the parameters that are important in endomembrane targeting of proteins in plant cells. A series of gene fusions have been constructed to study both the requirements of the signal peptide and of the protein being targeted. The proteins being targeted include beta-glucuronidase (GUS), neomycin phophotransferase (NPTII), and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT). We have used site directed mutagenesis to examine the role of glycosylation in the targeting of GUS (two potential glycosylation sites) and CAT (one potential glycosylation site).

We have found that the secD locus codes for two integral. membrane proteins requited for secretion, SecD and &el? The SecD and SecF proteins are similar to one another, both in their primary sequences and in their predicted structure. Pnliminary topological evidence suggests that the SecD protein contains a large (40kD) periplasmic domain, and up to six transmembrane stretches. The SecF protein has a much smaller periplasmic domain, but a similar number of predicted transmembrane stretches. The secE gene codes for a small integral membrane protein which has thrcc transmembrane stretches. Therefore, of the six identified sec genes, four code for integral membrane proteins (secD, secElprlG, secF, and secYlprlA), one codes for a peripheral membrane protein (secAlprlD). and one codes for a cytoplasmic protein which is required for the secretion of only a subset of proteins (secB).

Alan Colman, Les Dale and Glenn Matthews, School o f Biochemistry, Birmingham University Birmingham B15 27T, England V g l i s a glycoprotein with homology to transforming growth factor p which i s encoded on a maternal mRNA localised to the vegetal cortex o f Xenopus oocytes. Despite the regionalisation of the mRNA the protein product diffuses throughout the oocyte, probably within the ER, however it i s not secreted. N-terminal amino acid analysis shows that the signal sequence i s not removed, whilst transfection experiments using COS cells, indicate that the protein i s retained within the ER. In the oocyte most V g l molecules contain 3 mannoserich oligosaccharide side chains, but during early development a 2-chain form becomes the predominant newly-synthesised V g l protein made from the endogenous maternal mRNA. Overproduction o f the protein in the embryo can be effected b y injection o f synthetic mRNA. Under these circumstances the fully glycosylated form predominates.

Shortened \"truncated\" ceramide analogues were added to CHO-cells. The analogues diffuse into cells and serve as precursors forthe in vivo formation of truncated sphingomyelin and truncated glucocerebroside, which are then secreted into the medium. Surprisingly, transport rates from their origin (the Golgi) to the plasma membrane of truncated glucocerebroside and truncated sphingomyelin differed markedly. The glucocerebroside analogue showed a half time of secretion of = 7 min., whereas the shortened sphingomyelin was secreted with a half time of = 15 min.",

Poruchynsky and Paul H. Atkinson, Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, N.Y. 10461. Rotavirus matures by budding into the RER where it is transiently membrane enveloped. W e have developed a scheme for purifying these membrane enveloped biosynthetic intermediates using sucrose gradient fractionation and assay by electron microscopy (EM). Repeated shearing of t h e fractions released both mature non-enveloped particles and the immature membrane-enveloped virus particles (IMPS). When an affinity purified rabbit ~O I~C I O M I antibody directed against the nonstructural rotavirus membrane glycoprotein, NS28, was added t o the sheared fractions followed by the addition of a magnetic matrix coated with sheep anti rabbit IgG (Dynal M450), IMPS and membrane forms were seen t o be specifically bound to the surface of the matrix when viewed by thin section EM and compared with a preimmune serum control. T$viral prote' composition of the isolated IMPS was determined by radiolabeling the infected cells with S-met and % c y s prior t o immuno-isolation and subsequently analyzing t h e solublized IMPS by SDS-PAGE. VPI, VP2, VP4, VP6, VP7 and NS28 were prominently seen. When the cross-linkers, DSP or DTSSP, were applied t o t h e IMPS and the labeled proteins examined in both t h e reduced and non-reduced state, high molecular weight species were seen by SDS-PAGE for the non-reduced samples with the disappearance of bands where NS28, VP7, VP2 and VP4 migrate. Upon reduction, these bands reappeared. These cross-linked unreduced species are being evaluated by sucrose density sedimentation. I t is presently being determined if t h e IMPS contain both the membrane associated and the viral forms of VP7, which are distinguishable with conformation specific antibodies. Isolation of this enveloped viral intermediate lends itself to the in vitro analysis of the energetic and ionic requirements necessary for the uncoating and rearrangement of viral structural and nonstructural proteins.

A variety of e erimental evidence sug ests that gB-1 is involved in the entry of the virus into the cell, possiz by mediating fusion o?the viral envelope to the cellular membrane. However, the re 'on8 of tze protein required for this fusion event have not been identified. We have examined t%e synthesis and processing of gB-1 in Cos-1 cells using a transient expression system. Cos-1 cells transfected with a wild4 e gB-1 gene contain lar e cytoplasmic vacuoles which react with monoclonal antibodies to p g l . Treatment of the ce8s with either monensin or chloroquine prevents the appearance of these vacuoles. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies directed against gB are internalized by cells expressing gB-1, and localize to the cytoplasmic vacuoles. These results suggest that the large vacuoles are derived from fusion of endocytic vesicles containing gB-1. Cos cells transfected with linker insertion mutants that express carboxy-terminal truncated forms of gB-1 (W. Cai, S. Person, C. DebRoy, and B. Gu, 1988 J.Mol.

Vitellogenesis in insects involves the selective uptake of Yolk Proteins (YPs) by the oocyte. The function of the YPs is to provide nutrients during embryo development. Recently, the YPs have been postulated to bind apolar conjugates of ecdysteroids. which may be released during embryogenesis prior to cuticle secretion. One site of YP synthesis is the follicle cells surrounding the oocyte. the other site is the fat body of adult female flies from which the proteins are secreted into the hemolymph. The YPs accumulate in the oocyte via receptor mediated endocytosis. The aim of o u r study is to determine the protein domains of the YPs involved in the interaction with the receptor. To this end a dual strategy was devised. One approach consisted of altering the structure of the YP genes by in vitro mutagenesis and analysing the effects on secretion and uptake in vivo. The second approach involved assaying the YPs of other Dipteran species for their uptake into 2 . melanogaster oocytes with a view to cloning and sequencing the genes of evolutionary distant YPs with conserved uptake function.",

John Sauk, Kathy Norris, Ruth Foster and Martha Somerman, Departments of Pathology and Pharmacology, University of Maryland Dental School, Baltimore, MD 21201. Brefeldin A is an antiviral drug capable of rapidly and reversibly blocking the transport of newly synthesized proteins out of the ER. This change is accompanied by a redistribution of cis/medial Golgi components to the ER. Proteins retained in the ER undergo processing by these recycled &/medial Golgi enzymes, but do not acquire sialic acid, a modification mapped to the trans Golgi system (Lippincott-Schwartz et al.Cell 56: 801, 1989). The characteristics of this drug provide an opportunity to inhibit internal membrane transport to examine the expression of resident ER proteins. colligin/&fl7, a collagen binding membrane glycoprotein believed to function in protein sorting(Nagata et al., 1988), was studied. Osteoligament cells and ROS 17/28 cells were grown in culture and treated with Brefeldin A (Sandoz, Switzerland). Total cellular and secreted protein and collagen were determined after labeling with 'H-Proline (Peterkofsky, 1971). Levels of colligin were ascertained by immunoprecipitation utilizing anti-colligin antibodies (courtesy, K Yam& NZH, NCI). These results show that total protein and collagen secretion is inhibited with intracellular accumulation during Brefeldin A treatment. Accumulation of intracellular proteins was associated with down regulation of the levels of Colligin/Hsp47.

This polypeptide has recently been shown to be required for processing/ presentation of native antigen to T helper cells(Stockinger et al. Cell, 56,683-89, 1989). We have investigated intracellular transport and location of Ii. Ii spans the ER membrane once and exposes its N-terminal on the cytoplasmic side. The assembly of Ii with class II molecules occurs shortly after insertion into the ER membrane. Ii dissociates from the class 11 molecules in a post Golgi compamnent. Preliminary data shows that the invariant chain is found in a post Golgi, mannose-Ckphophate receptor rich compamnent(Lipp et al., unpublished). Ii must therefore contain sorting information which directs it to this location, or be connected with molecules containing this information. To search for a sorting signal on Ii we have made progressive deletions from the N-terminus and expressed the mutated proteins in CVl cells. The intracellular location was studied by microscopy. The Ii mutant lacking 11 aa was found in cytoplasmic vesicles like the native protein, whereas deletion of 15 aa resulted in a surface membrane protein. This indicate that inaacellular sorting information of Ii is located within the cytoplasmic tail and that aa 12-15 is important for sorting.",

In the yeast SaccMmmyces cerevrsiae, the genes yeLl and coding lor GTPbinding proteins have been implicated in protein transport between the endoplasmc reticulum and the Golgi apparatus and between the Gobi apparatus and the plasma membrane respectively. In mammalian cells, a non-hydrolysable analog 01 GTP. G T W . blocks protein transport in vanousmlllllpassays. Recently, several genes (the rabgenes) coding for small GTP-binding proteins have been isolated from a human pheochromocytoma cDNA library. Rabl p shows 75% amino acid identity with Yptt p and may be therelore considered as tls human counterpart. The other proteins share a b u t 40% homology with Yptt and Sec4 proteins (Zaharoui el al.. 1989) . We have produced these proteins in Escherkhta coliand raised polyclonal antibodies against the puraied proteins. The characterization 01 the antibodies against rab1.2.4,5 and 6 proteins is currently underway By mnunobloning, these antibodies recognize a band at the predicted mlecular weght 01 each GTP-bindig protein So far, the antibodies detect a band in all the lysates 01 mammalian cell lines we have screened, suggesting that the rab proteins are ubiquitous. At the steady state. the rab proteins are mostly membrane-bound but a small soluble pool exists lor all 01 them.

Anti-rab 4 antibodies stain filamenteous structures located around the nucleus. By electron mcroscopy. rab 6p is found to be associated with the cyloplasmic face of some Golgi cisternae. The localization of the members 01 the rabfamily indicate that they likely play a role in intracellular transpoll along the secretory pathway Class I1 molecules consist of two integral membrane proteins (a and p chain) and are known to function in the processing and presentation of class I1 restricted antigens. This involves Uanspon from their place of synthesis to an intracellular compartment in which antigen processing occurs. Class II molecules are associated with a third protein, the invariant chain (Ii), for which an important role in the intracellular transport of class I1 molecules has been suggested. We have investigated the intracellular uansport of MHC class I1 antigens (a$) and associated invariant chain (Ii) in a human melanoma cell line. Soon after their synthesis, class I1 molecules and Ii assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum. Pulse-chase studies show that the oligomeric complex (Q,Ii) becomes glycosylated after 1 hour. In contrast to the a and p chain, which remain very stable, Ii is degraded in a time course of 4 hours. This degradation occurs stepwise, f i t to a 2@22 kD molecule, which is then further degraded to a 10 kD peptide. Both degradation products are derived from the N-terminus of Ii, and remain associated with the a and p chain. Our results suggest that, after transport of the oligomeric complex (a$,Ii) to the intracellular compartment, the luminal part (C-terminus) of the Ii is degraded. This compartment is most likely a prelysosome/late endosome, as the Ii colocalises with the mannose-&phosphate receptor in electron microscopy studies. We suggest that the continuous association of Ii or its degradation products with class II molecules may regulate the intracellular transport of class I1MHC molecules to the cell surface. The rotavirus non-structural glycoprotein, NS28, is an RER targeted integralmembrane glycoprotein that is anchored with the carboxy-terminal domain exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Bergmann e t a l , EHBO J s, 1695, 1989) . The protein is uncleaved and the two glycosylation s i t e s a t positions 8 and 18 a r e f i l l e d with high mannose carbohydrate, indicating localisation of the protein to the ER compartment. Rotaviruses assemble i n the lumen of the ER by budding from the ER membrane. The budding event core and NS28 i n which NS28 acts a s the receptor and the major surface protein of the core (VP6) is the ligand. This interaction therefore provides a model for the events involved i n the budding of icosahedral particles across membranes.W e have investigated the topology of NS28 in the membrane and i t s interaction with rotavirus cores. The aim of the work is to characterise and identify the domain(s) of the receptor involved. Engineered variants of NS28 have been delivered to the ER using both ulovirus and vaccinia virus vectors and the receptor a c t i v i t y measured using %-labelled cores. The morphology of the ligand has also been investigated by taking advantage of the observation that VP6 forms two-dimensional paracrystalline arrays that are amenable to study by electron microscopy. The results of t h i s work w i l l be presented together with some preliminary data on the nature of the receptor:ligand complex.is preceded by a specific interaction between the H 41 7 (1988)l. Analyses of organic solvent extracts from labelled membranes resolved a spectrum of partially glycosylated biosynthetic intermediates consistent with a sequential glycosylation pathway for anchor assembly. Using the cell-free system, the source of all three mannose residues in the anchor structure was identified as Dol-P-Man. [3H] Mannose incorporation was stimulated by the addition of Dol-P and reduced in the presence of amphomycin, an inhibitor of Dol-P-Man synthesis, whilst all three mannose residues (identified by methylation analysis) could be labelled by incubating membranes with d~l-P-[~H]mannose.",

The leading edge of a migrating cell is a specialized subcellular compartment composed of a dynamic actin filamentous network and devoid of organelles.This region of the locomoting cell has been shown to be enriched in a variety of actin-binding proteins as well as membrane-associated molecules, although how these molecules come to be concentrated in this region of the cell is not known. I have raised polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to novel actin-binding proteins isolated by F-actin affinity chromatography, and found several that stain the leading edge of migrating chick embryo fibroblasts and the ruffle of the growth cone of PC-12 cells induced to differentiate. One of these antibodies, Mab 2E4, recognizes a protein of 43 kD apparent molecular weight that elutes with ATP from Factin affinity columns loaded with ADP-activated platelet extracts.Furthermore, ATP extraction of permeabilized fibroblasts selectively removes the staining at the leading edge by Mab 2E4 while leaving the actin stress fibers intact. While Mab 2E4 stains both the perinuclear region as well as the leading edge of migrating cells, only perinucleur staining is seen in confluent cultures of fibroblasts and in undifferentiated PC-12 cells.The location of the staining suggests that the antigen is either in or near the Golgi apparatus and centrosomal region of the cell. I am currently investigating whether these organelles play a role in the redistribution of this actin-associated protein during induction of neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells by co-localizing the Mab 2E4 antigen both biochemically and by inununofluorescence with Golgi markers, anti-centrosomal antibodies, clathrin, and p38-containing vesicles, and by observing the effect of microtubule destabilizing drugs on its delivery to the growth cone.",

University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland We have taken a genetic approach to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which specific proteins are imported into the nucleus of the yeast S. cerevisiae. Mutation of the amino-terminal nuclear localization signal of the mating-type regulatory protein a2, product of the MATa2 gene, confers a sterile phenotype. Eighteen mutants in which the nuclear localization signal defect is suppressed were isolated by screening for restoration of mating ability. The suppressor mutations i) are all second-site mutations in a single nuclear gene which we have called SUNl, ii) suppress only those mutations in a2 which affect the amino-terminal localization signal, and iii) are dominant. These properties are consistent with the possibility that SUNl encodes the component of the nuclear import machinery with which the defective localization signal in a2 normally interacts. A SUN1allele has been cloned and is currently being characterized. results were obtained by microinjecting radioactively labelled soluble lamin molecules into the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes. By these means we have demonstrated t h a t a f t e r transport of molecules into the nucleus the cysteine of the highly conserved carboxyterminal tetrapeptide CXXM is in B-type lamins required for a stable association with the nuclear lamina. Moreover, addition of this tetrapeptide to human lamin C , which in our experimental system remains soluble in the nucleoplasm, leads t o a stable association with the nuclear envelope (NE). Deletion of other parts o f lamin molecules indicate that the CXXM domain is insufficient for maintenance of a stable association with the NE b u t that t h i s domain i s required for initiating t h i s process.

            "text": "University, New York, NY 10021. The nuclear import of large proteins is mediated by specific nuclear localization sequences (NLS) within these proteins. The best characterized NLS is the one of SV40 large T antigen. A single mutation in this NLS abolishes nuclear import completely in vivQ and in vitrp. We employed wild type (wt) and mutant (mt) synthetic NLS peptides crosslinked to human serum albumin (peptide conjugates) to test for their binding to proteins of rat liver nuclei on Western Blots. Proteins of 140kd and 55kd were specifically recognized by wt peptide conjugates. The binding to these proteins could be competed for by free wt but not mt peptides. In cell fractionation experiments these proteins were exclusively localized to the nucleus and were extractable from nuclei by either repetitive no salt extractions or high salt extraction. The two proteins may be identical to p140 and p55 identified by photoaffinity labelling with NLS peptides by L. Yamasaki et al. Mol. Cell Biol. 3, 3028 (1989) . Polyclonal antibodies raised against the partially purified proteins excised from polyacrylamide gels recognize both proteins on Western Blots and give a distinct punctate nucleolar staining in immunofluorescence on permeabilized BRL cells. Purified IgG's reactive with p140 do not interfere with nuclear protein import in an a a import assay system. Moreover, fluorescently labeled IgG's are excluded from nuclei in the same system. Further studies will reveal how these specific NLS-binding proteins are involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport or what other function they exhibit. The capacity to raise high titer antisera and monoclonal antibodies to synthetic peptides representing regions of hiologically interesting proteins is a powerful tool in contemporary cell biology. However, raising antibodies to synthetic peptides, which define small portions of a protein of interest, has been tedious at hest. Current technologies which involved coupling a peptide to a carrier protein and immunizing in the presence of adjuvants, such as Freunds, result in the production of antibodies directed primarily to the carrier and the adjuvant with little antibody produced to the peptide of interest. An alternative approach has been developed in our labaratory. In attempting to determine minimal essential components required to construct a well defined immunogenic composite, we have found that when synthetic peptides are provided with a hydrophobic tail through crosslinking to a phospholipid and then assembled into a peptide-phospholipid composite the peptides are immunogenic. An immunogenic mixture is comprised of two essential components: 1. Each composite must contain peptides representing both B-cell determinants and T-helper (Th) determinants presented either contiguously, i.e. part of the same synthetic peptide, or on individual peptides, or trace amounts of a detergent extract of the envelope of Sendai virus to act as a \"generic\" provider of Th-cell determinants cat be included in the composites. 2. To be immunogenic these peptides must be covalently coupled lo phospholipid and inoculated as a peptide-phospholipid conjugate. No other carriers or adjuvants are required to induce an immune response. Since the peptide is the primary antigen in the composite (30-SOug), a substantial portion of the antibody produced following immunization is directed toward the peptide, even when Sendai virus envelope proteins (lug) are included as a \"generic\" provider of T cell help. The antipeptide antibodies produced cross react with the native protein from which the peptide sequences were derived. The technology reported here allows a significant enhancement of antibody production to a normally poorly immunogenic moiety. This enhancement should streamline the purification of proteins. ' ID gain insight into the transport of s t e r o l from l y s o m s to the plasna membrane, we studied the release of lysosomal cholesterol from intact FuYLH r a t hepatana c e l l s to high density lipoprotein (HDL) and other extracellular acceptors of plasna membrane sterol. ' ID i n i t i a t e the labeling of lysosomes, c e l l s were incubated a t lSoC with l o w density l i pprotein (LDL) containing [3Hlcholesteryl oleate ([3H]CD). A t 1S0, LDL was taken up by c e l l s but not delivered to lysosomes, preventing hydrolysis of the [3HlCO. The LDL labeling m e d i u m was removed, cells were rinsed and then warmed to 37% in the presence of an extracellular s t e r o l acceptor. A t 37O, rapid chlorcquine-sensitive hydrolysis of [3H] CO began a f t e r 10-20 min, and rapid efflux of the resulting [3H] cholesterol began aEter 60 min, suggesting a delay of 40-50 min between the generation of cholesterol in lysosomes and the presence of the s t e r o l in t h e plasma membrane. This delay was the same (1) Using multi-copy secretion vectors based on a cryptic plasmid (pKDI) initially isolated from K. drosouhilarum (Chen X.J. et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 14 (1986) 4471-4481) we expressed a cDNA encoding human serum albumin (HSA) under control of natural or hybrid yeast promoters in several species of the yeast Kluvveromvces. High level extracellular secretion of correctly processed HSA could be obtained with several strains of K. lactis. Analysis of the N-terminal sequence of secreted HSA revealed equally efficient removal of the signal sequence, regardless whether a human or a yeast signal was used. Furthermore, the level of HSA secreted to the supernatant was identical with either signal. Detailed physico-chemical characterization of the secreted recombinant HSA (implying isoelectric focusing, native gel electrophoresis, ion-exchange chromatography, reverse-phase chromatography, tryptophan emission spectrometry, thermostability, epitope recognition by monoclonal antibodies, mass spectometry ...I clearly demonstrates that the yeast derived HSA is indistinguishable from natural human HSA. The mitotic stability of albumin expressing pKDl derivatives is species and strain dependent and is modified by promoter strength and culture conditions. Up to 90 % of HSA secreting cells were found to maintain the expression vector after 40 generations of non-selective growth. In addition, pKDl based constructions yielded at least twenty-fold higher extracellular HSA levels then those obtained with isogenic expression cassettes integrated into different loci of the Kluvveromvces genome.",
