Crucial parameters of new diseases can be derived from models, including the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), peak time, peak size, incubation period, infectious period, case-fatality rate (CFR), and elimination time. By definition, R 0 measures the average number of secondary cases that are expected to be generated from a single case of a disease entering a completely susceptible population (5) . R 0 decreases if intervention measures are implemented or the susceptible population size decreases. The controlled reproduction number (R c ) denotes R 0 after interventional measures are undertaken.
