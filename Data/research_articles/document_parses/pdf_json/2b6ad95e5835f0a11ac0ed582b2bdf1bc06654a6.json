Fracking allows extraction companies to recover what is called shale oil 1 from deposits that were inoperable just a few decades ago. In a context of historically low interest rates due to unconventional monetary policies, this advance has encouraged the US and some large foreign banks to invest massively in the shale industry, a sector expected to o er a strong pro tability potential. 2 As a result, the extraction of shale oil in the US has grown dramatically over the last few years and is expected to further increase. Estimates from the US Energy Information Administration suggested that, in 2013, the US produced approximately 3.5 million barrels per day (Mb/d) of shale oil (Ne and Coleman, 2014) , three times higher than the amount produced in 2010. By 2020, the US shale oil production is estimated to reach 4.8 Mb/d, which is approximately one-third of the total US oil supply. Nevertheless, fracking technology has also added new costs to the oil extraction process. Compared to conventional oil, shale oil drilling and extraction are far more labour and capital-intensive, making the process necessarily costlier. 3 Thus, US shale production requires signi cant investments. The funding requirement, coupled with easy access to low-cost debt, has lead shale companies to rely extensively upon borrowing mostly from banks. Loans to oil and gas (O&G hereafter) companies have almost tripled in recent years. Many of these loans were extended to smaller oil companies, in particular, those engaged in shale oil exploration and production. By 2014, the aggregate net debt of O&G companies had already exceeded $175 billion, an approximately 250% increase from its 2005 level (Azar, 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 797, "end": 819, "text": "(Ne and Coleman, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1487, "text": "(O&G hereafter)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1812, "text": "(Azar, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Unsurprisingly, the oil price collapse of 2014-2015 worsened the nancial health of the US shale industry.

While many major US banks have attempted to allay fears of non-performing O&G loans by increasing their reserves, investors worry that conditions could deteriorate even more in the event of an oil market crisis, resulting in a further decline in oil prices. Such fears were recently underscored by two major events. First, the coronavirus pandemic has caused demand for oil to decline so rapidly that the US has seen its oil storage capacity ll up. At the same time, Russia and OPEC ooded the world with oversupply. Consequently, oil prices have collapsed to critical levels, turning the US oil market on its head.

We provide new insights into the dynamic link between oil prices and the US banking system through two main channels. Following a strand of the literature (see for example Narayan and Sharma, 2014 and Broadstock and Filis, 2014) , we emphasise the crucial role that oil prices could play in worsening the nancial health of the banking sector through the deterioration of the creditworthiness of borrowers (here O&G industries).

Indeed, following the dramatic decline in oil prices in 2014, banks with high exposure to O&G extracting industries signi cantly adjusted their balance sheets. They tightened credit supplies to O&G companies and developed other types of loans and asset holdings with a preference for less risky securities. However, the fact that oil prices increased at the beginning of 2016, although remaining below historical levels (under $50 a barrel) and highly volatile, has prompted banks to reopen credit to O&G industries after declining for two years.

Indeed, to date, the national oil companies' nancial resources insulated the oil market from turbulence in the banking system. The shale industry, which is mainly characterised by small, heavily indebted, and independent producers, has introduced a credit channel to the oil market with the following potential consequences. A shock on the volatility of the banks' stock prices has an immediate e ect on the prices of their assets, which become valued below their fundamental value. To address uncertainties around the value of their assets, banks may be forced to urgently restructure their balance sheets to manage spiralling downside liquidity. This process can lead to a considerable decrease in the amount of loans granted and a swift increase in interest rates by banks (Bidder et al., 2019) . This situation will make the funding of future drilling and production during a low oil price environment more challenging, particularly for small and midsize companies due to the capital-intensive nature of shale. The worst-case scenario for US oil producers would be a drop in oil prices, coupled with a gradual increase in interest rates. Consequently, a decline in the US oil production will occur and undoubtedly a ect the total oil production and thus oil prices volatility, since the US is at present one of the largest oil producers.

Two main ndings emerge from the analysis of VIRFs. First, the results are very similar among the four US banks considered. Second, over the rst sub-period, a shock on oil price volatility seems to have a negligible e ect on the volatility of the US banks' stock prices. Conversely, over the second sub-period, oil price volatility signi cantly, although weakly, in uences the volatility of US banks' stock prices. Indeed, following the shock, volatilities of the US banks' returns recede from their expected value (the horizontal line at 0.00) and return after approximately 80 days. Moreover, this e ect is more pronounced in the second sub-period when banks have become more involved in O&G sectors. Turning now to the volatility spillover from the US banking sector to the oil market, it appears that a volatility shock of the US banks' stock prices alters the expected value of oil return volatility in the two sub-periods. In particular, the shock's e ect dissipates more slowly (after 100 days), and in terms of magnitude, the response during the second sub-period is higher than before. In short, the VIRFs' visualisation corroborates the existence of signi cant volatility between oil prices and US banks' stock prices as evidenced by the estimation results. The volatility transmission is especially more important in terms of magnitude since 2010 when banks have become more involved in the shale oil industry.
