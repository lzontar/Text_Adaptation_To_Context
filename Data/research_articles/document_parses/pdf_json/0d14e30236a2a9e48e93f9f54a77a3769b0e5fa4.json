The classification of field submissions as either subgroup 1 or 3 using HRM curve analysis correlated with both S1 gene and 3\u2032UTR nucleotide sequence comparisons. No IB field viruses were classified by HRM curve analysis as being related to the subgroup 2 reference strain N1/88. IB field virus 015 had contrasting nucleotide sequence identity matches for its 3\u2032UTR and S1 gene sequences, and also produced a distinct melt curve profile. Its 3\u2032UTR sequence suggested a close relationship with the subgroup 3 reference strain N1/03, whereas its S1 gene was most similar to the subgroup 2 reference strain N1/88. Strains belonging to subgroup 2 are distinct from strains belonging to subgroup 3. 20 This suggests that IB field virus 015 was a recombination of two viruses from different subgroups. Recombination involving the S1 gene has been extensively documented 11, 13, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and has even been suggested as a basis for the virulence of turkey coronavirus. 23 The nucleotide sequences of the 3\u2032UTR and the S1 gene of the unclassified IB field virus 038b were 99% identical to that of the subgroup 1 reference strain, but this virus generated a distinct conventional melt curve. The 3\u2032UTR nucleotide sequencing revealed that this was because of a 40-bp deletion compared with the sequences for subgroup 1 viruses. Further investigation revealed that this deletion was immediately upstream of the 58-bp deletion that exists in the 3\u2032UTR of all subgroup 1 strains (vaccine and vaccine-related IB virus strains). 24 Thus, the HRM curve analysis was able to differentiate this IB virus when S1 gene sequencing alone would not have detected a difference.
