The inevitability of the influenza virus having an ongoing presence in the human population is due to its ability to mutate and subsequently avoid recognition by the human immune system (Cox and Subbarao, 2000; Osterholm, 2005; Woolnough et al., 2007). 8 In contrast to seasonal influenza epidemics that occur annually, influenza pandemics are rare and unpredictable events, which have occurred irregularly throughout history. Since 1590, there have been between 11 and 14 influenza pandemics with as little as 2 years separating some outbreaks and as many as 56 years between others (Patterson, 1986; Pyle, 1986; Beveridge, 1997; Potter, 1998; Chang et al., 2010) .

This usually causes annual epidemics because people's immunity to the new virus is limited. A process called \"antigenic shift\" refers to the sudden introduction of a new influenza virus subtype to the environment, which has the potential to cause pandemics as the human population will generally have no protection against the new virus subtype. This can occur when an existing influenza virus infecting an animal becomes capable of directly infecting a human or when the formation of a new virus occurs through mixing of genetic material from animal and human influenza viruses, which is known as genetic reassortment .

They act as a form of collateralized stop-loss reinsurance, 27 which essentially eliminates the credit risk exposure for sponsors (Bagus, 2007) . Compared to 1-year coverage usually provided by stop-loss reinsurance, they allow the sponsor to secure fixed cost multiyear coverage, typically ranging from 3 to 5 years, which in turn allows sponsors to spread the fixed cost of issuance over several years (Cummins, 2008) . Furthermore, these bonds have the flexibility to access 24 The mortality index is measured over a 2-calendar-year period in order to mitigate the chance that an influenza pandemic will be cut off by the end of a measurement period. 25 The risk period is the time period over which the catastrophic mortality bond provides coverage. 26 An indemnity-based payoff trigger is not used because investors would expect to receive a significant premium for moral hazard and adverse selection depending on the type of business covered, risk modeling credibility, and the market's confidence in the sponsor's risk management procedures; investors would want to undertake more extensive due diligence of the sponsor and the securitized portfolio to better understand the insurance risk they are undertaking; and sponsors will be reluctant to disclose data on insurance portfolios since they could be of proprietary nature and their disclosure valuable to competitors (Hartwig et al., 2008; Rooney, 2008) . 27 Stop-loss reinsurance is a form of excess of loss reinsurance under which the reinsurer's liability commences when the aggregate claims experience on the reinsured portfolio during a specified time period exceeds a predetermined level (IAAust, 2009). capital markets when required by using shelf programs. 28 This has the potential to avoid market disruptions caused by reinsurance prices and availability cycles (Cummins and Trainar, 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 268, "end": 281, "text": "(Bagus, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 542, "end": 557, "text": "(Cummins, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 616, "end": 618, "text": "24", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 792, "end": 794, "text": "25", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1538, "text": "(Hartwig et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1552, "text": "Rooney, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1971, "end": 1997, "text": "(Cummins and Trainar, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Advantages and Disadvantages"}, {"text": "On the other hand, several disadvantages arise with catastrophic mortality bonds.

Second, the issue of basis risk exists for catastrophic mortality bonds since the payoff trigger is index based and the actual loss suffered is unlikely to be perfectly matched by the bond payoff. This contrasts with traditional reinsurance, which has no basis risk since it is indemnity based and provides full coverage for reinsured losses (Hartwig et al., 2008) . Third, the capital credit given by regulators and rating agencies may be reduced for catastrophic mortality bonds in comparison to traditional reinsurance (Standard & Poor's, 2008) .
