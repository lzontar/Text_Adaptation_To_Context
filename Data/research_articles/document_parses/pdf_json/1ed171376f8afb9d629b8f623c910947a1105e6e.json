The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19 relies on microbiological tests but these tests might not be available in an emergency setting and their results are not immediately available, contrary to CT. In addition to its role for early diagnosis, CT has a prognostic role by allowing visually evaluating the extent of COVID-19 lung abnormalities 4, 5 . The objective of this study is to address prediction of short-term outcomes, especially need for mechanical ventilation. In this multi-centric study, we propose an end-to-end artificial intelligence solution for automatic quantification and prognosis assessment by combining automatic CT delineation of lung disease meeting expert's performance and data-driven identification of biomarkers for its prognosis. AI-driven combination of variables with CT-based biomarkers offers perspectives for optimal patient management given the shortage of intensive care beds and ventilators 6, 7 .",

Disease extent is the only parameter that can be visually estimated on chest CT to quantify disease severity 4, 5 , but visual quantification is difficult and usually coarse. Several AI-based tools have been recently developed to quantify interstitial lung diseases (ILD) [20] [21] [22] [23] , which share common CT features with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially a predominance of ground glass opacities. In this study, we investigated a fully automatic method ( Figure 1 ) for disease quantification, staging and short-term prognosis. The approach relied on (i) a disease quantification solution that exploited 2D & 3D convolutional neural networks using an ensemble method, (ii) a biomarker discovery approach sought to determine the share space of features that are the most informative for staging & prognosis, & (iii) an ensemble robust supervised classification method to distinguish patients with severe vs non-severe short-term outcome and among severe patients those intubated and those who did not survive.",

Disease and lung were delineated on all 23, 423 images used as training dataset, and on only 20 images per exam but by 2 independent annotators in the test dataset (2, 600 images). The overall annotation effort took approximately 800 hours and involved 15 radiologists with 1 to 7 years of experience in chest imaging. The consensus between manual (2 annotators) and automated segmentation was measured using the Dice similarity score (DSC) 26 and the Haussdorf distance (HD). The CovidENet performed equally well to trained radiologists in terms of DSCs and better in terms HD ( Figure 2 ). The mean/median DSCs between the two expert's annotations on the test dataset were 0.70/0.72 for disease segmentation. For the same task, DSCs between CovidENet and the manual segmentations were 0.69/0.71 and 0.70/0.73. In terms of HDs, the observed average value between the two experts was 9.16mm while it was 8.96mm between CovidENet and the two experts. When looking at disease extent, defined as the percentage of lung affected by the disease, we found no significant difference between automated segmentation and the average of the two manual segmentations ( ",

We reviewed outcomes in patient charts within the 4 days following chest CT and divided the patients in 3 groups: those who didn't survive, those who required mechanical ventilation and those who were still alive and not intubated. Out of the 478 included patients, 27 died (6%) and 83 were intubated (17%), forming a group of 110 patients with severe short-term outcome (23%). Data of 383 patients from 3 centers were used for training and those of 85 patients from 3 other centers composed an independent test dataset (Table 3) . Radiomics-based prognosis gained significant attention in the recent years towards predicting treatment outcomes 27 . In this study we have adopted a similar strategy, we extracted 107 features related to first order, higher order statistics, texture and shape information for lungs, disease extent and heart. Feature selection was performed on a basis of predictive value consensus. We created several representative partitions 117 of the training set (80% training and 20% validation) and run 13 different supervised classification methods towards optimal separation of the observed clinical ground truth between severe and non-severe cases ( Table 4 ). The features that were shared between the different classifiers were retained as robust imaging biomarkers using a cut-off probability of 0.25 and were aggregated to patients' age and gender (Table 5 ). In total 12 features were retained for the prognosis part and included age, gender, disease extent, descriptors of disease heterogeneity and extension, features of healthy lung and a descriptor of cardiac heterogeneity. Correlations for some these features and the clinical outcome are presented in Figure 5 while a representation of these feature space with respect to the different classes is presented in Figure 3 .",

The staging component sought to separate patients with severe and non-severe short-term outcomes, while the prognosis sought to predict the risk of decease among severe patients. On the basis of the feature selection step, the machine learning algorithms that had a balanced accuracy greater than 60% on validation were considered. The selection of these methods was done on the basis of minimum discrepancy between performance on training and internal validation sub-training data set. We have built two sequential classifiers using this ensemble method, one to determine the severe cases and a second to predict survival. The classifier aiming to separate patients with severe and non-severe short-term outcomes had a balanced accuracy of 74%, a weighted precision of 79%, a weighted sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 79% to predict a severe short-term outcome ( Figure 4 , Table 6 ). The performance of the second classifier aiming to differentiate between intubated and deceased patients was even higher with a balanced accuracy of 81% ( Figure 4 , Table 7 ). The hierarchical classifiers combing the 3 classes had a balanced accuracy of 68%, a weighted precision of 79%, a weighted sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 83% ( Figure 4) .

This could be of great help in the current context of the pandemic with healthcare resources under extreme pressure. In a context where the sensitivity of RT-PCR has been shown to be low, such as 63% when perform on nasal swab 28 , chest CT has been shown to provide higher sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 as compared with initial RT-PCR from pharyngeal swab samples 10 . The current COVID-19 pandemic requires implementation of rapid clinical triage in healthcare facilities to categorize patients into different urgency categories 29 , often occurring in the context of limited access to biological tests. Beyond the diagnostic value of CT for COVID-19, our study suggests that AI should be part of the triage process. The developed tool will be made publicly available. Our prognosis and staging method achieved state of the art results through the deployment of a highly robust ensemble classification strategy with automatic feature selection of imaging biomarkers and patients' characteristics available within the image' metadata. In terms of future work, the continuous enrichment of the data base with new examples is a necessary action on top of updating the outcome of patients included in the study. The integration of non-imaging data and other related clinical and categorical variables such as lymphopenia, the D-dimer level and other comorbidities 9, 30-32 is a necessity towards better understanding the disease and predicting the outcomes. This is clearly demonstrated from the inability of any of the state-of-the art classification methods (including neural networks and multi-layer perceptron models) to predict the outcome with a balanced accuracy greater to 80% on the training data. Our findings could have a strong impact in terms of (i) patient stratification with respect to the different therapeutic strategies, (ii) accelerated drug development through rapid, reproducible and quantified assessment of treatment response through the different mid/end-points of the trial, and (iii) continuous monitoring of patient's response to treatment.",

A major advantage of the AtlasNet framework is that it incorporates a natural data augmentation by registering each CT scan to several templates.

The network included 5 convolutional blocks, each one containing two Conv-BN-ReLU layer successions. Maxpooling layers were also distributed at the end of each convolutional block for the encoding part. Transposed convolutions were used on the decoding part to restore the spatial resolution of the slices together with the same successions of layers. For the 3D pipeline, the model similarly consisted of five blocks with a down-sampling operation applied every two consequent Conv3D-BN-ReLU layers. Additionally, five decoding blocks were utilized for the decoding path, at each block a transpose convolution was performed in order to up-sample the input. Skip connections were also employed between the encoding and decoding paths. In order to train this model, cubic patches of size 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64 were randomly extracted within a close range of the ground truth annotation border in a random fashion. Corresponding cubic patches were also extracted from the ground truth annotation masks and the lung anatomy segmentation masks. To this end, we trained the model with the CT scan patch as input, the annotation patch as target and the lung anatomy annotation patch as a mask for calculating the loss function only within the lung region.

ART-Plan is a CE-marked solution for automatic annotation of organs, harnessing a combination of anatomically preserving and deep learning concepts. This software has been trained using a combination of a transformation and an image loss. The transformation loss penalizes the normalized error between the prediction of the network and the affine registration parameters depicting the registration between the source volume and the whole body scanned. These parameters are determined automatically using a downhill simplex optimization approach. The second loss function of the network involved an image similarity function -the zero-normalized cross correlation loss -that seeks to create an optimal visual correspondence between the observed CT values of the source volume and the corresponding ones at the full body CT reference volume. This network was trained using as input a combination of 360, 000 pairs of CT scans of all anatomies and full body CT scans. These projections used to determine the organs being present on the test volume. Using the transformation between the test volume and the full body CT, we were able to determine a surrounding patch for each organ being present in the volume. These patches were used to train the deep learning model for each full body CT. The next step consisted of creating multiple annotations on the different reference spaces, and for that a 3D fully convolutional architecture was trained for every reference anatomy. This architecture takes as input the annotations for each organ once mapped to the reference anatomy and then seeks to determine for each anatomy a network that can optimally segment the organ of interest similar to the AtlasNet framework used for the disease segmentation. This information was applied for every organ of interest presented in the input CT Scan. In average, 6, 600 samples were used for training per organ after data augmentation. These networks were trained using a conventional dice loss. The final organ segmentation was achieved through a winner takes all approach over an ensemble networks approach. For each organ, and for each full body reference CT a specific network was built, and the segmentation masks generated for each network were mapped back to the original space. The consensus of the recommendations of the different subnetworks was used to determine the optimal label at the voxel level.",

Then, another majority voting was applied on the cases predicted as severe only to classify them into intubated or deceased (Table 7 ). In such a setup, the correlation of the reported features are summarized in Table 5 . For the hierarchical prognosis on the three classes a voting classifier for the prediction of each class against the others has been applied to aggregate the predicted outcomes from the 7 selected methods. In the Figure 8 we visualize the distributions of the different features along the ground truth labels and the prediction of the hierarchical classifier for each subject. In particular, all the samples are grouped using their ground truth labels and a boxplot is generated for each group and each feature. Additionally, color coded points are over imposed at each boxplot denoting the prediction label. It is therefore clearly visible that some features such as the disease extent, the age, the shape of the disease and the uniformity seems to be very important on separating the different subjects. ",

The DSC between manual segmentations served as reference to evaluate the similarity between the automated and the two manual segmentations. Moreover, the Hausdorff distance was also calculated to evaluate the quality of the automated segmentations in a similar manner. Disease extent was calculated by dividing the volume of diseased lung by the lung volume and expressed in percentage of the total lung volume. Disease extent measurement between manual segmentations and between automated and manual segmentations were compared using paired Student's t-tests. For the stratification of the dataset into the different categories, classic machine learning metrics, namely balanced accuracy, weighted precision, and weighted specificity and sensitivity were used.
