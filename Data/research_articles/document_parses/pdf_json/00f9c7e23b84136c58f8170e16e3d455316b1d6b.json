COVID-19 spreads easily from person to person (7) (8) (9) . Hospitals should screen patients with suspected COVID-19 in order to keep infected patients strictly isolated from noninfected patients and healthcare workers. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is currently the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. However, RT-PCR is suboptimal for rapid triaging: it takes several hours before results become available and sensitivity of the test may be insufficient to reliably exclude COVID-19 (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Accordingly, RT-PCR testing should be repeated in patients with a negative initial result and persistent clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Chest CT may be an attractive alternative or adjunct to RT-PCR testing, because it can be performed rapidly. A study among more than 1000 Chinese patients reported that chest computed tomography (CT) has a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and that it may currently be considered as a primary tool for COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas (15) . The promising results of Ai et al.'s study (15) and the clinical need for a fast screening tool have led to the introduction of chest CT for patients with suspected COVID-19 in our hospital mid-March 2020. From initial experience, we have learned that the interpretation of chest CT in patients with suspected in frontline clinical practice is not always straightforward. This can be attributed to the relative lack of experience in interpreting chest CT in suspected COVID- 19 (16) However, this proposed system has not been evaluated yet, to our knowledge.

Interestingly, the proportion of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases was lower in the \"atypical appearance\" category (2.8% to 5.3%) than in the \"negative for pneumonia\" category (20% to 25%). This can be explained by the facts that this study included symptomatic patients (i.e. fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) and that the \"atypical appearance\" category also included abnormalities consistent with another lung disease (not COVID-19). Therefore, the prevalence of diseases other than COVID-19 (e.g., bacterial lobar pneumonia, bronchial and bronchiolar infections, and typical cardiogenic pulmonary edema) was considerably higher in the \"atypical appearance\" category than in the \"negative for pneumonia\" category, whereas the opposite was true for the prevalence of COVID-19 between these two categories.

Third, the prevalence of COVID-19 was relatively high (47%) in our study population. The proportion of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases in each of the categories may be different in areas with different COVID-19 prevalence. Fourth, there was a wide variation in duration of symptoms before chest CT (median of 7 days [range 2-21 days]), whereas it is known that chest CT appearance of COVID-19 can dramatically change over time (28) . However, this variation reflects clinical practice, as some I n p r e s s patients present earlier in the course of the disease while other patients present later in the course of the disease.

The American College of Radiology recommends that chest CT should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19(26).
