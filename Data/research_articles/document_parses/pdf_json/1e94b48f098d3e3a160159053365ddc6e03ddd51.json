To enable the application of PCR in resource-poor or non-specialist laboratories, we have developed and evaluated a nested PCR method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using simple agarose gel electrophoresis for product detection. Using clinical samples tested by conventional qPCR methods and RNA transcripts of defined RNA copy number, the nested PCR based on the RdRP gene demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in clinical samples, but showed variable and transcript lengthdependent sensitivity for RNA transcripts. Samples and transcripts were further evaluated in an additional N protein real-time quantitative PCR assay. As determined by 50% endpoint detection, the sensitivities of three RT-qPCRs and nested PCR methods varied substantially depending on the transcript target with no method approaching single copy detection.

One possible 176 factor limiting the sensitivity of PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 may originate from the highly 177 structured nature of the genome as measured by standard thermodynamic RNA structure 178 prediction methods. 28 SARS-CoV-2, as well as other coronaviruses, has extensive RNA 179 secondary structure elements peppered throughout its genome -approximately 62% -67% of 180 bases may be involved in base pairing. It is conceivable that, if a section of the target sequence 181 is embedded within highly energetically favoured RNA secondary structure, binding of the PCR 182 oligonucleotides could be competitively inhibited, delaying the initiation of the PCR reaction. This 183 effect could explain the unusual findings that no PCR based assay for SARS-CoV-2, whether in 184 this study or others, have been able to achieve single copy detection sensitivities.

Strikingly, the nested 130 PCR was not able to detect RNA control 1 with any appreciable regularity even at the highest 131 copy number tested despite robust detection of RNA control 2establishes the first published nested PCR method for the sensitive detection of SARS-136 CoV-2 in RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swab samples. The nested PCR showed highly 137 concordant results with RT-qPCR performed at a hospital diagnostic laboratory, with a sensitivity 138 of 94.2%, specificity of 100%, and overall agreement of 95.3%. The use of nested PCR is a 139 practical alternative for laboratories without real-time PCR systems, but does require an RNA 140 extraction step. Whilst there has been a global shortage of necessary reagents, 19 an increasing 141 number of novel extractions methods have been described in the literature. 20-23 Furthermore, 142 nested PCR is also less amenable to automation and requires equipment for casting agarose gels 143 and amplicon visualization using UV light. The poor performance of the nested PCR for detecting 144 RNA control 1 is hypothesized to be due to the design of the transcript standard. Twist Bioscience 145 synthetic SARS-CoV-2 transcripts are six, non-overlapping 5 kb fragments. The drastically low 146 sensitivity but presence of PCR products of the correct length strongly suggests that the 147 fragmentation process separates the nF1 and nF2, nR1, and nR2 binding locations onto two 148 different fragments. This result underscores the notion that not all transcript standards are equal 149 for different PCR-based detection modalities. 150 Secondarily, this study demonstrates inconsistent sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 targets for different 151 PCR-based detection modalities. The results of this study point to remarkably different 152 performances between the three PCR methods analyzed for different SARS-CoV-2 RNA 153 transcripts. This inconsistently between different RT-qPCR methods has been noted by other 154 authors.

Lastly, Kudo et al. designed a multiplex RT-qPCR using 168 the CDC N1, N2, and RNAse P primer and probe sets. 27 Using a full-length control and 169 reanalyzing the raw data using the Reed-Muench method, the multiple RT-qPCR demonstrated 170 a 50EP of 30.0 copies/reaction for the CDC N1 primers and 107.7 copies/reaction for the CDC 171 N2 primers. 172 These results are compatible with anecdotal evidence from several labs in the United Kingdom 173 and elsewhere that consistent low level detection is unreliable and aberrant results are common. 174", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "185Understanding the association between viral load and disease progression is important for the 186 selection of therapies. Tom et al.29 recently proposed reporting RT-qPCR Ct values rather than 187 binary PCR test results within clinical reports as a means of estimating the viral load of patients 188 due to the inverse correlation of Ct value with copy number. While informative when tracking the 189 progression of Ct values for a single patient over time or comparing to other patients within the 190 same diagnostic pipeline, the results of this study do not support making direct comparisons 191 between data gained from different laboratories as Ct values are not readily comparable. For 192 these values to be informative, Ct values published in the literature should contain the methods 193 used as well as estimates of in-house correlation with copy. Alternatively, as also recommend by 194 Tom et al., reports could provide the Ct value as binned within ranges also seen in the laboratory 195 (i.e. in the top quartile of Ct values seen in this laboratory). 196 This current study is limited in that the standardized thermal cycler temperatures and 197 concentrations of Mg 2+ recommended by the Quantitech RT-PCR kit were used for both the 198 Charit\u00e9-RdRP and CDC N1 primers. It is feasible that slight alterations to the annealing 199 temperature and salt concentration could result in marginal increases in sensitivity, but these 200 changes would have to be assessed and calibrated on a lab by lab basis and may have different 201 values depending on the RT-qPCR master mix and PCR system used. acknowledge the staff of the Microbiology Department of the John Radcliffe Hospital 206 for their work in processing and testing clinical samples.
