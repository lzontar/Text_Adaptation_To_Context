Clinicians are fighting against this new disease and are focusing on various factors that may lead to better survival outcomes. The common symptoms of COVID -19 infection are fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue [5] [6] [7] [8] . In a study by Guan et al [5] there was analysis of patients with COVID-19 in China and had described various clinical characteristics and their association with the severity of disease. Previous coexisting illness was seen in severe disease group in 39 % patients as compared to 21 % patients in non severe disease group [5] . The treatment of corona virus infection with underlying comorbidity could increase severity of disease and may be associated with high risk of ventilator support and ICU care [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Emami et al [23] had performed a metaanalysis and described the prevalence of various comorbidity associated with hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The limitation of the study by Emami et al [23] was that this study had only description on prevalence of associated comorbidity in corona infection and lacked results on effect of comorbidities on severity of disease and treatment outcomes. [23] The medical facilities in all countries including developed and developing nations are highly strained and exhausted in the care of COVID-19. In published literature on COVID-19 there are limited guidelines on management of associated medical comorbidities [24, 25] . So there is a need to formulate a treatment strategy for various major medical comorbidities. This may be helpful for clinicians to identify high risk patients during admission process at COVID centre. Currently the number of patients in this pandemic on rise and a better understanding of high risk comorbidities may be helpful the physicians. The patients with comorbidities can be given safety guidelines to avoid visiting infected zones and contact with possible infected person.",

Some records were also retrieved via cross-references from published papers. There were no restrictions on the date of publication and the language of articles published. After eliminating duplicates, two investigators (AAS and KN) independently reviewed all abstracts: the full texts of articles regarded as potentially eligible for consideration were extracted for further analysis. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles by hand to identify further articles for analysis. Thereafter, eligible articles were selected for final analysis according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements between the authors were resolved by consensus. We included only human studies and articles with clearly defined clinical outcome measures. The exclusion criteria included animal studies; absence of a comparison group; absence or unclear reporting of clinical outcome measures; isolated case reports or case series with sample size < 5. Articles selected for the final analysis were independently graded using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for the Assessment of the Quality of Nonrandomized Studies in Meta-analyses",
