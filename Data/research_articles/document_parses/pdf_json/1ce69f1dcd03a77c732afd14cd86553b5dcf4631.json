Occurrences of these different COVID-19 clinical symptoms between 32 countries might be due to virus mutations, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) 33 polymorphisms and others. 1 In this paper, we will focus on the potential virus mutation 34 hypothesis through the GISAID database 4 (https://www.gisaid.org). 35",

The first mutation, D614G in the S protein (found in 2342 samples), 42 determining the virus clade 'G', frequently co-evolves with the P323L mutation in the nsp12 43 protein (found in 2318 samples). Indeed, in Spain, France, Italy and Switzerland, both 44 mutations are reported, respectively, in 42 sequences out of 145 available; 173 times out of 45 205 sequences; 30 times out of 44 sequences; and 47 times out of 48 sequences. In Belgium: 46 251 D614G and 231 P323L variants are found out of 342 sequences. 47 The ORF8-L84S (third most frequent mutation), that determines the virus clade 'S', appeared 48 in 740 sequences but is only reported in 71 European cases including 44 samples from Spain 49 (collected from 1 to 12 March 2020). The remaining 27 sequences were reported in Iceland (12 including 11 persons who traveled from USA), United Kingdom (UK) is not reported in Italy and Switzerland, nor in other European countries. In 53 addition, we show that L84S amino acid substitution is co-evolving with 3 other mutations: 54 nsp4-F308Y, ORF3a-G196V & N-S197L. These mutations are less reported, only 60/61 55 times. In Spain, 37 sequences showed these 4 combined mutations. In other European 56 countries, all these mutations are also found in the above-mentioned samples from: are also retrieved in 7 Australian patients, in 4 Chile patients who 59 traveled from Europe, in 1 Brazilian patient (returning from Madrid, reported as family 60 cluster), in 1 US, 1 Senegal and 1 Georgian patient. Moreover, in 1 of the UK patients and in 61 all 7 Australian patients, in addition to the S197L mutation, the N protein presents the P13L 62 replacement. 63 The 4 th frequent mutation (ORF3a-Q57H found in 734 sequences) is reported in 101 France 64 and 32 Belgium samples but neither in Italy nor in Spain samples. 65 Both the 5 th and 6 th mutations (N-R203K & N-G204R) are found in 4 Spanish, 10 Italian, 10 66 Belgium and 6 France samples. 67 Both the 7 th and 8 th mutations (nsp6-L37F & ORF3a-G251V, the latest corresponding to the 68 'V' clade extensively associated with UK patient sequences) are found in 5 Spain and 2 Italy 69 samples; and each are respectively found in 11 and 18 Belgian and 6 and 7 French patient 70 sequences. 71 At least three specific mutations were only reported in Belgium patients: nsp10-Y126* (51 72 samples), S-S943P (22 samples) and N-F171C (4 samples). In addition, the nsp3-A534V 73 variant is only reported in 11 Belgium and 10 Luxembourg samples. 74 All the above-mentioned mutations are positioned on the SARS-CoV-2 genome in Figure 1. Discussion 76 Even though our sequence analysis is not exhaustive, it points out an association of diverse 77 mutations, including co-evolving ones, in specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins with specific 78 countries. All the above discussed mutations (except the N-R203K) present modifications in 79 their physicochemical properties (hydropathy, volume, chemical, charge, hydrogen 80 acceptor/donor atoms or polarity classes). Particularly, the L84S substitution in the ORF8 81 protein, which is mainly found in Spain for European countries, is the one showing the most 82 physicochemical changes. These mutations could therefore affect the function of the 83 corresponding proteins: the non-structural (nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, ORF3a, ORF8) as well as the 84 spike S protein, and the nucleocapsid N protein. It was reported that S, ORF8 and ORF3a 85 proteins are significantly different from other known SARS-like coronaviruses and could be 86 linked to changes in pathogenicity/transmission. 6 A recent study proposed that these proteins 87 are involved in the inhibition of the heme anabolic pathway and could be linked to a wide 88 range of infections and diseases. 7 Moreover, the S Clade mutation in ORF8 is frequently 89 associated with mutations in ORF3a, nsp4 and the N protein.
