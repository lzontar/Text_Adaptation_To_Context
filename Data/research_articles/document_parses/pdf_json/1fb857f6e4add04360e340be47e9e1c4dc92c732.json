However, nonverbal communication is just as important as the words we use. 1 In times of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of face masks has become ubiquitous in many countries. 2 Many facial expressions are the same across cultures, like happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, and our faces can express emotions without saying a word. Given widespread masking, this nonverbal communication has become increasingly difficult.",

People with dementia are usually able to interpret facial signals correctly: they interpret a smile as a sign of joy and compressed lips as a sign of anger. They can tell from the sound of our voice, our posture, and our speed whether we are relaxed or stressed, in a good mood or angry. A lot of this is missing right now-and many of us do not even realize it! Physicians and nurses who are more sensitive to nonverbal cues reinforce the perception of sincerity, dedication, and competence, which, in turn, improves measures around utilization of health services, functional status, and the overall provider-patient relationship. 6 Nonverbal communication is a unique opportunity to connect. Therefore, it is important that we take intentional control of our nonverbal communication in this time of social distancing and masked faces.",

Once we become more aware of our characteristic gestures and body language, we can then go about aligning our nonverbal signaling with our spoken message. If we do not practice the habit of underlining everything we say with gestures and pantomime, the message we convey might be harder to interpret.",

By approaching them from the front, you will give older people a chance to process who you are and what you are asking. Respect the person's personal space but make sure to drop down to eye level; this will allow the individual to feel more comfortable and in control of the situation. Since a person with dementia will be able to detect your body language, sudden movements can cause distress on the person and can make it hard to communicate. Therefore, project a positive, calm attitude and avoid body language that shows frustration, anger, or impatience, while trying not to interrupt them and give them your full attention.",

Use short, simple sentences and underline your words with gestures. Make your statement or ask your question and then pause. Keep your voice even, tone gentle, and speech slow. Speak louder, if needed, because the lip-reading cues that many with hearing disabilities use to compensate will be absent. Sometimes, it might be helpful subtly matching the gestures and tone of the older adult to help them feel understood. Observe first, then try mirroring the person's mood or tone, or using a quieter approach.",
