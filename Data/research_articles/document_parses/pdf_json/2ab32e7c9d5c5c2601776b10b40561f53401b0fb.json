Coronavirus has also caused many problems in hospitals, where these are no longer able to accommodate a large number of patients. This virus has also begun to spread between medical and paramedical teams, and this causes a major risk to the health of patients staying in hospitals. To reduce the spread of the virus and maintain the health of patients who need a hospital stay, home hospitalization is one of the best possible solutions. This paper proposes a home hospitalization system based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Fog computing, and Cloud computing, which are among the most important technologies that have contributed to the development of the healthcare sector in a significant way. These systems allow patients to recover and receive treatment in their homes and among their families, where patient health and the hospitalization room environmental state are monitored, to enable doctors to follow the hospitalization process and make recommendations to patients and their supervisors, through monitoring units and mobile applications developed for this purpose. The results of evaluation have shown great acceptance of this system by patients and doctors alike.",

People can become infected with COVID-19 disease by other people who have the virus, as this virus spreads by direct contact. It may spread through respiratory droplets when the person coughs or sneezes. It may also spread if a person touches a surface on which the virus is present and then touches his mouth, nose, or eyes [1] . This virus poses a major risk, especially for the elderly and people with chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes [2] . As a result of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, most hospitals around the world are experiencing problems to tolerate a large number of infected people, as this virus has started to spread among the medical and paramedical teams of these hospitals, and this can cause a great risk to the health of patients staying in hospitals. In addition to the spread of this virus, the world is also witnessing a significant increase in the number of elderly people. Where according to the World Aging and Health Report 2015 of the World Health Organization, the number of people aged 60 and over will increase from 900 million to about 2 billion between 2015 and 2050. This significant increase in the number of elderly people increases patient dependency, chronic diseases, and disability [3] in addition to the large financial burdens that will be incurred by the economies of the countries concerned, as spending on hospital accommodation will increase [4] .",

This hospitalization aims to alleviate the burden of the disease in two ways, one of which is medical and human, given that receiving treatment in the family environment is of great importance and positively affects the benefit of medicines. The second aspect is the economic aspect, especially since the cost at hospitals has witnessed a significant increase, whereas home hospitalization greatly reduces the cost of health care.",

The IoT has been relied upon in many applications and its use has seen wide acceptance in almost all fields, including the field of health care, where it is extensively applied in monitoring patient health remotely [12, 13] , and its different technology provides a solid approach to improving safety, health, and the wellbeing of humanity [14, 15] . Cloud computing in recent years has provided many of the resources that are supported to take advantage of the IoT in terms of processing, ubiquitous computation and storage, and to share these resources in easy and simple ways [16] . Many Cloud and IoT-based solutions have been suggested in the literature [17, 18] , which add to the many benefits of Cloud computing to support ever-increasing data volumes. However, moving to the IoT cannot be considered a simple application of Cloud computing. Recently, a new concept of computing has emerged that is attracting much attention as compared to Cloud computing, because of its ability to meet requirements that have not yet been addressed through Cloud computing; it is termed Fog computing [19] . Fog computing extends the computing resources of the Cloud to the network edge of the IoT, allowing many connected devices to offer services such as storing and processing data to their users. Its structure also provides support for real-time data analysis for all geographically distributed devices with limited capacity for data storage and processing, thereby reducing the amount of data exchanged between devices and the Cloud [20] .",

At [24] for example, an IoT-based smart healthcare system is designed that collects patient information from different sensors and allows a doctor to monitor patient physiological parameters remotely, and diagnose diseases quickly, and also provides alerts to both the guardian and the doctor by sending SMS or emails in a timely manner. In Refs. [25] an e-health system for elderly's health monitoring based on IoT and Fog computing was proposed, where this system periodically collected physiological and public health parameters of the elderly using the Mysignals HW V2 platform and an Android application that plays the role of Fog server and enables the elderly and their families to monitor their health and communicate with health care providers. An IoT-based application has been proposed that explains the benefits of the concept of Fog computing [26] . This application aims to provide reliable, accurate, and immediate heart rate monitoring via embedded wearable devices, mobile edge devices, and Cloud services. In recent years, the use of smartphones and tablets has increased in health monitoring applications, where they are used as mobile computing devices and as Fog servers that process data and send it to the Cloud [27] [28] [29] [30] . A mobile application was used at [31] to monitor the patient's heart in real time as an application through the pulse rate sensor, which measures the patient's pulse and then sends it to storage in a remote database. This application also sends notifications to the doctor if a problem is discovered in the heartbeat. A mobile application was also used to develop a system for monitoring vital signs at work [32] .",

Likewise, MongoDB considers Schema-less as it does not adhere to a specific schema, so the content of files may vary from time to time. MongoDB is also considered a scalable system as it can cope with thousands of requests simultaneously without affecting the speed of performance [45] . As in MySQL, which consists of tables, MongoDB is also composed of collections, which in turn contain documents, so that the size of the collection depends on the number of documents contained within it. We can say that one of the most important differences between MongoDB and MySQL is that the file structure does not adhere to certain rules, as we find that the rows' components are the same in one table. They must be subject to the schema rules that have been defined as MongoDB does not support any scheme and therefore the file structure can change from time to time within the same collection [46] .",

In the previous subsection, we presented the nurses' Android application that allows them to measure the patients' vital signs and prepare the medical reports. In this subsection, we will present the Android applications for the doctors, the patients and their relatives, and the system administrators. React Native has been used to develop the various applications of this system It is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook that is used to develop Android and iOS applications using ReactJS, and it allows developers to use all the native functionality of these platforms [52] . Fig. 8 illustrates some Android application interfaces for the doctors, where after logging in, each doctor can view the profiles of patients and follow the environmental condition of the hospitalization rooms ( Fig. 8  (a) ), and the health status of patients by viewing the measurements and medical report for each patient (Fig. 8(b) ). Through this Android application, the doctor also manages each patient's medications, determining the time to take each type of medicine, in addition to providing recommendations to patients and their relatives to ensure a good hospitalization process. This Android application also provides notifications to the doctors when adding any medical report for one of the patients or when the environmental condition of any hospitalization room poses a risk to the patient's health. Fig. 9 (a) shows some Android application interfaces for patients and their relatives, where the patient or a member of his relatives after logging in can view the list of visits that the nurse will make to the patient to follow his or her health, in addition to viewing the list of the patient's medications and the time to take each type of them, the recommendations of the supervising doctor, and the environmental condition of the hospitalization room. This Android application also provides notifications when the nurse's visit is approaching, the date of taking the medications is approaching, when the supervising doctor sends a recommendation, or when the environmental condition of the hospitalization room poses a risk to the patient's health. Fig. 9 (b) illustrates some Android application interfaces for system administrators, where this Android application enables them to manage the patient and their relatives' accounts, manage doctors' accounts, and manage nurses' accounts in addition to managing the home hospitalization process. The start and end date of each hospitalization process are determined for each patient, and scheduling the visits of the nurses to the patients, and the management of the environmental sensing units for each hospitalization room are done by adding an ID and Code PIN for each environmental sensing unit and linking it with the patient's account, and determining the ideal values for each environmental factor.

This system allows patients to recover and receive treatment in their homes and between their families and avoids for them the difficulties of moving to hospitals and the risk of infection with the new coronavirus, which is especially important for the elderly, who often suffer from chronic diseases and weak immunity. This system also addresses the problems of congestion and lack of resources suffered by most health institutions and hospitals during this period. Through this system, the health of the patients and the environmental condition of the hospitalization rooms are monitored remotely and periodically throughout the hospitalization period, which allows doctors to follow the processes of hospitalization and supervise the patients remotely.",

Furthermore, it can be applied in rich and developed countries, as in poor and developing countries.",

            "text": "Most of the smart healthcare systems proposed in recent years primarily monitor patients' health remotely using sensors and electronic devices connected to the Internet, that send patients' vital signs measurements to doctors in real time. At [24] for example, a smart IoT-based healthcare system is designed to allow measuring, viewing, and monitoring the patient's vitals using a set of sensors. This system also sends an alert to the doctor and the patient's family whenever the vitals reach or exceeds a certain limit. The data recorded in the form of an Excel sheet is also collected in Google Drive for future analysis, as it can be viewed through a web application and a mobile application. In Ref. [25] , an e-health system was also proposed to monitor the health of the elderly based on IoT and fog computing. This system allows the collection of physiological and public health parameters for the elderly periodically. It uses the Mysignals HW V2 platform and an Android application that plays the role of Fog server and enables the elderly and their families to monitor the health state, and communicate with healthcare providers. The problem with these two proposed systems is that they are based primarily on the Internet, and since in many regions, especially in developing countries, there is no connection to the Internet, and even if it exists, the speed of the Internet is low, we believe that such systems will not be implemented and accepted in most developing countries. They do not have good infrastructure for the Internet in all regions due to limited financial capabilities to provide smart sensors to monitor patient health remotely for all patients, unlike the developed and rich countries that can overcome these obstacles.",

In this proposed system, we will not need a vital signs sensing device for each patient to monitor its health, but we will need one device (vital signs sensing unit) for each nurse and a mobile application that plays the role of Fog server communicating with the vital signs sensing unit, through which the nurse measures the vital signs of patients and prepares medical reports at each visit. This application solves the Internet connection problem wherein case the Internet coverage does not reach the patient's home, this application will store data locally and send it to the Cloud at the first Internet connection. The environmental sensing unit is also distinguished by its low cost, as the cost of making its prototype is just a few dollars. This unit is installed in the hospitalization room at the start of each home hospitalization process, and at the end of the hospitalization process it is used for another patient hospitalization process; this of course reduces the cost of this system. This unit collects environmental factors data for the hospitalization room and sends it to the cloud via the Internet through a mobile application installed on a tablet device that plays the role of Fog server. The data is stored also locally in this application. The patient is alerted if these environmental factors represent a danger to him or her through this application (Fog server) without the need to connect to the Internet, and all supervisors of the patient are alerted via SMS. Alerts are sent to their mobile applications via the Fog server if there is an Internet connection. For data storage, Cloud computing platforms provide reliable storage that maintains data security and with low cost. This is why we chose the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform for data storage and the hosting of the applications of the proposed system.",

To detect most usability problems, it is acceptable to evaluate with five users as described in Ref. [55] ; based on this, five hospitalized patients between the ages of 45 and 61 years and five doctors were selected to conduct usability testing. To evaluate the proposed home hospitalization system, the system model was explained and a demonstration was made of its various applications for both patients and doctors, after which they were asked to complete the SUS questionnaire. The questionnaire is composed of 10 questions to assess system usability, where each of the questions is classified based on the amount of agreement, from one (Strongly Disagree) to five (Strongly Agree), as shown in Fig. 10(a) . After patients and doctors have finished answering questions, the SUS scores are calculated as shown in Fig. 10(b) . Table 2 displays the values of the SUS questionnaires provided by each patient, the SUS value per patient, and the average SUS calculated for all patients. Table 3 shows the values of the SUS questionnaires provided by each doctor, the SUS value per doctor, and the average SUS calculated for all doctors.",
