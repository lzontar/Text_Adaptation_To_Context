It forced all of us, as healthcare professionals and members of the general public, to change our ways in one way or another. Simple things such as the weekly food shop became more difficult. For healthcare professionals, conversations and decisions began to get a lot tougher, pressures increased. We started to feel the effects of 'moral injuries' a form of psychological distress, from actions or lack of actions that violates a person's moral code and affects our mental health (1, 2) . COVID-19 brought with it the need to adapt our working practices and adjust to the new needs of ourselves and our patients.",

A review radiographer has advanced skills and qualifications in symptom management, triage, emotional support and sign posting (3) . Most radiotherapy patients are reviewed on a weekly basis with input from radiation oncologist where required. As a radiation therapist (therapeutic radiographer) and member of the radiotherapy review team, I see patients throughout their radiotherapy treatments to address their physical and emotional side effects. At the core of our skill set as review radiographers are welldeveloped listening and interpersonal skills. Every review starts with the basics; making eye contact, smiling at the patient, listening and shaking their hand, to name a few\u2026 \"Hello, my name is Naman, I'm a member of our treatment review team, I'm just going to take you to one of our counselling rooms to check-in with you and have a discussion about treatment side effects.

PPE is an uncomfortable, but necessary addition to our physical working environment that affects interactions with colleagues and patients. Communication with patients is much more difficult as voices behind masks are muffled. Patients who are hard of hearing or deaf are unable to read our lips. Interactions between team members are hampered, impeding workflow and adding to tensions. This literal barrier to effective communication is a moral injury we faced on a daily basis through this pandemic.",

            "text": "Those of us in the radiotherapy review team have changed to telephone appointments to minimize time spent by patients in a hospital environment. Telephone reviews aren't a new process within healthcare (4); oncology teams use telephone triage when patients report treatment related side effects. Triage calls need to be efficient in finding out the problem while providing reassurance -they have a standard narrative: what is going on and how long for, what needs to be done, refer on appropriately, document and reflect (5) . Radiotherapy reviews are usually face-to-face and are scheduled for each patient. They often cover much more than just physical side effects and help build up a rapport with the patient. They can cover healthy lifestyle advice, explore support networks, promote wellbeing and can help provide reassurance. Face-to-face reviews provide the opportunity to pick up on non-verbal communication cues that you would miss through a telephone. In my opinion, radiotherapy reviews are more in depth than triage calls as they cover all aspects of a patient's care and side effects to help them live with and beyond cancer.",

The only friends he had were the ones he'd meet at the pub which was now off limits. During our chat he began to tell me about his garden. I remember thinking briefly, I have a long list of tasks to get through today and live in a flat with no garden but this is important to him. I think \"should I quickly google something about gardening?\" Then the patient says his wife used to love gardening and she made the garden look colorful and tidy when she was around\u2026then I heard him crying through the phone. At this point it was difficult not to feel guilty that I couldn't do more. The use of silence and listening has become even more important; I wonder whether this patient could have opened up like this had we been speaking face-to-face? Grief is difficult to overcome and stereotypes challenge all of us. The stereotype is that men don't cry. Especially men of a certain generation, and especially not to other men.",

It was sad and it upset me but it was an absolute privilege that while he was in his safe space, at home, he trusted me enough to confide in me and cry over the phone.

Change is inevitable, however uninvited it is. We all have had to adapt at what feels like breakneck speed. Patients and staff have been forced to accept technology. Some of our more 'mature' staff have been looking to younger staff to guide them. For some patients, seeing someone \"in person\" is their way of feeling looked after. It gives them the space to open up and engage with you. Our new normal is a virtual review room where boundaries need to be drawn with the patient. Distractions need to put aside. There are no more visual cues for you to pick up on and alter your approach. It is no longer eye contact and body language that we look for, but subtle changes in the tone of the patient's voice. It is difficult to empathize and console using just your voice. Use of silence and listening are really important. However, I found that being silent on the call for too long, waiting for the patient to answer a probing question, led a patient to think I wasn't there anymore and she hung up on me. This was embarrassing and amusing but at least I've learnt that on the phone you can't be silent for too long.
