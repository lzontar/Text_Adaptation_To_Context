Restrictive measures and health system disruption due to the pandemic may have deleterious effects on women's and children's health. 5 We conducted a retrospective study to compare the proportion of ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy necessitating emergency surgical intervention before and during COVID-19 lockdown period at our University Hospital in Bologna. Emergency surgical intervention was defined as one performed less than six hours from the patient's presentation to the hospital. We compared the proportion of women who underwent emergency surgical intervention for ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy among all cases of admitted ectopic pregnancies between two time periods: from January 1 st 2014 until before the lockdown in our region (February 29th 2020) and from March 1 st to 30 th April 2020. In our clinic, all tubal ectopic pregnancies were admitted to the hospital once diagnosed during both time periods.

Overall, 201 and 9 women with tubal ectopic pregnancies were admitted to our clinic in the first and second time periods, respectively. The proportion of ruptured ectopic pregnancies were significantly higher during the lockdown in comparison with the pre-lockdown period (6/9; 66.7% vs. 52/201; 25.9%, Fisher's Exact Test P = 0.02).",

Explaining the link between the pandemic and our findings is not straightforward. Possible explanation could be women's reluctance in seeking medical advice or the reduction of early first trimester scans which are quite popular but elective in our region.
