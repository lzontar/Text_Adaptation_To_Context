To this end, systematic testing of large population groups by RT-PCR is mandatory to case identification and contact tracing thereby minimizing the likelyhood of resurgence in contagion. 1 This approach faces a variety of obstacles, most notably the limited availability of reagents resources. Sample pooling for RT-PCR has been effectively used for screening of blood donors for Human immunodeficiency virus-1 and Hepatitis C virus in low-prevalence setttings. 2 This strategy has also been applied to detect community transmission of SARS CoV-2 in the United States early in the pandemic, when virus circulation was low. 3 Nevertheless, sample pooling may decrease the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays due to specimen dilution. Here, the efficacy of this strategy for diagnosis of Covid-19 was evaluated using a sensitive commercially-available RT-PCR (REALQUALITY RQ-2019-nCoV from AB ANALITICA; Padua, Italy, performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 instrument), and low-size mini-pools.

Previously reported data suggested that a single positive specimen could be detected in pools of up to 32 samples 5 , with a false negative rate of around 10%. In this work, pure RNA instead of original specimens were pooled for RT-PCR reactions. 6 Likewise, identification of cases was achieved in pools of 48 samples including 1-5 RT-PCR positive samples. Our experience was less satisfactory, yet, positive specimens that went undetected when tested in pools presumably had very low viral loads, as inferred by RT-PCR CT values, most likely <6 log 10 RNA copies/swab, which was shown to .

In summary, our data indicated that pooling NP specimens for RT-PCR testing may result in false negative results in patients presenting with mild Covid-19.
