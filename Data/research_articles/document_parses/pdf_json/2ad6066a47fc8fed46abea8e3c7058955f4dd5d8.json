Because of the critical role played by serological assays for SARS diagnosis, an in-house ELISA based on SARS-CoV recombinant antigens was developed. The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (N), three N fragments (N1, N2, and N3) and the intraviral domain of the membrane protein (M2) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as histidine-tagged proteins. Six reference sera from SARS patients were used to detect virus-specific IgG in an ELISA using each recombinant protein as coating antigen. High-titre positive reactions were detected in all SARS positive sera. The specificity of the assay appears to be high as no positive reaction was detected in the sera of 20 healthy subjects and 73 patients with non-SARS, low-tract respiratory infections. Specific hyper-immune sera to SARS-CoV and the recombinant proteins, N, N1, N2, N3, and M2 were also generated in mice and rabbits. The specificity of these sera was confirmed by an immunocytochemical assay on biochips of SARS-CoV infected and uninfected cells.",

A new Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent of this syndrome, accordingly, molecular, virological, and serological tests have been developed for its identification Poon et al., 2004b] . Although retrospective in nature, serological tests are of utmost importance either to confirm or rule out infection by the virus and for seroprevalence studies. In this context, the viral nucleocapsid protein N and the membrane protein M are recognized as useful antigens to monitor antibody response in other coronavirus infections [Ndifuna et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2003; Elia et al., 2003] . The N and M antigen have been also used to detect anti-SARS-CoV antibodies. Despite intense research in this area [Ndifuna et al., 1998; Che et al., 2003; Shi et al., 2003 Shi et al., , 2004a Leung et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2004] , the need for further improvements of SARS serology is widely recognized [Poon et al., 2004a] .",

            "text": "N and M structural SARS-CoV proteins were chosen to develop an ELISA test to detect specific antiviral antibodies. The N and M full-length genes were amplified from heat and gamma-irradiated cell culture supernatant of Vero E6 cells infected with the SARS-CoV isolate Frankfurt 1. The amplified cDNAs were cloned in the expression vector pQE-30 (QIAGEN), obtaining the p-N and p-M constructs, respectively. The C-terminus, extra-membrane tail of the M protein (138-222 amino acids) was cloned and sequenced (Fig. 1,  panel a) . The deduced amino acid sequences of each insert were compared with the N and M sequences of the SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 isolate revealing a 100% amino acid identity, thus assuring that the cloning methods had no inserted spurious amino acid variations. While the whole protein M could not be generated, probably for its toxicity in E. coli, the recombinant M2 fragment as well as the full length N protein were successfully expressed in E. coli (Fig. 1, panel b) . Recombinant proteins were purified and used as coating antigens in ELISA set up to analyze the 6 SARS-positive human sera. Twenty human sera from healthy blood donors and 73 SARS-negative sera from patients affected by acute respiratory syndromes with viral (non-SARS) or bacterial etiology were used as negative controls. All sera from SARS patients showed a strong positive reaction against N and M2 antigen. In contrast, no positive reaction was observed in any serum from non-SARS subjects with the dilution cut-off considered, suggesting a high specificity of the test. Figure 2 particularly shows the titration curves of the 6 SARS serum samples obtained by ELISA with the use of M2 (panel a) and the whole N antigen (panel b). It also shows that the anti-M2 antibody titre was generally lower than the anti-N titre, nonetheless, the anti-M2 response showed particularly low inter-subject variability, as compared to the anti-N response. The mean OD reading values of the six SARS sera tested against either M2 or N antigens, at the dilution of 1: 600 and 1:2,000, respectively, are shown in Figure 2 , panel c, together with the values of the 93 non-SARS subjects (OD < 0.2). All hightitre ELISA results were confirmed by Western blotting showing the expected immuno-reactive viral protein band (data not shown). Three N fragments (N1, N2, N3) were also expressed as described in Methods (Fig. 1, panel a) . The deduced protein sequences of each N fragment were compared with the N sequences of the SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 isolate revealing a 100% amino acid identity with the exception of the p-N2 construct where the Tyr at position 248 was replaced by Ala. The three N fragments were purified and used as coating antigen in ELISA to analyze the six SARS-CoV reference sera (Fig. 3) . In all cases, clear-cut positive reactions of the six SARS-positive human sera were detected. In particular, the central N portion (N2) (panel b), demonstrated high levels of positive reaction, with an OD average value (at the dilution of 1:2,000) of 1.8 AE 0.6, with respect to the negative sera 0.05 AE 0.04. The N1 and N3 proteins generated a lower positive reaction, reaching at the 1:600 dilution the OD average values of 0.6 AE 0.1 (negative sera mean values: 0.07 AE 0.05) and 0.7 AE 0.3 (negative sera mean values: 0.09 AE 0.07), respectively. The specificity of the this ELISA assay (Fig. 2 , panel e; Fig. 3 , panel d) would appear to be rather high as no positive reaction was observed in the N-and N2-based ELISA at the 1:2,000 dilution and only two out of the 93 SARS-negative sera showed a weak positive reaction against all antigens at the 1:600 dilution, reading however twofold lower than the mean SARS-positive sera values. No positive reaction with any non-SARS sera was however observed at 1:1,200 dilution.",

Thus, all the five SARS-CoV recombinant proteins were purified and inoculated either in rabbit or in mice in order to generate specific hyperimmune sera. All viral proteins showed high immunogenicity in both animal species, inducing specific antibodies, reactive both in ELISA and Western blotting (data not shown). The specificity of the sera was examined further by an immunocytochemical assay on slides containing a mixing of mock and SARS-CoV-infected cell. All sera showed strong reactivity against the infected cells, with a comparable pattern of cellular staining. In Figure 4 the immunocytochemical assays obtained with the anti-N and anti-M2 rabbit sera at the dilution of 1:1,600, are shown. In particular, the anti-N and anti-M2 rabbit sera could still detect viral antigen at the 1:25,000 dilution (data not shown). The anti-SARS-CoV murine sera generally showed a lower titre, irrespective of the antigen used (1:10,000). Both animal sera showed no cross-reactivity with other human Coronavirus (data not shown).",

In addition, our recombinant proteins have been found to be useful for the generation of hyperimmune sera to use for the detection of viral antigens in clinical specimens.
