The alkynes 30a\u00c0d and 31a\u00c0d were applied in the 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions with azides 27 and 28 to synthesize acyclic 1,2,3triazole nucleosides. The obtained alkynes and 1,2,3-triazole were evaluated for antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. The alkyne 30d showed activity against adenovirus-2 (EC 50 \u00bc 8.3 mM), while compounds 37a and 37d were also active toward herpes simplex virus-1 wildtype and thymidine kinase deficient (HSV-1 TK \u00c0 ) strains (EC 50 values in the range of 4.6-13.8 mM). In addition, compounds 30a, 30b, 37b, and 37c exhibited activity toward varicella-zoster virus (VZV) TK + and TK \u00c0 strains (EC 50 \u00bc 2.1-9.5 mM). The compound 30b proved to be the most selective against VZV and displayed marginal activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).

Among them, acyclovir and penciclovir exhibit activity against herpes viruses including HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , while ganciclovir [7, [8] [9] [10] and valganciclovir \u00c0 its prodrug with significantly improved oral bioavailability [10] [11] [12] \u00c0 are commonly used as anti-cytomegalovirus agents. However, in most cases, the clinical applications of nucleosides are limited due to the observed side effects. In addition, an important problem in treatment of viral infections is the emergence of drug-resistant mutant viruses. For this reason, the search for new antiviral compounds with improved activity has been continuing for decades. This is not limited to modifications of aliphatic chains, but also includes the introduction of additional groups into the structure of nucleosides with well-documented biological activity. Since the 1,2,3-triazole moiety has been recognized as bioisosteric with the amide function [13, 14] , the incorporation of this structural motive has been widely applied and resulted in a broad spectrum of pharmaceutically important molecules. Furthermore, 1,2,3-triazoles are able to form hydrogen bonds, they are not protonated at the physiological pH, and are also stable to oxidation and reduction as well as to many enzymatic reactions [15] . Several compounds of the 1,2,3-triazole family have exhibited a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory [16, 17] , anticonvulsants [18] , antiviral [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , anticancer [24] [25] [26] [27] , antimicrobial agents [28] [29] [30] , as well as b-lactamase inhibitors [31] and dopamine D2 receptor ligands related to schizophrenia [32] . Since 1997, when the first acyclic 1,2,3-triazolenucleosides have been obtained by Lazrek et al. [33, 34] , many efforts have been made by several research groups to synthesize more potent antiviral and anticancer nucleoside analogs having both natural and modified nucleobases ( Fig. 1 ) [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 125, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 126, "end": 128, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 262, "end": 265, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 266, "end": 269, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 270, "end": 273, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 274, "end": 277, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 278, "end": 281, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 302, "end": 305, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 306, "end": 309, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 310, "end": 313, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 314, "end": 318, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 401, "end": 405, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 406, "end": 410, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 411, "end": 415, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1095, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1099, "text": "14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1445, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1583, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1587, "text": "17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1606, "end": 1610, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1627, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1628, "end": 1632, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1637, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1638, "end": 1642, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1643, "end": 1647, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1665, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1666, "end": 1670, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1671, "end": 1675, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1680, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1708, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1713, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1718, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1759, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1822, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1922, "end": 1926, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1927, "end": 1930, "text": "34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2114, "end": 2118, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2119, "end": 2123, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2124, "end": 2128, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2133, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2138, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2139, "end": 2143, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2144, "end": 2148, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2153, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2154, "end": 2158, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2163, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2164, "end": 2168, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2169, "end": 2173, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2174, "end": 2178, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2183, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2184, "end": 2188, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2105, "end": 2111, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Among various heterocyclic moieties that would serve as modified nucleobase mimetics, substituted quinazoline-2,4-diones are of special interest.

Initially, we considered the respective N 3 -benzoylated quinazoline-2,4-diones as convenient substrates for the preparation of N 3 -benzoyl-N 1propargylquinazoline-2,4-diones 30a (Scheme 2). The N 3benzoylquinazoline-2,4-dione 40 was previously obtained from 2-benzoylaminobenzoxazinone, although with low (less than 5%) overall yield [71] Recently, we reported [57] the synthesis of N 3 -benzoyl-N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-diones 30a from quinazoline-2,4-dione 38 in 19% overall yield (Scheme 2).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 117, "end": 121, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 196, "end": 200, "text": "[69,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 201, "end": 204, "text": "70]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 570, "end": 574, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and discussion Chemistry"}, {"text": "However, this procedure suffers from several steps including benzoylation of 38 to N 1 ,N 3 -dibenzoylquinazoline-2,4dione 39, requires a selective N 1 -debenzoylation and finally propargylation. Unfortunately, in this method, the selective N 1 -debenzoylation step appeared less effective and tedious. For this reason, another strategy for the synthesis of N 3benzoyl-N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-diones 30a was devised (Scheme 3). It started from propargylation of commercially available isatoic anhydride 41 followed by the reaction of the compound 42 with urea [72] to give N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-dione 29. Finally, the key compound 29 could be transformed into substituted both N 3 -benzoyl-and N 3 -benzyl-N 1propargylquinazoline-2,4-diones 30a\u00c0d and 31a\u00c0d via the reaction with the respective benzoyl chlorides and benzyl bromides (Scheme 3). The standard benzoylation of N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4dione 29 with benzoyl chlorides in the presence of triethylamine led to the formation of N 3 -benzoylated N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-diones 30a\u00c0d in moderate to good yields without formation of by-products. At first, attempts at benzylation of N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-dione 29 following the strategy previously described [67] for the synthesis of N 1 -allylated N 3 -benzoylquinazoline-2,4-dione were undertaken. Treatment of 29 with benzyl bromide in the presence of potassium hydroxide at 105\u00b0C for 4 h or 60\u00b0C for 48 h led to the formation of ca. a 50:50 mixture of an alkyne 31a and an allene 43a in 79% total yield. Unfortunately, several attempts at elaborating the efficient procedure to separate N 3 -benzyl-N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-diones 31a from N 3 -benzyl-N 1 -(propa-1,2-dien-1-yl)quinazoline-2,4-diones 43a on silica gel columns or by crystallization proved fruitless. Fortunately, we were able to chromatographically isolate a small amount of pure allene 43a. Attempts to optimize a procedure for benzylation of 29, thereby avoiding formation of allenes 43 were undertaken. Thus, the treatment of N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-dione 29 with benzyl bromide in the presence of potassium carbonate in DMF at room temperature for 48 h afforded pure N 3 -benzyl-N 1 -propargylquinazoline-2,4-dione 31a and no traces of the allene 43a were observed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 566, "end": 570, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1250, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and discussion Chemistry"}, {"text": "The H\u20ac uisgen reaction of the azide 27 with the alkyne 29 could be accomplished within 21 days when the reaction mixture was heated at 45\u00b0C.
