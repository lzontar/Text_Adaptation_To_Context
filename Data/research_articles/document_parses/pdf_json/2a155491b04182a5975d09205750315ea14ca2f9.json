Second, the household is a key setting for SARS-CoV-2 transmission (7) . The average size of households that have a resident over the age of 65 years is substantially higher in lower income countries (Fig. 1B) compared with middle-and high-income countries, increasing the potential for spread generally but also specifically to this particularly vulnerable age-group. Contact patterns between age-groups also differ by country ( fig. S5 ); in high-income settings the number of contacts tends to decline steeply with age. This effect is more moderate in middle-income settings and disappears in low-income settings, indicating that elderly individuals in these settings (LICs and MICs) maintain higher contact rates with a wider range of agegroups compared to elderly individuals in high-income countries (HICs). These contact patterns influence the predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection attack rate across age-groups ( Fig. 1 , C to E) with higher attack rates in the elderly predicted in lowincome settings compared to high-income settings and middle-income settings showing intermediate patterns.",

Assuming the same availability of health care (equivalent to that provided in China) throughout the pandemic, we would expect a lower overall per-capita risk of mortality in lower income settings due to the younger age of the populations (Fig. 1I ).",

This effect is likely to be more extreme in lower-income settings where health care capacity is typically limited. To explore this, using data derived from the World Bank and wider literature, we developed a model of the supply of health care relevant to COVID-19 disease. We use a boosted regression tree-based approach to model the likely availability of hospital beds (per 1000 population, from the World Bank) based on a suite of relevant health care-related and socio-economic covariates (also from the World Bank, see Materials and Methods). This prediction of hospital bed capacity was then combined with estimates of intensive care unit beds (per 100 hospital beds) across a range of different settings (spanning LICs, LMICs, UMICs and HICs) identified through a systematic literature review (Fig. 2) . These estimates of health care capacity were then integrated with our estimates of the demand that COVID-19 epidemics will place on national health systems.",

Lower and upper middle-income countries (LMIC/UMICs) fall between these two extremes (1.77 and 2.63 beds per 1000 population on average, respectively). We find that the percentage of hospital beds that are in intensive care units (ICU) is lowest in LICs (1.47% on average) and highest in HICs (3.30%) with LMICs and UMICs falling in-between (2.00% and 2.88% respectively) (Fig. 2C ).

These expert estimates drew on recent experience treating COVID-19 patients in the UK alongside an understanding of severe pneumonia outcomes in LIC and LMIC settings. Mechanical ventilation (MV) -which has been required by 80% of COVID-19 ICU patients in the UK (9)-is of very limited capacity in many LIC and LMIC countries -across sub-Saharan Africa for example, recent estimates put the average number of ventilators at only 172 per country (10) .. In the absence of MV, the consensus was that the mortality rate would be in the range 90-100%. This compares to a mortality rate of 51.6% in those that require MV in the UK (9) . Similarly, for the 20% of individuals that would be admitted to ICU in the UK but not require MV, the consensus was that mortality would be 50-65% in an LIC/LMIC setting. It was however noted that there would likely be significant heterogeneity in this rate (not captured here) due to the variation in both the quality of hospital care and availability of hospital facilities within and between countries (with better facilities concentrated in urban areas and capital cities compared to rural areas). For those with severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization, mortality rates are expected to be higher in LICs and LMICs than in HICs. The values for LICs and LMICs assumed here are a mortality rate across all age-groups of 20-30% if oxygen support is available while anticipating that this may not be at sufficiently high-flow directly at the bedside to ensure comparable outcomes to HIC (\"Poorer Outcomes\" in Fig. 2 ) and 60% if oxygen support is not available (due to health care capacity being exceeded). Using these parameters, we expect a larger proportion of deaths to occur in those aged 40 and upwards in LIC and LMIC settings (Fig. 2D ) and that the lack of quality oxygen support will disproportionately increase mortality in younger age-groups (as these agegroups are more likely to require oxygen support than mechanical ventilation). Importantly, the lack of health system capacity is likely to increase the overall IFR in LIC and LMIC settings, off-setting the apparent protective effects of the younger population (Fig. 2E ). In our subsequent modelling, we therefore examined three scenarios for LICs/LMICs to examine the impact of health care quality and quantity upon potential COVID-19 burden: a scenario where there were no health care constraints and quality of care was similar to HICs (\"Unlimited health care\"), a scenario using typical health care constraints on hospital and ICU beds in Fig. 2 , B and C (\"Limited health care\") and a scenario where there is an assume absence of mechanical ventilation and treatment for severe pneumonia is less effective (\"Limited health care, No MV and poorer outcomes\").",

However, clear risk factors include age (5) and underlying co-morbidities that include hypertension, diabetes, coronary vascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which serve to exacerbate symptoms (11) . The prevalence of these conditions varies substantially across populations and by age (Fig. 3 ). Using Global Burden of Disease 2017 estimates (12), our unmitigated scenario leads to 6.1%, 3.8% and 13.3% of SARS-CoV-2 infections occurring in individuals with CVD, COPD and diabetes respectively. In low-income (LIC) and low-middle income countries (LMIC) there is a higher burden of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and TB, and of poverty-related determinants of poorer health outcomes such as malnutrition than in HICs. These generally occur in younger populations (Fig. 3 , D to F). While infectious diseases and malnutrition are not yet recognized as specific risk-factors for poor prognosis from COVID-19 due to a lack of data from settings in which they are prevalent, it is possible that the risk profile in LIC and LMIC settings will be very different from that observed to date in China, Europe and North America. Understanding the extent to which these potential comorbidities make younger populations more vulnerable to severe sequalae of COVID-19 and designing strategies to protect them will be important in adapting pandemic responses to lower income countries.",

As for the SIR final size calculations, we use demographic data and social contact patterns based on representative settings in the LIC, LMIC, UMIC and HIC strata. Disease progression for those requiring hospitalization was explicitly modeled in order to track requirements for hospital bed provision for severe pneumonia (for whom we assume oxygen support will be required) and for ICU provision (for whom we assume 80% would require MV in-line with UK data (9)). Durations of stay were based on UK data (9, 13) ; while it is likely that these will be shorter in LIC and LMIC countries, in the absence of data to guide these parameters the results presented here are conservative (i.e., hospital capacity will be exceeded earlier). While health care seeking behavior may also differ across settings, we make the simplifying assumption that all symptomatic cases seek care. To capture the uncertainty in hospital demand we generated 500 parameter sets drawing on uncertainty in key parameters determining the probability of hospitalization, of requiring critical care, and of outcomes (death or recovery) in each hospital state and ran 10 stochastic realization using each parameter set (see Materials and Methods). The 95% range across the simulations is presented as an uncertainty interval (UI). We consider two potential strategies (similar to those previously illustrated for pandemic influenza planning and in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic (14, 15)); (1) mitigationwhereby transmission is reduced but Rt remains above 1 and hence a single-peaked epidemic is predicted due to the buildup of herd immunity; and (2) suppression -whereby transmission is reduced such that Rt<1 and hence, if interventions are later released, transmission will be expected to rise as herd immunity will not have been achieved.",

            "text": "We used our final SIR size calculations to estimate the degree of social distancing that results in \"optimal\" mitigation. This is defined as the maximum reduction in transmission that can be achieved if a uniform reduction in contact rates is implemented at the start of the epidemic for an undefined but finite period such that Rt~1 and a single-peaked epidemic is generated (see Materials and Methods). If \"optimal\" mitigation based on enhanced social distancing is pursued, for an R0 of 3.0, we estimate a maximum reduction in infections in individual countries in the range 30-38% (median 33%) and a range of reduction in mortality between 19%-55% (median 39%) (assuming the mortality patterns observed in China). These optimal reductions in transmission and burden were achieved with a range of reductions in the overall rate of social contact across countries between 40.0%- 44 (table S5) . This lower proportional reduction in deaths of mitigation scenarios in lower income settings is driven by the more homogeneous contact patterns by age in these settings ( Fig. 1) , resulting in more persistent spread to older age categories as contact rates in the general population are reduced ( fig. S6 ). Figure 4 highlights the dynamical impact of different control measures on COVID-19 epidemics. Scenarios in which in which the COVID-19 epidemic is suppressed for a period of six months before returning to pre-pandemic social contact patterns leads to rapid resurgence of the virus and a delayed peaking epidemic (Fig. 4A ). There is significant reduction in disease burden under the optimal mitigation strategy, which results in a single-peaked epidemic with a substantially lower peak compared to the unmitigated epidemic. It should be noted, however, that this single peak relies upon the assumption that recovery from infection confers durable immunity to reinfection which has yet to have been conclusively demonstrated (16) . Furthermore, while \"optimal\" mitigation is the strategy that will minimize infections and achieve herd immunity in a single-peaked epidemic, there are multiple other strategies that can also minimize infections over a longerterm (17, 18) . Any mitigation scenario will also always be worse in terms of both the peak hospital demand and total predicted deaths than scenarios in which the epidemic is suppressed (i.e., the reproduction number over time, Rt, is kept below 1) (Fig. 4, A and B) . However, if suppression cannot be successfully maintained, then a delayed epidemic may occur which may outweigh the benefits of the original suppression strategy and result in higher mortality than if a mitigation scenario had been successfully pursued. Such a second peak is not inevitable -widescale suppression may provide countries with the time to develop testing and contact tracing systems, as well as locally targeted responses, that can help to maintain lower levels of transmission once the initial suppression interventions are relaxed. It is important to note that our framework does not currently provide insights into the specific combinations of NPIs required to achieve such reductions and these are likely to differ across settings according to various factors such as school attendance and occupational factors. Other factors such as reduced ability to work from home and general economic vulnerability will impact on the abilities of populations to adhere to stringent NPIs that involve restrictions in movement. Meanwhile, larger household sizes, and subsequently higher levels of household-based transmission, may limit the impact of selfisolation and increase the social and economic impact of selfisolation measures in lower income settings.",

Although we predict lower demand for critical care in lower income settings due to their younger populations, this is likely to be offset by a much lower level of supply: for our mitigation scenario including populationlevel social distancing, peak demand for critical care in our simulation for a typical LIC outstrips supply by a factor of 30.7 (95% UI, 14.7 -48.8), whereas for the equivalent simulation in a typical HIC this factor was 7.8 (95% UI 3.6 -13.0) (Fig. 4C) .

This may partly be due to censoring (i.e., other countries have yet to impose suppression measures since the date the dataset was downloaded -April 20 th 2020) as well as due to the wider recognition of the potential impact of COVID-19 that countries in other regions can observe from the ongoing epidemics in Europe.

The extent to which reported case-to-death ratios are a reliable indicator of relative case or infection (including asymptomatic) ascertainment rates will depend upon trends in IFR, the reproduction number and the extent to which deaths are reported, all of which are liable to vary across income strata. However, this trend is suggestive of the extent to which testing capacity will need to be developed in LICs/LMICs settings if approaches such as case identification coupled with contact tracing are to form part of a successful mitigation or exit strategy.",

            "text": "Given our estimates suggest that even optimal mitigative strategies will lead to substantial excess mortality and exceedance of health care capacity, we explored the impact of potentially different suppressive strategies, accounting for the interventions that countries have implemented to date. Here we define suppression as reducing transmission to a level for which Rt<1. To do so we model a 75% reduction in contact rates across all age-groups, giving Rt=0.75 for R0=3.0. We explored different trigger thresholds based on the incidence of cases requiring critical care per 100,000 population) for the implementation of transmission reductions and modeled these as lasting for 30 days before being lifted (typical of the duration of lockdowns occurring to date). Reimplementation then occurs if the trigger threshold is eclipsed again. The level of reduction in contact rates will determine the speed at which the infected population is depleted during the intervention (24) . Thus, for a fixed period of intervention (assumed here to be 1 month) either starting earlier (i.e., at lower levels of infection) or suppressing to a greater extent (i.e., higher reductions in contact rates) will mean that interventions can be relaxed for longer before the trigger for reimplementation is reached (Fig. 5A) . Equally, if a degree of suppression is maintained during the period of relaxation (for example, a 30% reduction in contacts during relaxation compared to 75% during suppression), then the periods in suppression will be shorter as the reduced Rt during relaxation will mean that it takes longer to trigger the suppression threshold. Furthermore, a greater health benefit (in terms of reducing cases or deaths) will be achieved for lower trigger levels; however, this is balanced by a slower build-up of herd immunity such that the interventions would need to remain in place for longer in the absence of a vaccine (Fig. 5B) .",

For each scenario, we modeled the first suppression to have been initiated at the median threshold for the setting that has been observed to date (i.e., LIC and LMIC initiate earlier than UMIC and HIC, Table 1 ). We then selected the ICU incidence trigger within this range that minimizes COVID-19 mortality over 18 months and remains under our ICU threshold. We use a time window of 18 months as representative of the timescale over which pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., a vaccine) may become available, noting that this duration is highly uncertain (25) .",

            "text": "If ICU demand is to be kept below the estimated median ICU capacity for each income strata, all countries are predicted to need to spend a substantial proportion of time in suppression (Fig. 5C) . In all settings, in the absence of additional effective measures, we estimate that the time spent in suppression to prevent health services becoming overwhelmed will need to be high across all settings, and marginally higher in LICs (77% vs 66% in HICs over an 18month timeframe) driven by the lower threshold at which suppression has to be reapplied coupled with the resulting less rapid acquisition of immunity. Assuming identical quality but not quantity of care across all settings, the mortality rate under suppression is predicted to be highest in HICs across all suppression threshold triggers considered (and by extension, time in suppression over the next 18 months) due to their older populations (Fig. 5D, purple lines) . However, once we incorporate our estimates of the poorer quality of care in LICs and LMICs we predict a similar number of deaths in LIC and LMIC compared to HICs across all suppression triggers. Thus, in all settings, sustained periods of suppression over the next 18 months are predicted to be required if ICU demand is to be kept below capacity and large levels of excess mortality are to be averted. Conversely, we also estimate that the risks of not maintaining suppression are likely to be similarly high across all settings. If suppression is not maintained (and hence the proportion of time spent in lockdown over the next 18 months is low), then our results suggest a lower per-capita level of burden LIC/LMIC due to the younger population. However, the uncertainty in our estimates of the quality of care in these settings could mean that this result is reversed (Fig. 5D ). Our estimates of increasing time between suppression triggers in HICs in Fig. 5E assume that there is durable immunity to reinfection -this remains uncertain (16) . However, given the very low levels of population immunity in LIC/LMICs at 18 months in the presence of this assumption, our results indicate that in these settings measures would have to remain in place well beyond the time window of our simulations in the absence of a vaccine in order to achieve herd immunity, or equivalent effective exit strategy able to maintain control of the epidemic for values of Rt that remain close to R0. Importantly, however, these results do not account for other interventions that could be implemented during periods where suppressive measures are not in place. Once the number of new infections drops to a manageable level, it is likely that more widespread testing and isolation of cases coupled with contact tracing can help to prevent a resurgence of transmission, as has been observed in countries such as South Korea (26) (27) (28) . However, given the low reported case to reported death ratios in LICs/LMICs during the early stage of the pandemic, for such strategies to be successful it is likely that support to enhance surveillance will be required to increase infection ascertainment rates substantially. Such testing strategies could be supplemented by the additional use of technology including digital apps (29) . The appropriateness of these different interventions will be context-specific and hence it is likely that each country will need to develop strategies based on an understanding of the underlying principles outlined here but adapted to suit their needs.",

Given the likely worse prognosis of severe COVID-19 cases in settings with weaker health systems coupled with the higher vulnerability of developing economies to the negative effects of stringent NPIs, the trade-offs lower income countries face are complex given the ongoing uncertainty in the most appropriate and effective exit strategies. In the interim, the priority should be to increase the availability of oxygen support to mitigate the health impact alongside enhancing the capacity for surveillance and widescale testing to reduce the spread of infection and tailor appropriate NPIs. In the longer-term, ensuring equitable provision of pharmaceutical interventions to lower income countries once they are developed should be a global priority. Our analysis demonstrates the extent to which countries have mobilised to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Many lower income countries have acted while transmission remains at low levels which is likely to have substantially slowed the spread of the virus. In the absence of a vaccine, all governments are likely to face challenging decisions around intervention strategies for the foreseeable future. However, the still relevant counterfactual of a largely unmitigated pandemic clearly demonstrates the extent to which rapid, decisive and collective action remains critical to save lives globally. (Page numbers not final at time of first release) 13 The baseline are estimates based on data for highincome settings. \"No MV\" denotes not being able to access an ICU unit with mechanical ventilation available. \"Poorer outcomes\" represents a higher risk of mortality from severe pneumonia in an LMIC setting if only limited or poor-quality oxygen support is available. \"No Oxygen\" represents the outcomes if hospitalized patients do not receive oxygen support. The stacked bars represent the cumulative increase in IFR at each stage. Note that the final stage \"No MV and No Oxygen\" represents the additional IFR due to increasing mortality rates from 20% in the presence of limited/poor-quality oxygen support to 60% in the absence of any oxygen support. (E) Estimated representative IFR averaged across age-groups in different settings under a range of health care quality assumptions. The differences between LIC, LMIC, UMIC and HIC at baseline reflect the demography and social contact patterns but otherwise assume the same health care quality. Lower health care quality is not shown for UMIC and HIC as these settings are likely to have the quality of health care incorporated in the baseline estimates.

Representative epidemic trajectories for an unmitigated epidemic (grey line), an epidemic involving minimal social distancing (pale blue line, 20% reduction in social contacts), an epidemic involving extensive social distancing (teal, 45% reduction in social contacts) and an epidemic trajectory that involves extensive suppression (75% reduction in social contacts) followed by lift after 6 months, leading to resurgence (dark blue line).
