Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for corona virus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention.

In contrast, a lack of meaningful social connections-including \u2017objective' social isolation (e.g., few social ties or low frequency of social interactions), social support, and loneliness 2 -are associated with reduced quality of life (well-being, depressive symptoms), 3, 4 unhealthy behaviors (smoking, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise), [5] [6] [7] and adverse health outcomes (cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, pain, fatigue, insomnia, depression, dementia, suicide, and all-cause mortality). 3, 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The risk of premature mortality due to a lack of social connection is comparable to the risk due to maintaining an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, alcohol misuse, and smoking. 15 The importance of maintaining social connections is especially salient at the time this article is being prepared due to the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of social distancing practices that are likely to negatively impact social connections for many older adults.

At the beginning of the 20 th century, Durkheim offered a sociological perspective on suicide, including the observation that changes in social dynamics at the societal level tracked closely with population-wide increases in suicide rates. 16 This concept can be observed when considering changes in suicide rates in the wake of national tragedies: some tragedies are associated with reduced suicide rates, whereas others are associated with increased suicide rates. 17, 18 One hypothesis to describe this phenomenon is societal -pulling together\u2016 versus -pulling apart.\u2016 Pulling together may involve an increased sense of belonging to a community, of being \u2017in it together,' and of being part of a larger whole, and has been posited to be a contributor to reduced rates of suicide following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, 19 the Challenger disaster in 1986, 17 and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. 20 It is important to note, however, that suicide rates following September 11, 2001 may differ across subgroups 21 and that not all experts agree on how to best analyze and interpret the effects of national tragedies on suicide rates. 22 In contrast, tragedies that cause geographic displacement or social distancing (e.g., natural disasters, pandemics) may be associated with \u2017pulling apart' effects in communities and contribute to increases in mental health problems and suicide. The 2003 SARS epidemic was associated with a significant increase in suicide deaths among older adult women in Hong Kong (but not young adults or older men) in the year after the outbreak, with the greatest number of suicide deaths occurring one month after the outbreak began when the greatest number of SARS cases were documented. 23 Fears of contracting the illness and thereby burdening family, as well as fears of social disconnection, were contributing factors to suicide deaths of older women in Hong Kong at this time. 24 Of course, changes in suicide rates at the population level do not directly apply to an individual patient (cf., ecological fallacy); rather, we discuss these findings here because they illustrate several essential points for clinicians to keep in mind: 1) social factors can and do shape health at both a population and individual level; 2) the presence of stress or tragedy does not in and of itself ensure isolation and increased mental health problems, but the response we have to tragedy can become a self-fulfilling prophecy or an opportunity for growth.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 322, "end": 324, "text": "16", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 549, "end": 552, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 553, "end": 555, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 930, "end": 932, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 966, "end": 968, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1020, "text": "September 11, 2001. 20", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1133, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1256, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1835, "end": 1837, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2029, "end": 2031, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strategies to Promote Social Connections Among Older Adults During \u2017Social Distancing'"}, {"text": "The scientific literature on behavioral interventions to promote social connections (at all ages) is limited.

Three forms of connectedness are especially salient for helping older adults during COVID-19. 34 Social isolation refers to characteristics of social ties and networks that are insufficient, such as infrequent visits/calls with family/friends. Second, social support involves the functions that relationships provide, including information, instrumental support (e.g., assistance with activities of daily living), and emotional support. The third domain is the psychological experience of feeling isolated or connected (e.g., loneliness, belonging). All three domains are included in a 17-item questionnaire designed for use with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic-the Questionnaire for Assessing the impact of the COVID -19 Pandemic on Older Adults 34 (available for free at https://www.qiacpoa.com).

Thus, teaching an older patient to understand his/her experience of loneliness/isolation through the cognitive behavioral lens can foster a sense of agency and control as well as identify tailored intervention strategies to reduce distress.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A Cognitive Behavioral Model of Social Isolation"}, {"text": "When educating patients about how perspectives of a stressful event like social distancing can impact our emotional and behavioral responses to it, clinicians must be careful not to invalidate an older patient's experience by seeming to \u2017blame' their stress on their perspective. Rather, clinicians should explain that our perspective-and how we think about our experience-is one aspect of a stressful situation over which we have control. To illustrate the relationship between thoughts and feelings (cf., the \u2017cognitive model'), clinicians may wish to use examples that are not from the patient's own life experience, particularly if this is the first time the patient is learning this concept. Emotionally-laden experiences can complicate learning the concept that \u2017thoughts can cause feelings' because patients focus on the content of the thoughts rather than the process of how thoughts in general influence feelings. To teach this concept in the context of social isolation, clinicians could use an exercise such as is depicted in Figure 2 , which includes a \u2017matching exercise' whereby patients and clinicians can discuss how different interpretations of being alone in one's home due to social distancing can be associated with different thoughts and therefore different emotional reactions. The implication for patients, of course, is that we all have the power to \u2017talk back to thoughts' in order to change our emotional experience. Table 1 includes three basic cognitive strategies clinicians can use to help patients challenge thoughts that may exacerbate loneliness and increase distress. There are three questions patients can ask themselves to identify possible negative and unhelpful thoughts and ways to challenge (or \u2017talk back to') those thoughts; some of these strategies are adapted from the strategies to address \u2017negativity bias' in psychotherapy for depression in later life 36 and we have adapted them successfully for use with isolated and lonely older adults. Table 1 also lists another strategy to change thoughts/perspectives-mindfulness-based meditation, which some research has demonstrated may reduce loneliness in older adults. 37 In fact, a mobile-health delivered mindfulness training program has also been shown to reduce loneliness and increase social activities among adults reporting above average stress. 38 This m-health study suggested that orientation to the present moment (versus rumination about the past or worry about the future) with mindful acceptance was the mechanism that accounted for reduced loneliness and increased daily social contact. Mindfulness training programs commonly teach participants emotion regulation skills-the process by which individuals are aware of, understand, accept, and successfully modify the experience and expression of their emotions. 39 Mindfulness training does this by teaching people to use their attention to approach their thoughts and emotions, rather than avoid them, and to do so with acceptance rather than shame or anger. 40 Emerging evidence suggests that mindfulness training can also improve interpersonal processes, including social communication, relationship satisfaction, and compassion toward others. 41, 42 Compassion, meaning to suffer together, is a multidimensional process of bringing awareness to suffering, with intention to respond to and relieve the suffering, and can be directed toward the self and others. 43 Another meditative practice known as lovingkindness, a concept akin to benevolence and goodwill, is a series of exercises designed to cultivate and enhance kindness and compassion toward the self and others. Research on loving-kindness supports evidence of increased positive emotions, 44 less psychological distress, 45 and increased social connectedness. 46 Therefore, introducing patients to mindfulness and loving-kindness training during social distancing restrictions may improve emotion regulation and social functioning among older adults by reducing distress surrounding social isolation and thereby promoting more adaptive coping. During a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, these practices acknowledge a shared suffering that may relieve loneliness and enhance belonging.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1899, "end": 1901, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2163, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2347, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2818, "end": 2820, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3016, "end": 3018, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3203, "end": 3206, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3207, "end": 3209, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3420, "end": 3422, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3709, "end": 3711, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3741, "end": 3743, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3780, "end": 3782, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1037, "end": 1045, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1450, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1987, "end": 1994, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "A Cognitive Behavioral Model of Social Isolation"}, {"text": "In addition to being an emotionally distressing state in itself, loneliness is associated with other negative emotional states, such as anxiety.

Social distancing is an important public health strategy for controlling the spread of the virus and minimizing its impact on the older adult population. It comes at a cost, however. Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for corona virus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention.

Most clinicians are not taught ways to reach out to people virtually and are unfamiliar with using only verbal communication to express ourselves and offer comfort. While clinicians may feel uncomfortable with this approach to providing psychotherapy, it is also true that older adults report high satisfaction with psychotherapy provided by telephone and demonstrate high retention rates. 47 Creating a Connections Plan may help clinicians new to providing psychotherapy remotely because it is feasible and easy to implement over the phone, taking techniques that we already utilize, but putting them together in a straight-forward way that all clinicians can implement. For important issues to consider and practical guidance related to providing telephone psychotherapy, we refer readers to papers by Brenes and colleagues 47 and Mozer and colleagues. 48 Another useful resource is a guide to implementing Safety Planning with older adults, which includes tips for motivating patients and managing issues such as vision impairment and cognitive impairment when creating a Safety Plan, which is a similar strategy to a Connections Plan. 27, 49 The cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness as presented here illustrates effective applications of patient-centered care by mental health clinicians highlighting the value of knowing patient values and preferences. In times of \u2017social distancing' access to health care professionals is also limited which, in turn, limits opportunities for practicing the skills and reinforcing the patient's adherence to the \u2017Connections Plan.' Expanding support for the patient's plan, as described in the case examples which enlisted family involvement, would increase the likelihood of successful implementation. In addition, teaching family members the principles of the cognitive behavioral model would similarly empower them to comfort and reassure the patient during times of distress. For patients with limited family support and who may have been isolated prior to COVID-19, clinicians will have fewer resources to draw upon when creating a Connections Plan. In those instances, clinicians may need to emphasize distress tolerance strategies and helping the patient find ways of feeling safe and comforted without other people. The title, \u2017Connections Plan' allows for many types of connections-with people, animals, nature, a higher purpose-and all of those connections have value. The importance of connections with people who are not close family and friends -\u2017weak or peripheral ties' in the social network-should not be discounted, as these connections are strongly linked with more positive mood in older adults. 50 Waving to neighbors, writing letters to individuals in nursing homes, or signing up for an intergenerational pen pal program, can be powerful ways to connect and improve mood.

It is important not to make assumptions about the types of social interactions or social relationships that are most meaningful or important to an older person.

His wife of 45 years still resides in their home and would visit several times a week before the pandemic. His children and grandchildren would also call regularly and visit occasionally. He misses the reassuring presence of his family, but when they visit it reminds him of all the activities they can no longer do together because of his illnesses and disability. When his family is not visiting, Mr. Y spends much of his time watching TV in his room or sleeping.Despite encouragement from family and staff, Mr. Y avoids socializing with other residents or engaging in recreational activities in the nursing home. Recently he is having more difficulty following conversations over the phone and remembering what he wants to say, which makes it harder to connect with loved ones. He is concerned that his dementia is progressing and he longs to return home and spend his days walking his dog, playing with his grandchildren, and going out to eat with his wife. When COVID-19 spreads to a nearby community, a social distancing protocol is put in place at the nursing facility where Mr. Y lives. The protocol includes restrictions on outside visitors, activities outside of the facility, and group activities within the facility. His family attempts to mitigate the impact of the restrictions by calling more frequently, but Mr. Y refuses to take their calls. He starts having difficulty sleeping at night and appears more restless and irritable during the day, sometimes yelling at staff and other residents. Mr. Y did not use the term -lonely\u2016 to describe his experience, but his thoughts, feelings, and actions demonstrate how loneliness and social isolation may present in long-term care settings. Despite frequent visits and calls from family, Mr. Y's thoughts focused on his loss of emotional connection with loved ones and concerns of further loss due to cognitive decline. He experienced feelings of disconnection, anxiety, and depression. His behaviors included avoidance of social and recreational activities, which increased his social isolation and reinforced his feelings of disconnection. In the context of social distancing due to COVID-19, Mr.Y began to experience heightened social isolation and anxiety that manifested in behavioral problems.To help Mr. Y address his social needs and concerns, a collaborative process was used to develop a \u2017Connections Plan' that would be feasible within the current restrictions and additional responsibilities placed on healthcare staff due to COVID-19 protocols. Mr. Y's clinician described the CBT model of loneliness and social isolation(Figure 1) to the treatment team and then to Mr. Y and his wife, and together they developed a modified version of the \u2017Connections Plan' inFigure 3. The plan was modified to emphasize behavioral strategies (i.e., behavioral activation) over cognitive strategies (i.e., cognitive restructuring), which may be beneficial for individuals with cognitive impairment. Mr. Y initially had difficulty identifying social activities that were meaningful for him, so the recreation therapist met with Mr. Y individually to engage in reminiscence around themes of work, leisure, and friends/family to clarify what was important to him in his social relationships. The social worker gathered additional information about recent changes in his relationships and amount of social activities from his wife. To address Mr. Y's resistance to phone calls, the recreation therapist asked him what was hard about talking on the phone and what most concerned him. Through this collaborative process, three activities were identified and integrated into his daily schedule.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "As with previous examples, a clinical assessment should seek to understand the causes of Ms. Z's feelings of isolation, her social values, and barriers to meeting those values.
