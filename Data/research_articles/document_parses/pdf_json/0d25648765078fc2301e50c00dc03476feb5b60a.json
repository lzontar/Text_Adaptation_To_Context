            "text": "The world is seeing a catastrophic pandemic of SARS-CoV2 or of the disease COVID-19, in first quarter of 21st century with the emergence of novel corona virus. After starting in Wuhan city of China in Dec'19 it has spread over 183 countries so far, with varying degree of severity and fatalities. Nearly 1.2 million of world population have been confirmed as cases of COVID-19 and above 66 thousand deaths were reported by April 4, 2020. 1 The intensity of pandemic varies from country to country and the worst affected ones are Italy, Spain and France regarding the fatality ratio. It is learnt that 40% of total global cases and 79.5% of total global deaths due to COVID-19 are reported in European region. 1,2 Regional statistics of World health organization depicts that Eastern Mediterranean region (EMRO) stands fourth in the rank of prevalence of confirmed cases of COVID-19 after Europe, Americas and Western pacific, with a total number of 66 thousand cases and 3592 deaths. Among EMRO countries, Iran contributes the highest proportion 88% of cases as compared to that of 3.7% cases recognized in the KSA. Correspondingly, 98% of deaths due to COVID-19 in EMRO region were documented in Iran. 1, 3 The Case fatality rate (CFR) would be a misleading indicator without knowing the complete natural course of the disease and the number of total cases due to limited diagnostic and research facilities at the moment. Nevertheless, case fatality rate in COVID-19 documented to be 3.4% as mean (in age >80 as high as 14.8%), as compared to 10% of SARS-CoV1 and 35% of MERS-CoV. 4, 5 In current scenario, nature of the virus and its ability to affect populations, is still unclear. But we should not forget the example of HIV/AIDS, Spanish flu and Hong Kong flu pandemics, where resurgence, mutation of virus, unusual trend, deceptive figures of pandemic and certain misconceptions further deteriorated the scenario and hampered with peoples' response to control strategies.",

Few asymptomatic cases were also identified in family clusters. It was evaluated that 81% of the cases were mild, 14% required oxygen therapy while 5% were critical with multiple organ failure and septic shock. 6 For its laboratory diagnosis, CDC has developed a new laboratory test kit, called as \"CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel.\" It is intended for use with upper and lower respiratory specimens collected from persons suspected of COVID-19. This test is said to be 70% sensitive. Till date no specific pharmacological therapy has been identified. Patients have been treated with symptomatic therapy 6 of Oxygen, antiviral preparations, while hydroxychloroquine also shows some promising results lately.",

Transmission can be studied by calculating basic reproduction number R 0 , rate of infection in household, schools or workplace, travel history of suspected cases, and outpatient reporting of cases. If R 0 is calculated less than 1, the pandemic is unlikely to occur, if 1 less likely and if more than 1 then a pandemic is certain. 7 The COVID-19 has R 0 of 1.4e 6.5, that is higher than of SARS. 4 The other indicator besides transmission rate, is severity of the pandemic, that can be studied by ratio of cases to hospitalization, ratio of deaths to hospitalization and ratio of Intensive care Unit admissions to total admissions. 8 It is imperative to identify pandemic severity index to tackle the situation accordingly. Pandemic severity index should be assessed in the early phase of the outbreak by taking into account transmissibility, seriousness of clinical course and impact of pandemic on health care and societies. 9 The pandemic severity Index is categorized as none [ Depending on COVID-19 overall mortality ratio it can be classified as having category 2 pandemic severity index.",
