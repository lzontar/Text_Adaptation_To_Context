            "text": "In the waning days of April 2020, reports from western Europe were heralding what appeared to be a new febrile pediatric entity that involved systemic hyperinflammation, multiorgan involvement, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, sometimes features reminiscent of Kawasaki disease (KD), and very prominent cardiogenic shock with impressive myocardial dysfunction. Several designations have been proposed for this syndrome including pediatric coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Many of these patients were exposed to someone known or suspected to have COVID-19. Most, but not all, of these patients tested positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and/or immunoglobulin (Ig) G and/or IgM antibody tosevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",

Six of the 8 children were of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity, 5/8 were males, and all were previously healthy. Prominent features were high fever, GI symptoms, and shock; there was a relative lack of respiratory symptoms; and 7/8 required mechanical ventilation for cardiovascular stabilization. All tested negative for SARS-2 on bronchoalveolar lavage or nasopharyngeal aspirates, but all 8 were reported to be positive for antibody to SARS-2. One child (who actually may have had KD) developed a giant coronary aneurysm, and 1 died after developing an arrhythmia with refractory shock that required ECMO and then suffered a large fatal cerebrovascular infarct. On echocardiography, others did not have coronary arterial enlargement. Laboratory studies included very impressive markers of inflammation, particularly elevated D-dimers, ferritin and triglycerides (highly suggestive of macrophage activation syndrome [MAS]), as well as very elevated cardiac enzymes and troponin and extremely high N-terminal-pro B-type Natriuetic Peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels. Most patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 2 gm/ kg) and aspirin, improved, and were discharged from the pediatric intensive care unit in 4-6 days.",

There is much speculation regarding the pathogenesis of MIS-C, particularly regarding its potential relationships to typical or incomplete KD, to a small subset of KD known as Kawasaki shock syndrome, to bacterial infection-triggered toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and to MAS. At this time, it appears likely that infection with pandemic SARS-2 serves as a delayed trigger for MIS-C, which seems to be a post-infectious inflammatory process, as suggested by its delay from peak community COVID-19 activity and by the frequent SARS-2 PCR negativity but antibody positivity, albeit with the important caveat that accuracy/validity of SARS-2 serologic testing is somewhat nonstandardized at this time.",

The KD attack rates in Japan, China, and other Asian countries are easily the highest in the world. However, MIS-C has not been seen in Asia despite the great frequency of COVID-19 in Asia.
