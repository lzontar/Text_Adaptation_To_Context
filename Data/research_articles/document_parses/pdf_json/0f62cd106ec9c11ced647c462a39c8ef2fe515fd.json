The regulatory, technical, and payment aspects of this new type of dental service modality are rapidly accelerating, bolstering dental providers' ability to test and utilise synchronous teledental and dental telehealth services. However, this setting poses unique challenges to building rapport with patients and communicating in a patient-centered fashion. Here, we offer five essential interpersonal considerations to synchronous teledental communication, which we have termed the SHARE approach.",

Most teledental transmissions are not in high definition, and this decreased visual capability can hamper a patient's ability to understand our words, especially in technical settings like dentistry. So slow down and annunciate clearly. You might think you sound strange, but it will be helpful to patients. Avoid jargon, instead using words that a patient will understand (e.g. cavities, not caries).",

Hold eye contact by looking at the camera While it may seem relatively obvious, eye contact in a teledental setting is achieved not by looking at the patient, but at the camera. Eye contact helps create a sense of empathy, building and strengthening a relationship strained by lack of physical presence. Speaking of presence, try to remain focused on your patient while you're talking to them. If you need to look at something else (like a chart) while your face is on the screen, verbally explain what you're doing so that it does not appear that you are checking your email.",

Open-ended questions allow the patient to share these critical pieces of information more freely. 'Tell me about the pain you've been having' allows the vital parts of that story and their treatment desires to emerge, much more so than 'Where does it hurt?'",
