In addition, virallike particles have been reported within endothelial cells but direct viral infection of endothelial cells is a matter of debate (Goldsmith et al Lancet in press). Another report (Ackermann et al NEJM 2020) on pulmonary autopsy specimens compared COVID-19 patients' findings with specimens of patients died of influenza H1N1. Besides common features of diffuse alveolar damage, COVID-19 infected patients showed distinctive histologic features of severe endothelial injury, intracellular endothelial SARS-CoV-2 virus, microangiopathy with intravascular thrombi and intussusceptive angiogenesis.Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are mature cells considered reliable markers of endothelial derangement. Healthy subjects carry low CEC counts, whereas it has been demonstrated that levels increase significantly in conditions associated with vascular damage. 2 CEC enumeration in peripheral blood using flow cytometry has been successfully used to correlate CEC titre and organ damage in ARDS 3 and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation related sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.4",
