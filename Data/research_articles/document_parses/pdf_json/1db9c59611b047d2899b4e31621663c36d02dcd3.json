The pressure to the health services worldwide has been unprecedented. The redeployment of staff and resources to treat more efficiently COVID-19 cases along with the need to reduce disease transmission has affected the field of electrophysiology among many others. Amendments to clinical pathways are obligatory in this perspective to continue to provide the necessary health services to the people who need them, although at the same time, infection control and prevention are not compromised by inadvertent disease transmission or unnecessary use of resources. We aim to provide a guide of the logistic aspects of electrophysiology procedures derived from our tertiary cardiac center during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

Cardiac electrophysiology is a field that has been readily and immensely affected, and the Heart Rhythm Society has produced a consensus document 4 regarding, among others, a classification of ablation procedures according to urgency. Moreover, NHS England has provided guidance regarding the management of cardiac patients including recommendations relevant to electrophysiology procedures. 5 Based on these 2 documents, catheter ablation procedures that are considered urgent or emergent are (1) ablation of ventricular tachycardia that cannot be controlled with medication and leads to hemodynamic compromise, (2) ablation of an incessant, hemodynamically significant, severely symptomatic tachycardia (SVT/atrial flutter) not responding to antiarrhythmic drugs, rate control, and/or cardioversion, and (3) ablation for preexcited atrial flutter with syncope or cardiac arrest.",

            "text": "Given that viral diseases can trigger arrhythmias via inflammatory processes and adrenergic activation, on many occasions, the patients requiring these procedures might be COVID-19 positive. Indeed, early reports suggest that COVID-19 can be complicated by arrhythmias 6, 7 and that severe cases show evidence of cardiac involvement. 8 The most prevalent mechanism is believed to be ischemia induced by the inflammation process, but also direct myocyte injury and myocarditis has been reported. 9,10 So, on many occasions, anesthetic support might be needed during an ablation procedure and guidance regarding anesthetic aspects of treating patients with COVID-19 has already been proposed. 11, 12 The type of personal protective equipment (PPE) required is determined by whether the patient having the procedure is positive/ suspected COVID-19 and whether the procedure is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. According to Public Health England intubation/extubation and related procedures, open suctioning of the respiratory tract, noninvasive ventilation, and high-flow nasal oxygen are considered aerosol-generating procedures, 13 so by default in such a case full PPE is recommended in a positive/suspected COVID-19 patient because, at a minimum, conscious sedation might be needed which may prompt the need for high-flow nasal oxygen. Full PPE comprises gloves, disposable fluid-repellent long-sleeve gown/coverall, filtering face piece class 3 respirator, and full-face shield or visor. 13 It is also noted in the same guidance document that \"Subject to local risk assessment, the same precautions apply for all patients regardless of case status in contexts of sustained COVID-19 transmission.\" Based on that and taking into consideration that (1) there might not be enough time for testing due to emergency conditions and (2) there is a considerable percentage of false-negative test results, we opted for full PPE in all ablation cases performed in the laboratory.",

This can be achieved for the inpatients by doing all the checks in the ICU/ward before the procedure or inside the laboratory bypassing any unnecessary staying in interim areas. Also, after the procedure, the recovery of the patient should be done in the laboratory or the ICU/ward. For patients needing general anesthesia, intubation and extubation are recommended to be performed in the ICU/ward to minimize aerosol generation and contamination of the laboratory which ideally should have a negative pressure ventilation system. For the same reason, intracardiac echocardiography is preferred over transesophageal echocardiogram depending on availability and operator expertise. Regarding the outpatients, separate designated areas should exist for confirmed/ suspected COVID-19 patients and confirmed negative COVID-19 patients and the target should be same-day discharge if possible. If hospitalization is needed, the patient should remain in the designated preoperation day case unit to reduce the transmission of the virus.",
