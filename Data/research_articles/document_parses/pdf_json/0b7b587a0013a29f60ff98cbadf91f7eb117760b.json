After 6 hours of infection, all control (infected but not phage-treated) mice were visibly ill, lethargic, and scruffy. The control group fatality rate was 56% (IP) and 52% (oral) within 36 hours. The stomachs and intestines of control mice contained high levels of bacteria (stomach, 1.0 \u00d7 10 4 CFU/g; intestine, 5.3 \u00d7 10 3 CFU/g) until 12 hours post-infection ( Figure 3 ). In contrast, phage treatment resulted in excellent protection in terms of all 4 criteria. The phage-treated mice appeared to be only slightly ill and were protected up to 92% (IP) and 84% (oral) from the lethal infection induced by CRS 09-17 (2.0 \u00d7 10 7 CFU) after the administration of a single dose of purified pVp-1 of 2.0 \u00d7 10 8 PFU (Figure 3 ). The stomach/intestine CFU and histopathological features were improved by phage treatment. In the IP treatment group, a decrease in stomach/intestine CFU was obtained with the increased phage titer at 12 hours post-infection, 1.7 \u00d7 10 2 / 3.7 \u00d7 10 2 CFU/g and 5.7 \u00d7 10 3 /2.3 \u00d7 10 4 PFU/g (Figure 3 ). In the oral treatment group, the maximum CFU and PFU values of the stomach/intestine, which were observed at experimental onset, gradually decreased (data not shown). In addition, the histopathological features demonstrated that the V. parahaemolyticus infection significantly damaged the intestinal tract as observed by the hematoxylin-eosin stain ( Figure 4C and 4D) but not in the gastric region (data not shown). Severe destruction of the histologic structure of the colon was accompanied by a thinning of the wall, enterohemorrhage, and loss of crypts in the mucosal layer ( Figure 4C and 4D) . However, treatment with phage ameliorated the histological damage in the colon. The histopathological examination of the colon of the phage-treated mice revealed a significant recovery in the destruction of the intestinal wall and crypts, hemorrhages, and inflammation after both IP and oral treatment ( Figure 4E and 4F ). This suggests that phage-treated animals showed strongly reduced infection severity and could survive a lethal bacterial challenge.",

            "text": "Based on the morphological analysis, pVp-1 was classified into the family Siphoviridae and demonstrated a broad host range. This differs from a prior finding that Siphoviridae phages are generally considered to have restricted host ranges [16] . The phage infected 74% (20/27) of all multiple-antibiotic-resistant V. parahaemolyticus strains used in this study, including the 2 pandemic strains CRS 09-17 and CRS 09-72. Interestingly, pVp-1 infected the V. parahaemolyticus clinical isolate CRS 09-17 from a patient with diarrhea, which represents a multiple-antibiotic-resistant new O3:K6 pandemic strain (tdh+, ORF8+, toxRS/new+) [4] . The results obtained from pVp-1 showed its lytic nature with a latent period and a large burst size. Full genome sequencing of pVp-1 identified no similarity match with lysogenic or phage integrase-related genes (considered as markers of temperate phages), indicating that it is a novel, newly isolated lytic phage [12] . This result emphasizes the potential of pVp-1 as a therapeutic agent, as described by Guti\u00e9rrez et al [11] , who regarded lytic phages as more suitable phages for therapy. Furthermore, the stability of pVp-1 over a wide range of pH (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) and temperature (20\u00b0C -37\u00b0C) clearly indicates that pVp-1 would be highly stable in the human body.",

We hypothesize that phage therapy can be useful, especially in epidemics caused by multiple-antibiotic-resistant pandemic strains. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of pVp-1, we used a mouse model of V. parahaemolyticus CRS 09-17. In the cell lysis test of pVp-1, the growth of CRS 09-17 was apparently inhibited after pVp-1 inoculations at MOIs of 1 and 10, although pVp-1 partially inhibited the bacterial growth at an MOI of 0.1.",

To apply pVp-1 at an MOI of 10 (CRS 09-17, 2.0 \u00d7 10 7 CFU per mouse), where the maximum effect of cell lysis was examined, kinetic tests were performed with pVp-1 at 2.0 \u00d7 10 8 PFU per mouse. Phage titers in the stomach as well as the intestine indicated that pVp-1 was maintained at higher concentrations in these 2 organs and could prevent V. parahaemolyticus infections. These findings suggest that pVp-1 might be efficacious for a prophylactic approach. In blood, pVp-1 reached a high titer within the first hour following IP injection. In contrast, no phage was detected until after 1 hour, and it took longer to reach a higher titer when it was administered orally. Moreover, the highest titer in each organ was also much higher in the IP route of administration compared with the oral route of administration. Therefore, we speculate that the IP route of administration would be the more suitable route.",

The current phage treatment revealed the unique advantage of phage therapy, that is, that the normal microbial flora can be preserved in contrast to antibiotic use, which may lead to secondary symptoms by the disruption of normal flora, as previously reported [5, [21] [22] [23] . In the present study, mice were treated with phage pVp-1 at 1 hour post-infection in order to induce complete infection by V. parahaemolyticus. However, the progression of disease in our model was extremely rapid, and the delayed treatment with phages resulted in decreased efficacy of protection [21] . Furthermore, even if the Vibrios and phages were administered to mice simultaneously, they may not come into contact until some time after injection [21] . In order to achieve a higher level of protection, administration soon after infection is required.",
