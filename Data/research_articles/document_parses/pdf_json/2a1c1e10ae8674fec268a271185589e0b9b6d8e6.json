An understanding of injury epidemiology in twenty-first century armed conflict is required to plan humanitarian trauma systems capable of responding to population needs. Methods We conducted a systematic search of databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, World Health Organization Catalog, Google Scholar) and grey literature repositories to identify records that described conflictrelated injuries sustained by civilians and local combatants since 2001. Results The search returned 3501 records. 49 reports representing conflicts in 18 countries were included in the analysis and described injuries of 58,578 patients. 79.3% of patients were male, and 34.7% were under age 18 years. Blast injury was the predominant mechanism (50.2%), and extremities were the most common anatomic region of injury (33.5%). The heterogeneity and lack of reporting of data elements prevented pooled analysis and limited the generalizability of the results. For example, data elements including measures of injury severity, resource utilization (ventilator support, transfusion, surgery), and outcomes other than mortality (disability, quality of life measures) were presented by fewer than 25% of reports. Conclusions Data describing the needs of civilians and local combatants injured during conflict are currently inadequate to inform the development of humanitarian trauma systems.

Whereas the decreased prevalence of thoracoabdominal trauma among US and NATO military service members has been attributed to improvements in body armor, the prevalence of extremity injuries among patients in our sample may be due to survivorship bias [15] . Given civilians' reliance on ad hoc transport with prolonged transport times, patients with significant thoracic and abdominopelvic trauma are unlikely to present alive for care. Previous reports, including data from civilian casualties treated during the 2016-2017 Mosul offensive, observed a similarly low (7%) rate of thoracic trauma [33] .
