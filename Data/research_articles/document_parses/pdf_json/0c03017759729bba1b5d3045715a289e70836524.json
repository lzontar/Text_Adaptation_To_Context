            "text": "Background: In human medicine, extremely high CRP (C-reactive protein) concentrations > 100 mg/l are indicators of bacterial infection and the need of antibiotic treatment. Similar decision limits for septic pneumonia are recommended for dogs but have not yet been evaluated for other organ systems. The aim of the retrospective study was to investigate the prevalence and evaluate dogs with CRP concentrations > 100 mg/l regarding the underlying etiology, the affected organ system and the prognostic significance. Results: Prevalence of CRP > 100 mg/l was investigated in dogs presented between 2014 and 2015 and was 12%. For evaluation of etiology and organ systems, dogs with CRP > 100 mg/l presented between 2014 and 2016 were enrolled. Dogs were classified into 4 main disease categories, i.e. inflammatory, neoplastic, tissue damage or \"diverse\". Diseases were assigned to the affected organ system. If an organ classification was not possible, dogs were classified as \"multiple\". 147 dogs with CRP 101-368 mg/l were included and classified into disease categories: 86/147 (59%) with inflammatory etiology (among these, 23/86 non-infectious, 44/86 infectious (33/44 bacterial), 19/ 86 inflammation non-classifiable), 31/147 (21%) tissue damage, 17/147 (12%) neoplastic (all malignant) and 13/147 (9%) diverse diseases. The affected organ systems included 57/147 (39%) multiple, 30/147 (20%) trauma, 21/147 (14%) gastrointestinal tract, 10/147 (7%) musculoskeletal system, 8/147 (5%) respiratory tract, 7/147 (5%) urinary/ reproductive tract, 6/147 (4%) skin/subcutis/ear, 6/147 (4%) central/peripheral nervous system and 2/147 (1%) heart. The disease group (p = 0.081) or organ system (p = 0.17) did not have an impact on CRP. Based on CRP, a detection of bacterial infection was not possible. The prognostic significance was investigated by determining the 3-months survival and hospitalization rate in a subgroup with known outcome. The 3-months survival rate was 46/73 (63%) while the majority 66/73 (90%) of patients was hospitalized. Conclusions: CRP concentrations > 100 mg/l are occasionally seen in a clinic population. They indicate a severe systemic disease of various etiologies with guarded prognosis. Extremely high CRP concentrations do not allow a conclusion of the underlying etiology or an identification of bacterial inflammation.",

            "text": "Acute phase proteins (APP) are sensitive markers that change their concentration as a reaction to a systemic inflammatory process [1] and are known to increase in response to infectious diseases [2] [3] [4] , immune mediated diseases [5] [6] [7] , neoplasia [8] [9] [10] and surgery [11] . APPs react more rapidly and with a shorter half-life period than classic markers of inflammation. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an important major APP in dogs, which increases within the first 8-24 h after an inflammatory stimulus [12, 13] and reaches up to 100-fold of the baseline levels [1] . This wide range permits a more detailed evaluation of an inflammatory process than leukocyte counts. CRP measurement is meanwhile widely available in veterinary medicine. According to state-of-the-art scientific research, the CRP range of healthy dogs is below 10-20 mg/l CRP [12, 14, 15] . Canine CRP value increases of up to > 900 mg/l are reported in extremely rare cases [13, 16] . Different cut-off values have been discussed as medical decision limits for human and canine CRP [17] . While there is no general definition, which medical decision limits should be utilized to classify an inflammation as low grade or moderate, there is a consent that CRP values above 100 mg/l indicate a high grade inflammation [18] [19] [20] . While current research provides at least some information on extreme leukocytosis in small animals [21, 22] , studies addressing extremely high CRP values in dogs are rare [3] . Scarce knowledge is available about the prevalence of CRP values above 100 mg/l in dogs. In humans, prevalence of CRP values > 100 m/l is ranging between 3 and 30% depending on the patient population [18, 23] .",

While bacterial infections have been reported in 55% (462/839) [18] to 78% (35/ 42) [20] of human patients with CRP concentrations > 100 mg/l, only 22% (33/149) of canine patients in our study fell into this category. In contrast to human beings, high CRP values above 100 mg/l were not able to discriminate between different disease etiologies in dogs in our data set. Our data confirm the theory that CRP cannot be used as a differentiation parameter to distinguish between infectious or even bacterial and non-infectious /non-bacterial diseases in dogs. Therefore, high CRP values are no indication for antibiotic treatment. Extremely high CRP values indicate a severe inflammation with acute phase reaction with various etiologies. The proportion of non-infectious diseases seen here (12%) is comparable to a recent study in humans (rheumatologic diseases~8%) [18] . In contrast, the proportion of neoplastic diseases (16%) is higher in our study compared to human medicine, where these patients only account for~5% [18] . A descriptive study on dogs with various diseases included a high proportion of patients with immune-mediated diseases or cancer among dogs with > 100 mg/l CRP which is in accordance with our results [19] .",

This could also be adopted to veterinary medicine, keeping in mind that especially non-infectious inflammations and neoplasia are also common etiologies. The fact that the diagnosis \"bacterial infection\" in our study was not always based on a positive microbiological finding might be seen as a limitation of the study. To our own experience and also according to recent research, microbiological analysis is helpful and important but not infallible. Negative results occur in patients with definite bacterial disease [29] . In human medicine, these are 25-60% of the samples [30] . It is acknowledged to start antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients based on the suspicion of a bacterial infection [31] . In cases of negative cultural results, it is up to the clinician's decision if antibiotics are necessary [31, 32] . On the other hand, positive microbiological results do not always prove an infection. There may be (pre) analytical problems such as contaminations or an overgrowth with bacteria that have not been the original pathogens. Furthermore, it is not always possible to take microbiological samples due to the anatomical region of inflammation or the critical state of the patient. Therefore, we took the conscious decision not only to include cases with (positive) bacteriological examination results in our study, but also to include cytological and histological findings as well as the clinical course of the patient. This is handled similarly in other studies [33] .",

This is in accordance with our study, where CRP values > 100 mg/l were only found in association with malignant and not benign neoplasia. Benign neoplasia is seldom described to cause major inflammatory reactions [9] and might be associated with ulceration in these cases [10, 34] . In human medicine, a proportion of about 25-40% of patients with malignant cancer has associated infectious or noninfectious mild to severe inflammation, which may be accompanied by a systemic acute phase reaction [35] [36] [37] . A similar explanation might be true for canine patients in general [34] and for the marked acute phase reaction seen in cancer patients in our study. Nevertheless, diagnostics concerning a possible secondary bacterial infection are indicated in patients with tumor and high CRP values [8, 20] .",

It is well known that traumatic events lead to tissue damage and induce an acute phase reaction within the first 24 h that subsides gradually until the point of time of suture removal [11, 38, 39] . The increase of CRP does not only depend on the degree of trauma [16, 39] but may also depend on the CRP value before surgery, the surgeon and analytical variations [29] . Another limitation of our study, however, might be the fact that bacterial infections could not always be excluded especially if surgery was performed in primarily \"non-sterile\" organs such as the gastrointestinal tract.

Nevertheless, it was obvious that some organ systems tend to be more frequently involved in marked inflammations. On the one hand, these are organ systems which are frequently exposed to bacteria (e.g. the gastrointestinal tract [19, 28, 40] ), but on the other hand these are also organ systems which are affected by non-infectious, often immune-mediated, diseases (e.g. the musculoskeletal system [41, 42] ). CRP analyses of patients with diseases of the reproductive organs are likely underrepresented in our study as they are primarily referred to the clinic for obstetrics. Interestingly, an organ system with frequent contact to microorganisms (respiratory tract), which is known to present with high CRP values [3, 28] in the case of bacterial infection, was underrepresented in our study. A reason for that could be that patients with bacterial pneumonia, seen in our university clinic, partly present with complicated disease progresses (e.g. pyothorax secondary to septic foreign body in the lung) or suffer from multiple diseases (aspiration pneumonia secondary to another disease, pneumonia due to immunosuppression) and were therefore not always classified as solely \"respiratory patients\". Given our results, the attempt to define a cut-off value to detect septic inflammation is only promising for organ systems rarely affected by immune mediated diseases and after ruling out malignant neoplasia with high probability as it has been done previously for the respiratory tract [3] .",

It appears to be logical that in a quite homogenous group with one disease etiology, higher CRP values indicate a higher severity of disease and worse prognosis. Furthermore, the diagnosis \"systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)\" is already an advanced state of disease, while in our mixed study population, dogs with different diseases and disease states are included. Additionally, it has to be taken into account that our study population was initially \"biased\" by the cut-off of 100 mg/l CRP, while other studies investigate the whole spectrum of CRP values [49] . In our study, evaluation of prognosis was only made in a subgroup of patients (patients with known prognosis according to the patient data system), potentially influencing the evaluation results as the clinic may lose contact due to different reasons (owner happy/unhappy, animal healthy/ dead, practical reasons).",

The high hospitalization rate of 90% seen here, can be explained with the fact that the majority of dogs was clinically severely ill. Nevertheless, there was no association of CRP and hospitalization. Similar findings have been reported for dogs with autoimmune hemolytic anemia or pyometra [7, 52] . The lack of impact of hospitalization on a single CRP result > 100 mg/l demonstrates that the absolute CRP value alone is not a definite prognostic marker but rather indicates a severe disease. Five of the seven (71%) non-hospitalized dogs were cancer patients. In these patients, the decision against hospitalization was probably not made because of a mild disease but due to the unfavorable prognosis. All five dogs were euthanized within the next two weeks.",

In our study, especially the pretreatment with anti-inflammatory or antibiotic agents is a limitation which might have lowered CRP concentrations. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that canine patients presented to our clinic still had an active disease process, even if pretreated. It has been shown that antibiotic pretreatment in dogs with > 24 h respiratory symptoms did not significantly affect the CRP concentration as well as pretreatment with glucocorticoids [3, 6] . Moreover, underlying conditions might have an impact on CRP concentrations. It is known that severe liver failure might lower the CRP value, but only little information is available in literature [53] .
