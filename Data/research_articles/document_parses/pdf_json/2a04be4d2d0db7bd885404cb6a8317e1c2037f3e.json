For the statistical model, we used demographic risk factor information for COVID-19 including age, gender, and underlying health status. For categorical age-related risk factor stratification a cut-off at 60 years was set following the definition that approximately 80% of COVID-19 related deaths have occurred among adults aged \u226560 years [18] [19] [20] . Previous reports also suggest that male gender and comorbidities such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease are risk factors for mortality for patients with COVID-19 [18] [19] [20] [21] , and thus were included in our model. Regarding CP treatment, the number of days between symptom onset and receipt of the first CP treatment was retrieved from all reported cases and included in the model. To estimate the safety of convalescent plasma for patients with COVID-19 all information about adverse events were retrieved from the studies included in this review. Finally, to estimate the efficacy of the CP intervention for COVID-19, the study endpoint was measured as the time to recovery in number of days since the CP treatment. Recovery was defined as the first consecutive negative result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (i.e. CT value higher than 37) from mouth/nasal swab of the patient. If viral RNA results were not reported, we used the hospital discharge time point as a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 clearance. For the multivariate regression model, the time to recovery variable was stratified into two categories; i) 1-7 days and ii) more than 7 days since CP treatment.
