A pseudotyping system with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles [the VSV G* system, in which the VSV-G gene is replaced by the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene] was reported to produce pseudotyped VSV incorporating envelope glycoproteins from RNA viruses. 1,2 This system is useful for studies of viral envelope glycoproteins due to the ability to grow at high titers in a variety of cell lines. Infection of target cells with pseudotyped VSV can be detected readily as GFP-positive cells within 16 hours postinfection (hpi) because of the high level of GFP expression in the VSV G* system. 2 Thus, pseudotyping of SARS-CoV-S protein using the VSV G* system may have advantages for studying the function of SARS-CoV-S protein as well as for developing a rapid system for examining neutralizing antibodies specific for SARS-CoV infection. In this report, we describe a rapid detection system for SARS-CoV-S protein-bearing VSV pseudotype infection. The effects of ACE2-binding peptides on SARS-CoV-S-mediated infection were investigated using this system.",

When the culture supernatants of the infected 293T cells were inoculated onto Vero E6 cells, a cell line commonly used for SARS-CoV propagation, only small numbers of GFP-expressing cells were observed (data not shown). These observations indicated that VSV pseudotype bearing the full-length SARS-CoV-S protein was not highly infectious. Next, we generated VSV pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-S protein in which the C-terminal 19 amino acids were truncated using the plasmid, pKS-SARS-St19. The plasmid, pKS-SARS-St19rev, was used as a negative control. 293T cells transfected with either pKS-SARS-St19 or pKS-SARS-St19rev were infected with VSV G*. After 24 h, the culture supernatants of infected cells were collected and inoculated onto Vero E6 cells. As shown in Figure 1 , the number of infectious units (IU) of pseudotyped VSV (5.0\u00d710 5 /ml), referred to as VSV-SARS-St19, obtained from 293T cells transfected with pKS-SARS-St19 was significantly higher than that of the negative control. As partial deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of the SARS-CoV-S protein allowed efficient incorporation into VSV particles and led to pseudotype generation at high titer, the intact cytoplasmic domain of SARS-CoV-S protein may interrupt proper assembly of the pseudotype particles.",

            "text": "VSV-SARS-St19 infection of Vero E6 cells was neutralized by anti-SARS-CoV antibody (data not shown). Furthermore, a recombinant human ACE2 ectodomain protein, soluble ACE2, 4 strongly affected VSV-SARS-St19 infection but did not affect infection of VSV-G-bearing pseudotype (VSV G*-G; Fig. 2A ). These results indicated that VSV-SARS-St19 infection is mediated by SARS-CoV-S protein in an ACE2-dependent manner. We then investigated whether a known ACE2-specific peptide inhibitor can compete with ACE2-mediated pseudotype virus infection. As shown in Figure 2B , pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with DX600, which has been shown to inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity, 5 inhibited VSV-SARS-St19 infection, while pretreatment with ACE2 peptide substrates, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, or desArg 9 -bradykinin, did not. Higher concentrations (>1.25 \u00b5M) of DX600 were required for 30-50% inhibition of VSV-SARS-St19 infection, indicating that this inhibition was weak (Fig. 2B ). Enzymatic activity is not required for ACE2 protein to act as a SARS-CoV receptor. 6 However, our results indicated that DX600 partially influenced the function of ACE2 as a SARS-CoV receptor. Further investigations, including inhibition studies with live SARS-CoV, are necessary to elucidate the efficacy of DX600. Our results suggested that ACE2-binding peptides can be used as specific inhibitors of SARS-CoV-S-mediated infection. Based on the results of neutralization experiments using anti-SARS-CoV antibody and soluble ACE2, we concluded that VSV-SARS-St19 infection of target cells is mediated by SARS-CoV-S protein. The assay system described here will be useful not only for developing a safe and rapid method to detect neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV but also for screening for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-S-mediated infection.",
