(B) Expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in WT pDCs transfected with Socs1-specific, or    scrambled siRNAs for 48h, followed by P. yoelii YM RNA or gDNA stimulation for 6 h. (C) IFN-\u03b2 protein of pDCs transfected with Socs1-specific or scrambled siRNAs, followed by P. yoelii YM RNA or gDNA stimulation for 24 h. (D) Silencing efficiency of Socs1 at 48 h after Socs1-specific siRNA delivery. C57BL/6 mice were injected intravenously with invivofectamine 3.0 (Invitrogen) mixed Socs1specific siRNA or scrambled siRNA at dosage of 5mg/kg. Spleen, lymph node, liver and peripheral blood were collect at 48 h after siRNA injection and subjected to QPCR analysis of SOCS1 expression.Meanwhile, pDCs were isolated from spleen with anti-mPDCA-1 beads (Miltenyi); T cells, B cells, macrophages, and cDCs were isolated from spleen with PE-staining (CD3 for T cells, CD19 for B cells,F4/80 for macrophages and CD11c for cDCs, respectively.), followed by PE positive selection kit (Stemcell). RNA were isolated and subjected to QPCR analysis of SOCS1 expression. (E) Experimental procedure of genetically deletion of Socs1 using CRISPR/CAS9 system in bone marrow for generating chimera mice. (F) Western blot analysis of Socs1 deficiency in bone marrow cells after transduction with Socs1-specific or scrambled sgRNA lentiviral supernatant for 48 h. (G) Serum amounts of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 in Socs1-specific or scramble sgRNA-treated mice at 24 h after P. yoelii YM infection. (H) Daily YM parasitemias and mortality rates of Socs1-specific or scrambled sgRNA-treated mice after P. yoelii YM infection. (I) A working model to explain SOCS1 inhibits Myd88 dependent type I IFN signaling and Jak1 dependent downstream signaling of type I IFN. (J) Serum amounts of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 in Socs1-specific or scramble siRNA-treated Myd88 -/mice at 24 h after P. yoelii YM infection.Data are plotted as the mean \u00b1 s.d. and are representative of three independent experiments. **P <0.01, ***P <0.001 vs. corresponding control.

Related to Figures 7 (A) Tmem173 gt mice were injected with clodronate (750 \u00b5g, intraperitoneally) and peripheral blood was collected at the indicated times and stained with CD11b, F4/80 for the flow cytometry analysis of macrophage percentage. Percentage of macrophage was compared to which in untreated mice. (B) The cell populations of pDC, cDC and macrophage were isolated from Mavs -/mice splenocytes at indicated times post YM infection by cell isolation kits, and then analyzed for cell-specific expression of P. yoelii 18S rRNA by PCR. (C) A working model to illustrate how DNA/RNA sensors (cGAS, MDA5 and TLR7) detect malaria infection to activate two type I IFN signaling pathways in pDCs and the stagespecific roles of pDCs, macrophages, cDCs and T/B cells in generating IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-induced immunity.Importantly, cGAS-STING and MDA5-MAVS-induced IRF3-dependent type I IFN signaling inhibits TLR7-MyD88-induced IRF7-dependent type IFN signaling pathway through upregulation of SOCS1 in WT pDCs in response to lethal P. yoelii YM infection. Deficiency in cGAS, STING, MDA5, MAVS or IRF3 markedly increases IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 production at the early stage of infection (24 h) in deficient pDCs in response to lethal P. yoelii YM infection. Data are plotted as the mean \u00b1 s.d. and are representative of three independent experiments. **P <0.01, ***P <0.001 vs. corresponding control. NS, not significant. \u2020 denotes mouse death.",
