Therefore it is the responsibility of the physician to use appropriate triggers for blood component therapy. 2. ABO and the Rh systems are the most important in the majority of blood transfusions, although human red cell membranes contain as many as 300 different antigenic determinants. 3. Indication for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is the need to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity. 4. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends avoiding HES in critically ill adult patients and septic patients requiring ICU care. 5. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is currently the leading cause of transfusion-related death. Clinical presentation of TRALI may be indistinguishable from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is characterized by acute onset, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia without evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF).",

The most common cause and indication for administration of blood components is acute surgical blood loss. In such a situation, transfusion of blood products can be lifesaving, however, it is not risk free. Therefore it is the responsibility of the physician to use appropriate triggers for blood component therapy. When there is clinical evidence of a deficiency in oxygen-carrying capacity, red cell transfusion should be considered; and if clinically significant coagulopathy is present, transfusion of hemostatic blood product should be considered. There are no mandatory thresholds for the transfusion; the clinician should take into consideration the patient's medical condition, the surgical procedure, symptoms, and the rate of blood loss when deciding if and when to start blood therapy. Although transfusion of whole blood is still used in certain clinical circumstances, blood components are transfused more often to correct specific deficiencies. The primary advantage of component therapy is that only the needed, specific fraction of the blood is administered, allowing several patients to benefit from 1 donation and administration of unnecessary or unneeded components is avoided. In addition, separation of the whole blood into components permits each to be stored under optimal conditions to enhance and preserve efficacy. The primary disadvantage of component therapy is encountered in treating patients with massive blood loss requiring massive transfusion, since these patients would benefit from whole blood to restore oxygen carrying capacity as well as hemostatic function. Multiple components are more expensive and more difficult to transfuse in such situations as compared to whole blood, and exposure to various complications of transfusion can be increased as the number of donor exposures increases.",

The patient's RBCs are also tested with anti-D for the presence (Rh positive) or absence (Rh negative) of the D antigen. Also, the patient's plasma is screened for the presence of unexpected antibodies by incubating it with 2 selected screening cells that contain all of the critical non-ABO antigens using an antihuman globulin (AHG) technique (indirect antiglobulin test or Coombs test). If an antibody is detected in the patient's plasma, the screen is considered positive. ABO group, Rh type, and antibody detection screening take about 45 min to perform. If the antibody screen is negative and the patient has no history of detected antibodies, the patient may receive RBCs that are tested for ABO compatibility by performing an immediate spin crossmatch or an electronic/computer crossmatch. ABO-and Rh-compatible blood is selected from the inventory and issued within 5-10 min. If the antibody screen is positive, the unexpected antibody or antibodies must first be identified before antigen negative-compatible RBC units can be found and then crossmatched-all of which usually takes several hours [1] .",

One unit of apheresis platelets or a pool of 4-6 whole bloodplatelets (derived from 4-6 donors) increases the platelet count by approximately 3-5 \u00d7 10 10 /L in the average adult. For pediatric patients, a dose of 10 ml/kg or 1 unit of platelets/10 kg will generally increase the platelet count to adequate levels. Factors to consider for the transfusion of platelets for counts between 5 and 10 \u00d7 10 10 /L are the type of surgery, extent of actual blood loss or microvascular bleeding, presence of potent antiplatelet medications (e.g., clopidogrel, IIb/IIIa antagonists, etc.) and disorders, such as uremia, known to affect platelet function and coagulation. Operations at closed sites (e.g., neuro or ophthalmic surgery) usually require increasing the platelet count 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L in order to ensure adequate hemostasis. Surgical procedures associated with insignificant blood loss may be undertaken in patients with platelet counts less than 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L. The platelet count alone does not guarantee adequate platelet function and platelet transfusion may be indicated, even above 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L count, if platelet dysfunction is suspected and/or there is a recent history of taking aspirin or other more potent or longer halflife platelet-inhibiting drugs (e.g., clopidogrel). Potent agents such as glycoprotein IIb/IIIb antagonists may require 2 or more apheresis platelet units to achieve normal hemostasis while effects of some other agents (e.g., clopidogrel) have not consistently been shown to be reversed with platelets. Whole blood coagulation tests such as thromboelastography or thromboelastometry testing can identify platelet dysfunction more precisely. The prophylactic administration of platelets is not recommended in patients with chronic thrombocytopenia caused by increased platelet destruction (e.g., idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) and, in fact, may be ineffective in a substantial percentage of these patients [3] .",

TACO has been implicated in 2-27% of the transfusion-related fatalities reported to the FDA, making it the second leading cause of transfusion-related death after TRALI. The actual incidence of perioperative TACO remains poorly defined and is likely much greater than that currently reported in other patient populations. Not only does this failure to appreciate TACO events contribute to our incomplete understanding of TACO epidemiology, but it may also result in suboptimal care delivery and unfavorable outcomes for patients.",

Among the immunocompromised patients at risk are individuals with congenital cell-mediated immunodeficiencies or Hodgkin's disease, recipients of bone marrow transplants, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

Numerous retrospective reports have suggested an increased incidence of postoperative infection and earlier recurrence of resected malignancies in transfused patients, but the same notion has not been confirmed by the available controlled trials. Critical evaluation of the reports has led some investigators to question whether transfusion causes these deleterious effects or whether the adverse effects are related to factors such as the need for transfusion of blood products. The donor leukocytes are the prime suspect in immunomodulation, and it has been indicated that leukoreduction may decrease postoperative infections in certain patient groups especially those undergoing cardiac surgery [14] .",

TRIM has been associated with alterations in immune function in allogeneic transfusion recipients, including: decreased helper to suppressor T-lymphocyte ratio, decreased NK cell function, defective antigen presentation, and reduction in cellmediated immunity [14] .

All platelet products should be tested for bacterial contamination prior to transfusion. 6. A. Cryoprecipitate is used primarily to augment fibrinogen levels depleted because of massive hemorrhage or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Rarely, it is used for the treatment of congenital or acquired Factor XIII deficiency. For fibrinogen replacement therapy, one unit of cryoprecipitate per 10 kg body weight increases plasma fibrinogen by approximately 50-70 mg/ dL in the absence of continued consumption or massive bleeding. The minimum hemostatic level of fibrinogen is less than or equal to 80-100 mg/ dL, but many experts regard that minimal level as too low. The national guidelines in Germany and Austria recommend higher levels of 150-200 mg/ dL in concordance with the Task Force of Advanced Bleeding Care in trauma and the European recommendations in perioperative bleeding. Because cryoprecipitate does not contain Factor V, it should not be the sole replacement therapy for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), which is almost always associated with a variety of factor deficiencies and thrombocytopenia. Hence, fresh frozen plasma also needs to be administered along with platelet concentrates in those settings where a coagulopathy secondary to DIC is likely occurring. 7. D. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends avoiding hydroxyethyl starch (HES) in septic patients requiring the intensive care unit. Evidence suggests that the use of HES in critically ill patients (including septic patients) increases the chance of renal injury and the requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT) when compared to crystalloids. This effect has also been observed in patients with sepsis requiring critical care and has also been found to increase mortality irrespective of the need for RRT. 8. D. Complications of transfusion include febrile reactions, allergic and anaphylactic reactions, and bacterial contamination: 5 Fever is associated with several types of transfusion reactions and may be the first indication of either a hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR) or administration of a bacterially contaminated blood component. In general transfusion should be stopped and the cause investigated when a rise in temperature of 1 \u00b0C or greater develops in association with blood transfusion and is not explained by the patient's clinical condition.",

The antigen-antibody interaction takes place on the surface of the cells, activating them and causing release of various mediators of anaphylaxis (leukotriennes, histamine, bradykinin) that cause the signs and symptoms characteristic of the reactions. The severity ranges from mild urticaria to bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, severe hypotension, and possibly death. 5 Bacteria present in stored blood can grow and may produce toxins. Contamination during collection, processing or storage is possible but is most likely to occur at the time of phlebotomy or if the donor has bacteremia associated with unrecognized infection. Administration of a bacterially contaminated blood component may result in fever, tachycardia, hypotension, chills, vomiting, and diarrhea. In some patients septic shock, oliguria and DIC can develop. Since platelets are stored at room temperature which facilitates bacterial growth, bacteremia is forty times more frequent following platelet administration than transfusion of refrigerated components. 9. A. At a death rate of 30-40 deaths per million units transfused, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is currently the leading cause of transfusion-related death. It can occur after the transfusion of a variety of blood components such as red blood cells, plateletsm and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) but is most often seen after transfusion of the plasma-containing blood components such as FFP and platelets. Clinical presentation of TRALI, in its severe form is indistinguishable from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is characterized by acute onset (within minutes to 1-2 h after transfusion), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxia without evidence of congestive heart failure. 10. D. Anuria is not among the diagnostic criteria for transfusion-related circulatory overload (TACO).

            "text": "sepsis is the most frequent cause of death from transfusion-transmitted infections and the second most common cause of transfusion related death (20-30 deaths/million units transfused) as reported to the FDA, representing 17-22% of all reported fatalities (1 per 50,000-500,000 units platelets and 1 per 8000,000 red cell units.) The most common bacteria implicated in sepsis from red blood cells are Yersinia enterocolitica (46%), Pseudomonas spp. (25%) and Serratia spp. (11%). The common organisms identified in platelet units implicated in transfusion-associated sepsis include Staphylococcus spp. (42%), Streptococcus spp.",

            "text": "v Answers 1. B. Increased exposure to multiple donors is not an advantage of whole blood transfusion. Exposure to various complications of transfusion can be increased as the number of donor exposures increases. 2. A. A type and screen (T&S) consists of a group of tests performed on a patient's blood specimen, It includes typing the patient's red cells for ABO and Rh blood groups and screening the patient's plasma or serum for the presence of unexpected non-ABO antibodies. ABO group, Rh type and antibody detection screening take approximately 45 min to perform. If the antibody screen is negative and the patient has no past history of unexpected antibodies, the patient may receive red blood cells (RBCs) that are tested for ABO compatibility by performing an immediate spin crossmatch or an electronic/computer crossmatch. ABO-and Rh-compatible blood is selected from the inventory and issued within 5-10 min following immediate spin crossmatch or computer/electronic crossmatch. If the antibody screen is positive, the unexpected antibody or antibodies must first be identified before antigen negative-compatible RBC units can be found and then crossmatched-all of which usually takes several hours. 3. B. Transfusion of red blood cells is only indicated for raising the oxygen-carrying capacity, although RBCs also provide volume when given to patients acutely hemorrhaging. 4. D. Massive transfusion of red blood cells can result in hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypothermia: 5 Hyperkalemia -As blood ages, the extracellular concentration of potassium steadily increases. The amount of extracellular potassium transfused with each unit is usually less than 4 mEq per unit transfused. However, hyperkalemia can develop regardless of the age of the blood when transfusion rates exceed 100 mL/min. 5 Hypocalcemia -Transfusion of large volumes of blood or blood products results in hypocalcemia due to calcium binding by the citrate pre servative. Clinically significant hypocalcemia, causing cardiac depression, usually occurs when the transfusion rate exceeds 1 unit every 5 min. In such situations intravenous calcium preparations should be administered to restore normal calcium level. Also because citrate is metabolized in the liver, patients with hepatic disease or dysfunction may demonstrate hypocalcemia and require calcium infusion during massive transfusion. 5 Hypothermia -Hypothermia (temperatures below 35 \u00b0C) is likely to occur during massive transfusion therefore all blood products and intravenous fluids should be warmed to normal body temperature. The potential effects of hypothermia include ventricular dysrhythmias, shivering, increased oxygen consumption, cardiac arrest and citrate toxicity secondary to reduced metabolism of citrate and lactate; ventricular arrhythmias progressing to fibrillation often occur at temperatures close to 30 \u00b0C. Hypothermia also contributes to coagulopathy: it causes a reversible platelet dysfunction, activity of the coagulation factors and enhances fibrinolysis. Hypothermia also prevents the activation of platelets via traction on the glycoprotein Ib/IX/V complex by von Willebrand factor. In clinical practice the contribution of hypothermia to coagulopathy may be overlooked because coagulation testing is usually performed at 37 \u00b0C. Warming of blood, as well as all other fluids during massive transfusion is essential to help prevent systemic hypothermia.",
