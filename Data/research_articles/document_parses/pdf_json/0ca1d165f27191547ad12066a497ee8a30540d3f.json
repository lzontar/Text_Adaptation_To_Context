In this study, we investigated the potential of lysozyme-treated Enterococcus faecalis FK-23 (LFK) to prevent influenza in influenza virus-infected mice. C57BL/6N mice were orally administered LFK and intranasally infected with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) at lethal doses. After infection with influenza A virus, the survival rate of the LFK-administered mice was significantly higher than that of saline-administered mice. Staining of lung sections with hematoxylin-eosin, and cell counts of lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed that oral administration of LFK suppressed the excessive infiltration of leukocytes into the lung after viral infection. Extravasation assay revealed that the arrest was mediated by modulation of pulmonary alveolar-capillary permeability. Expression levels of genes involved in matrix degradation, which are correlated with vascular permeability, were downregulated in LFK-administered mice. These findings suggest that stabilizing the integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier by the administration of LFK improves survival rate.",

According to reports issued by the World Health Organization, approximately 5-15% of the world's population is annually infected with influenza A virus, and 250, 000-500, 000 of these infected patients die each year. Annual immunization is the primary means to protect from influenza virus infection, but this vaccination strategy can be limited by the production time (Boltz et al. 2010) . In addition to the vaccination strategy, antiviral therapy is useful to control the spread of influenza. Two classes of antiviral drugs (M2-ion channel inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors) have been approved for the prevention and treatment of influenza (Boltz et al. 2010; van der Vries et al. 2011) . However, the effectiveness of these antiviral agents may be limited by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses (van der Vries et al. 2011) .",

These lung injuries directly correlate with influenza-associated morbidity and mortality because of the impairment of gas exchange and respiratory functions. ARDS is characterized by an increase in the permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier, which is formed by the microvascular endothelium and the alveolar epithelium, leading to an influx of fluid and leukocytes into the alveolar airspace across both the endothelium and the epithelium (Nunes 2005) . ALI and ARDS were leading causes of death following infections with pandemic 2009 H1N1 and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses (Perrone et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2012b) .",

These bacterial administrations help to enhance host's immune response that causes the reduction of the viral replication efficiency and/or upregulation of cytokine expression. Previously, we reported that the water-soluble fraction of lysozymetreated lactic acid bacterium Enterococcus faecalis FK-23 (LFK) reduces the mortality associated with influenza A virus infections (Kondoh et al. 2012) . However, the mechanism underlying the anti-influenza effect of LFK remains unclear. We previously reported that the oral administration of LFK attenuates the eosinophil influx into the upper airway in a murine allergic model (Zhu et al. 2012 ) and the inflammatory cell influx into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in a murine asthmatic model (Zhang et al. 2012a ). These results implied the possibility of anti-inflammatory effect of LFK during influenza virus infection. In this study, we demonstrate that the administration of LFK reduces mortality after H1N1 viral infection and suppresses the excessive influx of leukocytes, which cause inflammatory reactions, into lungs via modulation of the alveolarcapillary permeability.",

In this experiment, the LFK dose was fixed at 15 mg per mouse as previous report in which water-soluble fraction of LFK suspension (15 mg per mouse) was administered to mice (Kondoh et al. 2012) . However, in this experiment, LFK suspension rather than water-soluble fraction of LFK was administered for comprehensive understanding of the mechanism for prevention of influenza by LFK. As shown in Figure 1B , 16% of mice in the control group, which were administered saline orally, survived for 17 days post-infection. In contrast, 45% of mice administered LFK orally survived after infection.

Unlike in the control group, the number of these cells in the LFK-administered group was significantly suppressed at DPI-5, DPI-7, and DPI-10 ( Figure 2B ).

The change in alveolar-capillary permeability was assessed by monitoring the extravasation of Evans blue dye into the BALF. As shown in Figure 4A , increases in virus-induced Evans blue accumulation were suppressed at DPI-7 in the LFK-administered mice.

Therefore, we investigated the mRNA expression level of MMPs in the lung during the course of viral infection. MMP-7 expression following viral infection was suppressed in the LFKadministered group at DPI-7 ( Figure 4B ).

We previously reported that oral administration of the soluble components of LFK, lysozyme-treated lactic acid bacteria E. faecalis FK-23, has an anti-influenza effect by upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in lung (Kondoh et al. 2012) . However, administration of the LFK suspension did not markedly upregulate IL-10 expression in this study ( Figure 3A ). This discrepancy could be due to the differences in composition between administered samples. In this report, LFK suspension was administered to mice, while the supernatant of LFK suspension after centrifuge was used in the previous report (Kondoh et al. 2012) . The present study demonstrated that LFK suspension has the ability to neither repress the viral replication, nor enhance the immune system in the lungs (Figures 1C,  3 , and Additional file 3: Figure S3 ).

In Figure S2 , we demonstrated that oral administration of LFK increases the number of type II pneumocytes, which act as alveolar epithelial stem cells (Fehrenbach 2001 ). However, further experiments, such as immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies against proliferation marker and mitogen, are required to clear how the proliferation is induced by LFK. Influenza virus infection against type II pneumocyte causes damage to the alveolar epithelial cells and/or the cell death (Matute-Bello et al. 2001; van Riel et al. 2007; Loosli et al. 1975) . The damage and/or loss result in disturbances in fluidity at the alveolar-capillary border, which is associated with gas exchange inefficiency and pulmonary vascular permeability (Mura et al. 2010; Ware and Matthay 2000; Matute-Bello et al. 2001 ). Therefore, the increase in the number of type II pneumocytes in the LFK-administered group suggests that LFK might have the effect of improving respiratory function and epithelial barrier function by the proliferation and/or differentiation of type II pneumocyte during viral infection. Another possibility is that the increase in the number of type II pneumocytes might cause the lower multiplicity of the virus in the virus-infected pneumocyte, which leads to the repression of cell death of type II pneumocyte and successive vascular permeability. However, further analysis of the induction of cell death, proliferation, and differentiation in the type II pneumocyte is required to unmask the role of the increased pneumocyte in LFK-administered mice during the influenza virus infection.",

Increased influx of leukocytes into alveolar space occurs after viral infection, and leukocyte extravasation from the blood to the inflamed tissue is a controlled process involving rolling, adhesion, and migration (Weber et al. 2007) . While CXCL4 shows no chemotactic activity against leukocytes, CXCL4 enhances monocyte adhesion to the endothelium and neutrophil extravasation to the inflamed lung via heterophilic interaction with CCL5 (Grommes et al. 2012; von Hundelshausen et al. 2005; Kasper and Petersen 2011) . Therefore, our results suggest that the suppression of leukocyte migration into the lung by the administration of LFK is partially mediated by the downregulation of CXCL4 expression.",

MMP-7 is reported to degrade not only VE-cadherin but also E-cadherin, which are major components of endothelial and epithelial adherens junctions, respectively (McGuire et al. 2003; Ichikawa et al. 2006) . These adherens junctions act as gatekeepers for the passage of leukocytes during inflammation. Furthermore, stabilization of vascular barrier integrity by upregulating the expression of the VE-cadherin mRNA reduces mortality after H5N1 viral infection and suppresses leukocyte influx into the lung (London et al. 2010) . Therefore, our results suggest that downregulation of the expressions of MMP-7 and other MMPs by LFK attenuates not only the breakdown of adherens junctions of alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cells, but also degradation of the vascular basement membrane and extracellular matrices.

After centrifugation, cells were treated with lysis buffer (BD Biosciences, Franklin lakes, USA) according to manufacture's instruction. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells were collected using a 24G catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) by insertion of PBS from the trachea. Number of lung and BALF cells was counted using a Neubauer hemocytometer (Erma, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody 2.4G2, and stained with FITCconjugated anti-CD3e (BD Biosciences, clone 145-2C11) for T-cell (CD3e + ) analysis, with FITC-CD11b (BD Biosciences, clone MI/70) and PE-Ly6G (BD Biosciences, clone 1A8) for neutrophils (CD11b high Ly6G high ) and monocytes (CD11b high Ly6G med ) analyses, with FITC-CD49b (BD Biosciences, clone DX5) for NK cells (CD49b + ) analysis, with FITC-B220 (Biolegend, clone RA3-6B2) for B cells (B220 + ) analysis, or with APC-CD11c (Biolegend, clone N418) and PE/Cy7-F4/80 (Biolegend, clone BM8) for dendritic cell (CD11c + F4/80 -) and macrophages (F4/80 + ) analyses.

In brief, total RNA was extracted from whole lung homogenates using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and Micro smash (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan), and then treated with DNase I (Takara bio, Otsu, Japan). The cDNA was synthesized using oligo dT20 primers (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), random primers (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Each procedure was performed according to the manufacture's instructions. Real time PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara bio, Otsu, Japan) with the MX3000P real time PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). Cycling conditions were used as: 95\u00b0C for 10 sec to activate DNA polymerase, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 sec and 60\u00b0C for 30 sec. Expression levels of each mRNA were represented as relative expression amounts, which were normalized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).",
