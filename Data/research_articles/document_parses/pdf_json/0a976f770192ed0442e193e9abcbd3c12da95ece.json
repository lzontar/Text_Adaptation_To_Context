The Board further recommended that all future patients with Ebola virus disease at the study sites should be randomised in an extension phase to receive either mAb114 or REGN-EB3, while terminating the remdesivir experimental and ZMapp control groups. 11 The PALM study results, published in 2019, support a statistically significant survival benefit in patients treated with mAb114 or REGN-EB3, with the greatest benefit seen in patients receiving early therapy or those with higher Ebola virus RT-PCR nucleoprotein gene (NP) cycle threshold (CT) values (an inverse proxy for higher Ebola virus load) at admission. 1 The PALM effort represents a landmark achievement in the development of Ebola virus disease medical countermeasures, with the study team conducting a rigorous, well controlled study in a historically difficult outbreak setting, made even more challenging by armed conflict and instability. 12 For the first time since the discovery of Ebola virus in 1976, 13-15 clinical outcomes of patients with Ebola virus disease arriving at treatment centres in DR Congo were shown to be improved by particular therapeutic agents beyond the likely (but unproven) benefits of optimised supportive patient care (oSOC) alone. In the PALM study control group, the 28-day CFR in patients treated with oSOC plus ZMapp (a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies [mAbs] preven ting Ebola virus particle cell entry) 7 was 50% (84 of 169), which was statistically similar to the 53% (93 of 175)",

Additionally, outside the scope of acute disease, broader questions of the role of therapeutic intervention in the human-filoviral interaction still need to be considered. Regarding the filovirus-specific human therapeutic portfolio, key areas for attention are immediately apparent: (1) more effective strategies for individuals with severe disease at highest risk of death, (2) therapeutic penetration and combination therapy to reduce risk of relapse from immune-privileged sites and prevention or treatment of viral persistence, (3) consid eration of the interaction between vaccination and therapeutic strategies for post-exposure prophylaxis, and (4) therapeutic breadth.

Although the survival benefits for mAb114 and REGN-EB3 versus ZMapp (and by inference, remsdesivir) were maintained in this subset, the absolute CFRs remained unacceptably high (CFR was 70% with mAb114 and 64% with REGN-EB3) even with the most effective therapeutics. The contribution of viral load to risk of death is likely to be a continuous (ie, non-binary) variable; the frequency of poor outcomes is probably even higher in patients presenting with the highest viral loads. In these highest-risk patients, who often also presented late into illness with severe multiorgan dysfunction or failure, further improvement of outcomes will require considerable effort to improve filovirus-specific therapeutics and supportive care approaches. There is an urgent need to develop more effective, efficient strategies than are currently available, including the provision of moni toring and critical care in resourceconstrained settings.",

Detailed characterisations of the timing and progression of the disease in this model have shown that many of the key disease signs observed in human patients can be recapitulated, although at an accelerated pace. 19 Preclinical evaluation of therapeutics has been based on the initiation of treatment at the time of virus exposure or shortly after disease signs were observed. No published studies have described the efficacy of treatments initiated at later timepoints to animals with severe disease. Published landmark studies thus far have described the administration of candidate medical countermeasures only as late as 4-5 days after viral exposure. 2-5,7, 16, 17 Pre clinical studies might, therefore, overestimate the effects of a given agent in patients with advanced disease.",

Notably, study patients with Ebola virus disease did not seek medical help until an average of 5\u00b75 days after the onset of symptoms, often deep into illness and already with multi-organ dysfunction. An addition of this prolonged symptomatic period (5\u00b75 days) onto even a conservative estimate of the typical human incubation period (6-10 days) suggests that clinical intervention (with medical countermeasures or supportive care) are frequently only applied 11-12 days after the likely Ebola virus exposure. This timeframe is in stark contrast to the preclinical NHP benchmark to receive clinical intervention 4-5 days after viral exp osure, routinely referred to as a so-called success. 1 This delay might reflect a limitation in the NHP model in assessing drug efficacy in severe disease. Clearly, effective therapeutic strategies for these highest-risk patients are needed that address not only viral replication but also amelioration of systemic inflammatory response and organ failure.",

These include improving potency (neutralisation and antibody Fc region effector function), drug delivery, and therapeutic half-life in disease states. Potential synergies from combined administration of an mAb-based product with a mechanistically independent small molecule might improve early outcomes as well as subsequent viral clearance from extravascular Personal View tissue compartments in the recovery phase. mAb-based therapies are proposed to exert their antiviral effects by binding and neutralising virus particles present in circulation, thus inhibiting cell entry, and by sequestering viral products such as sGP, a secreted non-structural Ebola virus glycoprotein. 20 However, reports of human Ebola virus disease cases in Africa reveal plasma viral RNA concentrations of 10\u2074-10\u2078 genome equivalents per mL at the time of patient admission into studies. 9 With such high titres of circulating virus particles, many cells in multiple organs are probably already infected at treatment initiation, and a substantive effect of mAb treatments in infected cells is unlikely. Because small-molecule antivirals could penetrate cellular membranes to inhibit viral replication, administration in combination with mAbs might protect both infected and uninfected cells. Such a combination might help reduce viral titres, clear the virus from immune-privileged sites, and potentially decrease the likelihood of treatment-escape mutants. [21] [22] [23] [24] Anecdotally, the first newborn survivor of perinatal Ebola virus transmission received experimental ZMapp and remdesivir in western Africa (as defined by the UN Geoscheme) in 2016. 25 To date, no published studies have described the efficacy of combination mAb and small-molecule treatment regimens in humans or even NHP models. This absence of research is due in part to difficulties in showing synergy in existing NHP models, as well as proprietary barriers to undertaking combination studies. At a minimum, however, proof-of-concept studies showing the non-interference and safety of combining mAb-based and appropriate small molecules are urgently needed to lend first-do-no-harm confidence to clinicians and researchers at the bedside. In addition to lethality, secondary endpoints of interest in both NHPs and humans include the differential effect of combination therapy on viral decay kinetics, development of treatment-emergent resistance, severity of organ dysfunction, seeding of immuneprivileged tissues and viral per sistence, and downstream clinical sequelae in Ebola virus disease survivors (as mentioned in the following section).",

As appropriate antibiotic therapy is necessary but far from sufficient in patients with sepsis related to bacterial infection, the degree of organ dysfunction at admission in the PALM data suggests that effective filovirus-specific therapeutics cannot be uncoupled from requisite supp ortive care and will require coordinated development in both fields. Indeed, future combinations in selected patients might also include strategies targeting the host response that might mitigate immunopathology without compromising effective immunity; specific immunomodulation and general optimisation of supportive care could open and extend therapeutic windows both for mAb-based and small-molecule drugs that otherwise appear less effective.",

The understanding of Ebola virus disease-associated sequelae continues to develop as more careful attention is paid to increasing numbers of Ebola virus disease survivors who have made near-term, 26 medium-term, 27 and long-term 28, 29 obser vational studies feasible, building on case reports 30 derived from earlier outbreaks, including the 1995 Ebola virus disease outbreak in Zaire (now DR Congo). [31] [32] [33] Survivors have reported a range of sequelae, colloquially referred to as post-Ebola (virus disease) syndrome, 34 which manifest as mild, moderate, or severe complications within a few weeks of discharge and which could last for years. [26] [27] [28] During acute Ebola virus disease, Ebola virus might seed immune-privileged tissues, including the brain, eyes, and testes, 35 leading to viral persistence potentially consequential both for the individual survivorie, recrudescent organ-specific inflammatory syn dromes (eg, meningoencephalitis, uveitis)-as well as for the public-ie, the risk of person-to-person transmission and reignition of outbreaks. Ebola virus RNA has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid 36-38 during acute illness, 36, 39 in the weeks shortly after serum Ebola virus clearance, 37 and most notably 9 months after discharge in an Ebola virus disease survivor with severe meningoencephalitis. 38 More than 2 months after clear ance of viraemia and recovery, persistent viable Ebola virus has been detected in the aqueous humour of a survivor with severe sight-threatening unilateral panuveitis. 40 Ebola virus and Ebola virus RNA is commonly detected in the semen of male survivors in the first 3-6 months after survival, 41 and long-term semen persistence of Ebola virus RNA has been described repeatedly. [41] [42] [43] Although a rare event, sexual transmission of Ebola virus has been proven or strongly suspected eight times, with the first molecular evidence shown in 2016, 44 and several events leading to multiple generations of transmission and reignition flare-ups at the tail end of outbreak timelines. 42, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] Ebola virus RNA has been detected in the breastmilk of a female survivor 500 days after acute infection, although long-term viral persistence in this fluid has not been convincingly shown. 49 Undefined at present is the potential for Ebola virus persistence in immune-privileged tissues to cause remote inflammatory sequelae in survivors (eg, generalised fatigue, arthritis, or myalgia syndromes).",

Antibodies tend to be limited to the circulatory system. By contrast, nucleoside analogues are designed as prodrugs that foster their distribution to immune-privileged sites through cellular uptake and metabolism into directly acting antiviral drugs targeting intracellular viral replication and transcription. 17 In accordance, studies with remdesivir have shown robust penetration in the brain, eyes, and testes in crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) after a single intravenous dose. 16 Treatment of the recrudescent meningoencephalitis described above with remdesivir and highdose cortico steroids was followed by clinical recovery and Ebola virus RNA concentration decline and eventual clearance. 38 Although a single case is insufficient to find out whether the antiviral altered the clinical course of the disease, the recovery is illustrative of a potential utility of small-molecule therapeutics and the need for further study. A randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial was initiated in Liberia and Guinea to evaluate Ebola virus RNA clearance from semen by remdesivir; 52 although results are pending, similar questions are at hand regarding Ebola virus disease survivors in the current and future outbreaks.",

            "text": "Although experimental therapeutics and vaccines have been used occasionally in DR Congo for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after high-risk health-care worker exposures to Ebola virus, increasing attention has focused on the potential use of Ebola virus-specific therapeutics for PEP in non-health-care workers-ie, in the highest risk contacts of newly identified Ebola virus disease cases. Decision-making around this question has been confounded by the fact that these contacts routinely now receive a recombinant vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus vaccine expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein (VSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP; Ervebo; Merck, New Jersey, USA) 53 (approved by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and European Medicines Agency) as part of an outbreak-wide ring vaccination strategy, some of whom are essentially receiving the vaccine as PEP. Potential bidirectional interaction between the vaccine (and developing immune responses) and specific therapeutics is unknown. This concern applies especially to mAbbased therapeutics targeting the Ebola virus glycoprotein, which is expressed by rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP and Ebola virus. Indeed, un certainty about any interaction has so far precluded the use of mAb-based therapeutics as PEP in vaccinated high-risk close contacts. However, as long as there is no interaction with the rVSV\u2206G vaccine vector, effective antivirals might avoid potential intera ction around the glycoprotein axis. Indeed, remdesivir is not active against this vector 17 and could plausibly be considered as PEP in just-vaccinated high-risk contacts before the development of active vaccine-induced immunity. Although the vaccine is reported to provide high levels of protection from Ebola virus 10 days or more after vaccination, infection rates match those of unvaccinated control participants at less than 10 days after vaccination. 53 Post-exposure antiviral prophylaxis offered by a small molecule might provide immediate protection from clinical disease by reducing the severity or preventing emergence, in addition to augmenting protection provided by vaccination.",

Although there are many examples to enumerate, notable compounds include FDA-approved hepatitis drugs, such as ribavirin, with some clinical activity against Lassa fever and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever among others; 58 and sofosbuvir with activity against dengue 59 and yellow fever 60 viruses. Those in clinical development include favipiravir 61 and galidesivir, both with activity against multiple haemorrhagic fever viruses. 62 In addition to directly acting antivirals, indirect and host-directed therapeutics should also be considered for potential broad-spectrum activity and reduced potential for the development of viral resistance. 63, 64 Room for improvement: enhanced understanding of antiviral pharmacology Given existing evidence, small-molecule antivirals might have use as a component of combination therapy for acute Ebola virus disease, in the treatment of post-Ebola virus disease sequelae, and potentially as PEP. However, a greater understanding of the pharmacology of antiviral drugs to treat Ebola virus disease, including remdesivir, is necessary. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of remdesivir has not yet been done in the rhesus monkey model of Ebola virus disease or in Ebola virus-infected humans. In light of substantial hepatic and renal impairment in Ebola virus disease, such analyses could identify alterations in the formation or clearance of the active remdesivir triphosphate form of the drug. This alteration, in turn, might require an in-depth reanalysis of dose and dose schedule that might improve survival in patients treated for Ebola virus disease. Alternatively, novel nucleoside analogues could be developed that have the desired pharmacokinetic properties while maintaining efficacy. The same imperative exists to better understand the pharmacology of other antiviral approaches.",
