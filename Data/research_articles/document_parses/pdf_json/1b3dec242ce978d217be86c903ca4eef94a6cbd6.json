However, the respective contributions of various infected organs, and within these of pDCs, conventional dendritic cells and other cells, to the systemic production of IFN-a/b or other innate cytokines during viral infections in vivo is largely unknown. Whether a specialization of pDC subsets in the production of different patterns of innate cytokines exists in vivo in response to a viral infection has not been investigated. Here, by analyzing for the first time directly ex vivo, at the single-cell level, the simultaneous production of up to three cytokines in pDCs isolated from MCMV-infected mice, we show that (i) pDCs are the quasi-exclusive source of IFN-a/b, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, early during MCMV infection, in two immunocompetent mouse lines and with two viral strains, (ii) pDC activation for IFN-a/b production is organ specific and (iii) a significant proportion of pDCs simultaneously produce IFN-a/b, TNF-a and IL-12, although TNF-a and IFN-a/b appear more often co-expressed with one another than each of them with IL-12. Altogether, these results show a broad and non-redundant role of pDCs in early innate detection of, and defense against, viral infection. The data also show differences in the responsiveness of pDCs from different tissues and suggest distinct molecular requirements for pDC production of various cytokines.

The third aim was to investigate whether production of multiple innate cytokines could occur simultaneously in vivo in pDCs at the single-cell level or whether these functions reflect the existence of distinct pDC subsets specialized in the production of different cytokines. Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection was chosen as a model because it is one of the best characterized systems to study innate and adaptive immune responses to infection in vivo (14) .

Moreover, we show that pDC activation for IFN-a/b production is organ specific, with a major contribution of the spleen to the systemic production of the cytokines which contrasts with the lack of response observed in other major sites of viral replication. We also demonstrate for the first time that pDCs are the major source of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a early after viral infection, in contrast to the hypotheses proposing a predominant role of NK cells (14) or macrophages (19) for this function. A significant proportion of pDCs simultaneously produce IFN-a/b, TNF-a and IL-12 in response to MCMV infection, although TNF-a and IFN-a/b appear more often co-expressed with one another than each of them with IL-12.

Of note, the IFN-a/b response was faster, higher and sustained for longer in 129S2 as compared to C57BL/6 animals. The higher responses of the former animals are likely due to an enhanced intrinsic toll-like receptor reactivity of their pDCs (20) and to their stronger stimulation as a consequence of increased viral replication (NZ and MD unpublished data).

Mouse pDCs have been suggested to encompass different subsets of cells endowed with differential abilities for the secretion of pro-inflammatory versus IFN-a/b cytokines (13) . Human pDCs are unable to produce significant amounts of IL-12 (2, 12) , in contrast to mouse pDCs (10) . In light of these observations, we next sought to determine whether the ability of the global pDC population to simultaneously produce multiple cytokines during MCMV infection resulted from the functional specialization of distinct pDC subsets or whether it reflected the ability of each pDC to mount multiple cytokine responses. To address this question, intracellular stainings were performed for simultaneous detection of IFN-a/b, IL-12p40 and TNF-a in individual pDCs from 129S2 (Fig. 7) , BALB/c and C57BL/6 (data not shown)infected mice. All possible patterns of co-expression of the three cytokines analyzed were observed. A significant proportion of pDCs produced all the three cytokines simultaneously, about 25% of cytokine + pDCs at 30 h (Fig.  7B ) and 8% at 36 h (Fig. 7C) . Remarkably, very few pDCs produced TNF-a without producing IFN-a/b. A large proportion of pDCs produced only IL-12p40 at 36 h after infection, consistent with the delayed kinetics of appearance of this cytokine in the serum. The stronger co-expression of IFN-a/ b and TNF-a, and the delayed kinetics of IL-12p40 expression, in pDCs during MCMV infection suggests that each pDC is endowed with the ability to produce all the three cytokines analyzed but that differential molecular switches may regulate the expression of each of these cytokines as already suggested in previous studies (32, 33) . This interpretation is also supported by the observations reported by others (34, 35) that nude CpG DNA activates cDCs specifically for IL-12p40 production but pDCs also for IFN-a/b and TNF-a, while liposome-encapsulated CpG DNA can induce IFN-a/b in cDCs, due to re-routing of the oligonucleotides to different endosomes with a high retention time.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 430, "end": 434, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 499, "end": 502, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 503, "end": 506, "text": "12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 535, "end": 539, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1916, "end": 1920, "text": "(32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1921, "end": 1924, "text": "33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2004, "end": 2008, "text": "(34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2009, "end": 2012, "text": "35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1025, "end": 1033, "text": "(Fig. 7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1291, "end": 1300, "text": "(Fig.  7B", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1327, "text": "(Fig. 7C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "pDC activation for IFN-a/b production is organ specific"}, {"text": "The data presented here demonstrate that pDCs are the quasi-exclusive source of IFN-a/b production during a viral infection in vivo.

While previous studies have shown that cDCs can produce IFN-a/b in vitro upon infection with MCMV at high molecular infection ratio (8, 17) , no other IFNa/b producing cells than pDCs could be detected in infected animals by flow cytometry or immunohistofluorescence.

Indeed, the percent of IFN-a/b + cDCs is always <0.1 in 129S2 mice, even at 30 and 36 h when over 10% of the pDCs are expressing IFN-a/b. Moreover, since at 36 h postinfection in C57BL/6 mice, the percent of IFN-a/b + pDCs is 3.2 6 1.3%, the percentage of cDCs producing IFN-a/b in 129S2 mice is much lower than the percentage of pDCs producing the cytokines in C57BL/6 animals. Thus, the potential contribution of cells other than pDCs to systemic IFN-a/b production during MCMV infection in vivo is very limited in all the three strains of mice examined.

Therefore, we compared pDC activation for cytokine production in various organs known to be major targets of MCMV replication, the lung, the liver and the BM, as well as in the blood and the MLN. Strikingly, our data show that an important fraction of pDCs producing high levels of IFN-a/b is detected only in the spleen, while a much weaker production can be seen in the BM of BALB/c or 129/S2 mice, and no cells positive for the cytokines were observed in the lung, liver, blood or MLN. Therefore, our data document a compartmentalization of pDC responses to MCMV infection and demonstrate that high local viral replication is not sufficient to trigger IFNa/b production in these cells, with the major contribution of spleen pDCs to the systemic production of the cytokines contrasting strongly with the lack of detectable production in the lung or in the liver. The failure of lung pDCs to respond to MCMV infection could in part be explained by their reported lack of expression of TLR9 (21) .

Thus, no simple, discrete, subpopulations of pDCs specialized in the production of particular arrays of cytokines could be observed. Thus, the variations in individual pDC responses more likely occur as a result of quantitative changes in their differentiation status or activation kinetics as opposed to qualitative differences in their lineage origin. It should be noted that IFN-a/b and TNF-a appeared more strongly co-expressed together than with IL-12, suggesting the existence of differential molecular mechanisms of control of the expression of these cytokines as compared to IL-12 as suggested in previous reports (32, 33) . Indeed, it has been shown that the IRF-7/MyD88-dependent pathway necessary for pDC IFN-a/b production is activated in early endosomes (34, 35) , while pDC IL-12 production may occur downstream of the IRF5/TRAF-6/MyD88 pathway which is triggered in late endosomes (38) . In this regard, it is interesting to notice that human pDCs, which produce both IFN-a/b and TNF-a but not IL-12 (12) in response to TLR7/9 triggering, express much lower levels of IRF-5 that their murine counterparts or than cDCs (SHR and MD, unpublished data).
