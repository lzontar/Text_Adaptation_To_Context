It can be difficult to determine the exact pathogen responsible for the infection and patients are often treated with empiric antibiotics. This study was conducted to identify the most common clinical characteristics of enteroviral meningitis in children and evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for early detection of an enterovirus. Methods: We analyzed the medical records of children admitted to Korea University Medical Center and diagnosed with meningitis on the basis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and RT-PCR from CSF and other samples from January 2010 to August 2013. Results: A total of 333 patients were enrolled and classified into four groups based on diagnosis: enteroviral meningitis (n=110), bacterial meningitis (n=23), other viral meningitis (n=36), and unknown etiology (n=164). Patients with bacterial meningitis were younger than those in the other groups (P<0.001). Pleocytosis in CSF was similar across all groups. Of patients in the enteroviral meningitis group, 92.7% were diagnosed based on RT-PCR findings. Mean length of hospital stay for patients with enteroviral meningitis was 6.08 days, which was significantly shorter than that for patients with meningitis of bacterial etiology (19.73 days, P<0.001).

CSF pleocytosis defined as CSF white blood cell (WBC) count of \u226510 WBCs/mm 3 if the patient's age was <1 month, \u22655 WBCs/ mm 3 if the patient's age was \u22651 month.We retrospectively reviewed the patients' demographics and clinical findings including duration of fever, seizure, vomiting, CSF and blood analysis results, and RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal samples. CSF analysis included cell count, protein and glucose concentrations, culture and RT-PCR results, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Patients were classified into four groups by causative organisms as follows: group 1, enteroviral meningitis; group 2, bacterial meningitis; group 3, other viral meningitis; and group 4, meningitis of unknown etiology. Viral pathogens were detected using a real time RT-PCR panel, Anyplex II RV16 (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea), which can detect 16 viruses: influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza 1-4, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, human rhinoviruses, human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL69), human enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, and human bocavirus (Seegene Korea, Seoul, Korea). This method simultaneously detects either viral DNA or RNA using real-time RT-PCR.Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 20.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). Findings were reported with average and standard deviation values. Frequency analysis, chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and post hoc Tukey test were used. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "General characteristics of study participants with meningitis (n =333)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": ".
