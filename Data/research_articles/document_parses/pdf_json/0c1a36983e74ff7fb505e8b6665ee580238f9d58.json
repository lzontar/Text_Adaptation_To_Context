Healthcare systems and governments worldwide have been under pressure since this designation to implement strategies and containment measures against COVID-19, an unprecedented virus with challenges in all that is left to learn. 2 Extrapolation from epidemiological models of COVID-19 has suggested that intensive physical distancing could \"flatten the curve\" and prevent the overloading of our health systems. 3 Social distancing measures, aimed at reducing contact between people, include school closings, stay-athome mandates, and government support for telecommuting, 4, 5 and have become commonly adopted practices on a world-wide scale. 6 These measures aim to reduce the frequency of physical contact between persons, thereby reducing the risk of the spread of COVID-19, which is known to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. 7 Various degrees of these social distancing measures were employed in the mitigation of previous respiratory viral pandemics such as the 1918-19 influenza pandemic and the 2003 SARS outbreak, when clear pharmaceutical treatments or vaccines were unavailable.
