Design Five datasets were searched, separately integrated and analysed. Violin plot was used to show the distribution of differentially expressed genes for different clusters. The ace2-expressing and TMPrrss2expressing cells were highlighted and dissected to characterise the composition and proportion. results cell types in each dataset were identified by known markers. ace2 and TMPrss2 were not only coexpressed in lung aT2 cells and oesophageal upper epithelial and gland cells but also highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon. additionally, among all the coexpressing cells in the normal digestive system and lung, the expression of ace2 was relatively highly expressed in the ileum and colon. Conclusion This study provides the evidence of the potential route of sars-coV-2 in the digestive system along with the respiratory tract based on singlecell transcriptomic analysis. This finding may have a significant impact on health policy setting regarding the prevention of sars-coV-2 infection. Our study also demonstrates a novel method to identify the prime cell types of a virus by the coexpression pattern analysis of single-cell sequencing data.",

As such, these data may have significant impact for healthy policy setting regarding the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. 5 6 However, little is known about why and how SARS-CoV-2 induces enteric symptoms. In addition, it is currently unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the digestive tract in addition to through the respiratory tract. 3 The prerequisite of coronavirus infection is its entrance into a host cell. During this process, the spike (S) glycoprotein recognises host cell receptors and induces the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. 7 In SARS-CoV-2 infection, a metallopeptidase, ACE II (ACE2) has been proven to be the cell receptor, similar to SARS-CoV infection. [8] [9] [10] [11] Currently, evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 requires ACE2 to enter the host cell. 9 Beside, the transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) is the main host cell protease which cleave the S protein of human coronaviruses on the cell membrane, allowing the virus to release fusion peptide for membrane fusion. 12 13 Therefore, coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is critical for the cell entry process of SARS-CoV-2.",

Relative low expression of TMPRSS2 was also found in Goblet, Ganglion and TA cells ( figure 5C,D) .

AT1cells could also be the host cells of infection, which have relatively lower expression than AT2 cells. These results were consistent with the findings of a previous study. 39 In lung alveoli, AT1 epithelial cells are responsible for gas exchange and AT2 cells are in charge of surfactant biosynthesis and self-renewal. 40 In SARS-CoV infection, AT2 is the major infected cell type, as assessed by viral antigen and secretory vesicle detection. Its expression in AT2 cells is variable in different donors, which may be associated with susceptibility and seriousness differences. 39 Thus, we hypothesise that AT2 cells might be the key SARS-CoV-2-invaded cells in the lung and the number of AT2 cells might be associated with the severity of respiratory symptoms.",

            "text": "Besides the lung, coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found in oesophageal upper and gland cells and absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon. Histologically, both oesophageal and respiratory system organs, such as the trachea and lung, originate from the anterior portion of the intermediate foregut. 41 After separating from the neighbouring respiratory system, the oesophagus undergoes subsequent morphogenesis from a simple columnar-to-stratified squamous epithelium. 42 The upper epithelium can be nourished by submucosal glands and sustain the passage of abrasive raw food. In Barrett's oesophagus, acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium are associated with upper epithelial cells. 43 In the digestive system, in addition to being expressed in oesophageal upper epithelial and gland cells, coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was also found in the absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon, the most vulnerable intestinal epithelial cells. During microbial infections, intestinal epithelial cells function as a barrier and help coordinate immune responses. 44 The absorptive enterocytes can be infected by coronavirus, rotavirus and noroviruses, resulting in diarrhoea by absorptive enterocytes destruction, malabsorption, unbalanced intestinal secretion and enteric nervous system activation. [45] [46] [47] Although most virus would be dead in the strong acid environment in the stomach, there is still a possibility that the saliva and secretions could carry the virus into the digestive tract where viral replication may be sustained in these susceptible cells. Thus, the enteric symptom of diarrhoea might be associated with the infected ACE2-expressing and TMPRSS2expressing enterocytes. This could also help explain the fact that 10% of patients presented with diarrhoea and nausea 1 or 2 days before the development of fever and respiratory symptoms. 6 Moreover, due to the high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in oesophageal upper cells and absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon, we propose that the digestive system could be invaded by SARS-CoV-2 and might serve as a route of infection. This supposition was supported by the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA, whose stool specimen obtained on illness day 7 was detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA. 48 SARS-CoV-2 was also isolated from a stool specimen of a confirmed case in China. 49 addi-tionallyThe evidence that live virus in stool specimens further supports our hypothesis.",
