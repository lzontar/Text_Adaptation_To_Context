The benefit of such behavioural adaptations can be modelled as the deceleration of the exponential growth of cases. Humans underestimate exponential growth, as has been documented in biological 4 , environmental 5-6 and financial contexts 7-13 . Hence, they might also underestimate the benefit of reducing the exponential growth rate. Different ways of communicating the same scenario, i.e. frames, have been found to have a large impact on people's evaluations and choices in the contexts of social behaviour 14,15 , risk taking [16] [17] [18] [19] and health care 20-23 . Here we show that framing matters for people's assessment of the benefits of measures to mitigate the spread of infectious disease. In two commonly used frames, most subjects in our experiment drastically underestimate the number of cases mitigation measures avoid. Framing growth in terms of doubling times, rather than growth rates, improves understanding. In a non-standard framing, which focuses on time gained rather than cases avoided, the median subject assesses the benefit of mitigation measures correctly. These findings suggest changes that public health authorities can adopt to communicate the exponential spread of infectious disease more effectively.

However, while their costs are directly felt, their benefit is abstract: they slow the prospective exponential growth of the infectious disease.
