Due to the large storage space and scalability, Clouds became an attractive place where the data can be stored, processed, and analyzed in order to perform the monitoring on large scale and possibly detect dangerous situations. The use of fuzzy sets in the monitoring and detection processes allows incorporating expert knowledge and medical standards while describing the meaning of various sensor readings. Calculations related to fuzzy processing and data analysis can be performed on the Edge devices which frees the Cloud platform from performing costly operations, especially for many connected IoT devices and monitored people. In this paper, we show a solution that relies on fuzzy rules while classifying health states of monitored adults and we investigate the computational cost of rules evaluation in the Cloud and on the Edge devices.",

Falls, for example, are the leading cause of death from injury in the elderly [1] . Older adults often require more attention from family members or caregivers, and should more frequently monitor their health, especially after some disease-related incidents, like a heart attack or stroke. However, even after these health-related incidents, older adults want to come back to the normal, active life and stay as much self-reliant as possible. This gives them a sense of being part of society and the sense of being needed. Still, disease-related incidents or age-related problems cause many fears among older people, like What happens to me when the incident happens, again? or Will I be able to call emergency in case of danger?, and cast doubts on whether they are able to handle their daily duties. Such incidents also raise many questions among family members -Are my parents safe at the moment? or How do they feel today when it is so hot or humid?. Daily phone calls made by family members to their older relatives are nice, but they can also cause older adults to feel being controlled. These questions and doubts motivate the efforts to build noninvasive, subtle and unobtrusive systems that would allow to keep an eye on older people without disturbing them in their lives and react only in case of dangers.",

The big number of continuously monitored parameters of many patients causes a large amount of data that must be sent to the medical monitoring center. The situation when data from many patients are sent simultaneously or many users are retrieving data at the same time can cause network congestion and database overload [5, 10] . The answer to this problem can be the Edge computing technology.

Obtained values of the parameters (e.g., heart rate) may fall into certain ranges, which are defined by the existing medical standards and decide whether the obtained value is normal or abnormal, but still, it is important to know how much abnormal the situation is and whether it is getting better or worse. For this reason, we decided to use fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic while creating flexible rules for monitoring older adults and alerting caregivers in case of danger. The application of fuzzy rules gives us not only the information on whether a given rule is satisfied or not but also how much it is satisfied (the degree of truth). Moreover, further monitoring of the degree of truth for the rule allows to observe its changes (increase or decrease), which can be valuable information in the decision-making process (e.g., regarding possible reactions for the health state of the monitored person).",

Taking into account the conducted research, we can distinguish two or three basic research approaches to using fuzzy logic in IoT. Firstly, fuzzy logic is used to reduce the amount of data flowing from the sensors (incoming frequency), which improves the performance of data analysis. Secondly, several systems also use the fuzzy logic to convert sensor data using specific fuzzy rules to the linguistic values of the relevant linguistic variables, and thirdly, fuzzy rules are also used to control home or industrial automation systems, monitoring or notification.",

The amount of data flowing from sensors (sent from mobile clients to the server) was reduced and the data quality and the analysis performance were improved (the reduction of the input data ranged between 51.54% and 53.6%).

Authors also proposed adding fuzzy logic to the initial classification of resources in order to reduce the computational costs generated by MCDA algorithms they use. In the work [11] , the authors applied fuzzy logic in a fire detection system. The use of fuzzy logic allows to optimize and limit the number of rules that should be checked in order to make the right decisions. The reduction of rules decreases the activity of fire sensors without significantly affecting performance. It also leads to the extended life of batteries used in sensors.",

In the work [2] , Chen presented a smart agent-based tracking system based on the IoT architecture using fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) and fuzzy rules for describing the product life cycle. In [18] , Araujo et al. proposed an approach to choosing the IoT route using fuzzy logic to meet the requirements of specific applications. In this case, the fuzzy logic is used to mathematically describe imprecise information expressed by a set of linguistic rules.",

In the work [14] , the authors used the fuzzy logic in two stages: in the first one, the fuzzy logic is used to transform the outside temperature, internal temperature and air humidity taken from sensors to linguistic values (according to pre-defined fuzzy rules). In the next step, the fuzzy rules were used to determine the best moment in which heating or climatic systems should be switched on or switched off. Similarly, in the work [19] Santamar\u00eda et al. implemented fuzzy logic in two stages of data processing. In the first stage, data read from sensors are transformed according to fuzzy rules into appropriate linguistic values corresponding to the states of human activity (resting, walking, running). In the second step, based on these states and current readings from wearable sensors, anomalies are detected (e.g., increased heart rate) and an appropriate message is generated to the user. In the work [9] , the fuzzy logic is used to infer about the health state of the production machine that is being monitored. Raw data from sensors (e.g., the amount of smoke, temperature) are sent to the Cloud. Then, fuzzy rules are used to convert these raw data to the appropriate linguistic terms (low, high, typical, etc.), and in the next step, a corresponding message is generated to the user reporting the health state of the machine. Our solution also falls in the second and the third approach, but in contrast to presented solutions, the fuzzy data analysis and classification is performed on the Edge, which will be implemented in the architecture presented in the next section.",

For the purpose of the project, we monitored a heart rate (hr) and the number of steps taken in a unit of time (steps per minute, spm) by a person wearing the smart band (activity). Sensor readings are sent from the smart band to the smartphone working under control of the Android operating system through the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. The Bluetooth protocol has appropriate communication profiles defined for the purpose of communication between devices. During the communication between the smart band and the smartphone, we used the Health Device Profile (HDP) that defines the way of communication with devices such as scales, glucometers, thermometers, and other medical devices.

The detection of danger may be also immediately reported to the monitored person through the application installed on the smartphone without exchanging additional messages with the Cloud center, which reduces latency and informs the person on the possible danger. The application can be easily extended to automatically call medical services to send an ambulance to the patient in particular circumstances, but this possibility has not been implemented and tested yet. Fuzzy rules (described in more details in Sect. 4) are defined in the IoT Device module in the Cloud, exactly in the IoT Hub service, and are distributed to the IoT devices while initiating the Device-to-Cloud communication. The Band2Recorder application communicates with the Cloud using the Internet, which is necessary for the operation of the designed system. The application also supplements the sensor data with the information on the location of the monitored person (latitude and longitude obtained from the smartphone), which helps to localize the person in emergency situations. Communication between the mobile application and the Cloud is carried out using the MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) data protocol.

The IoT Hub contains the IoT Device module that stores the definitions of the fuzzy rules that specify in which situations sensor readings are labeled as unusual.

In both variants (the Edge-based and the Cloud-based rule evaluation), messages labeled as alerting (indicating increased risk levels) are transferred to a queue in the Service Bus service. They are consumed and analyzed by the Logic Apps module, which creates and sends appropriate notifications to a defined caregiver or a family member. Notifications are adjusted to the risk level describing the importance of the detected problem and to the class of danger. All messages collected on the IoT Hub are also placed in the BLOB storage space for further analysis. BLOB is a binary repository that stores data exactly as they were sent to the Cloud. By storing and analyzing all of the transferred data, the caregiver can get a broader view of the situation after he was notified on the occurrence of the unusual state. Further analysis of the collected data with other (e.g., ML-based) data exploration methods may also allow detection of early symptoms of incoming problems.

Especially, that rules can be adjusted for particular persons. We tested how evaluation of fuzzy rules evaluated by the stream processing units in the Cloud influences their operational capabilities. To this purpose, during our experiments with older people, we measured the size of each message (event) sent to the Cloud by the IoT device with Band2Recorder application. Each message always took 862B. With certain periods between sending successive messages from the device and assuming a uniform data transfer between the device and the Cloud, we can easily estimate the network traffic and the consumption of the Cloud storage space. Figure 3 shows how much data will be transferred through the network and then stored in the Cloud within 24-h monitoring time for various periods between sending successive messages containing sensor readings. As can be observed, sending data every minute generates 1.2 MB of data that must be transferred within 24 h. This is not much, taking into account that the caregiver or the family member can be notified quite quickly in the situation of danger (with a 1-min latency). Longer periods between taking data from the smart band and between data transfers (less frequent readings) allow to further decrease the network traffic and the storage space consumed (e.g., 0.06 MB for 20-min periods), but increase the latency and should be used in situations when we monitor a general daily health state of the person without the necessity to react immediately. Figure 4 shows the total level of the network traffic and the consumption of the storage space within the 30-days monitoring time for various time periods between successive sensor readings. Consequently, Fig. 5 shows the number of messages sent to the Cloud within the 30-days monitoring time for various time periods between successive sensor readings. Both figures are useful when planning hardware infrastructure and a level of services upon which the monitoring system working in the Cloud is built. For example, the S1 tier of the IoT Hub, which allows to connect any number of IoT devices and to receive 400,000 messages daily, costs 25 USD per month (as for January 22, 2020, on the basis of [15] ).",

We connected the digital twin to our architecture in the place of the smartphone with the Band2Recorder application. With the use of the digital twin, we were able to test the system for a variable number of connected devices. We monitored the maximum utilization of streaming units (%) in two cases: (1) when fuzzy rules were implemented in the stream processing job and evaluated directly on stream processing units, and (2) when fuzzy rules were implemented at the Edge (were implemented within the digital twin). Results of these tests are presented in Fig. 6 . In such an experimental environment, we simulated the load generated by several thousands of IoT devices (up to 10,000). Results show that, while processing events already labeled at the Edge, the utilization of resources of the Stream Processing Unit is quite constant, At the same time, for the increasing number of IoT devices the additional overhead related to evaluation of fuzzy rules in the Cloud (implemented directly in the Stream Processing Unit) causes slow but constant increase in the maximum utilization of streaming units (Max % SU utilization). This increase leads to the necessity of scaling the system on processing units faster, than in the case when fuzzy rules are implemented on the Edge device. Although we could expect such a behavior, we can observe the dynamics of the process for both implementations. ",

As a consequence, the data can be labeled very quickly on personal devices and in such a form transmitted to the Cloud data center. This frees the Cloud data center from the analysis and classification of data coming from many such devices. Such an implementation also postpones the need for scaling the system resources. Linguistic values represented by fuzzy sets allow assigning sensor readings to meaningful terms and, by applying fuzzy rules, use them in reasoning about the current health state of the monitored person. Our experiments confirmed that even with a relatively short periods between data transmissions the volume of data sent to the Cloud within 24 h is relatively low, which in contrast to several use cases mentioned in [20] gives the comfort of collecting all data at least for some groups of monitored people or collecting the data for some period of time when the risk appears. Finally, our conclusions on the advantages of implementing fuzzy intelligence on the Edge can be generalized. This group of techniques can be applied not only in monitoring older adults but also in other domains, where IoT devices can improve or optimize ongoing processes.",
