Yet these same facial features express human individuality, and are crucial to nonverbal communication. Even in a crisis, human connection is at the core of medical care, 1 and PPE, while necessary, can interrupt that connection. 2 Especially for COVID-19 patients needing ICU care, some worry that a lack of human connection can have adverse effects beyond simple satisfaction or patient experience measures. Studies have shown that isolated ICU patients may develop \"post intensive-care syndrome,\" which mimics PTSD with sometimes debilitating consequences. A 2010 systematic review of patients placed in contact isolation for infection control showed adverse impacts of isolation on mental well-being, satisfaction, and several measures of patient safety. 3 Conversely, provider warmth and compassion have been positively associated with physiological health biomarkers, and researchers have called for testing interventions to promote perceptions of kindness. 4 Healthcare workers across the USA intent on humanizing the COVID-19 experience have innovated alternative communication methods to bridge the gap between PPEcovered provider and patient. At Parkland Hospital, providers created handouts with photos, names, and reassuring text (\"Dear Friend\u2026you are in the hands of people who care about your health\"). Stanford Hospital, among many others, is implementing virtual rounding, which allows providers to meet \"face-to-face\" with hospitalized patients over secure video prior to in-person physical exams during which their features will be necessarily obscured.",

They are simply disposable provider portrait picture stickers (4\" \u00d7 5\") affixed to PPE where patients can see them. Anecdotal pilot data captured during treatment of Ebola showed that PPE Portraits helped patients feel more connected to their caregivers, and helped healthcare workers feel more like a team and connected to one another, though this has yet to be rigorously studied (Figs. 1). 5 In partnership with the designer of the original PPE Portrait Project in Africa, Mary Beth Heffernan, Stanford Express Care is piloting PPE Portraits for the newly created drive-thru COVID-19 testing. 6 Similarly, the inpatient palliative care team at UMass Memorial Medical Center has begun using PPE Portraits in caring for seriously ill patients in the hospital, regardless of infection status.",
