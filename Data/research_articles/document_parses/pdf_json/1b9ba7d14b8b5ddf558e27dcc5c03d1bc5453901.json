Facing a sharp decline in revenue, many hospitals have initiated layoffs, furloughs, and salary cuts to contain costs and maintain financial viability. 3 A detailed analysis of hospital cost structure remains an unexplored area in the literature.

The amount of the labor component and the non-labor-non-capital component was reported for each cost item within these categories. The capital costs of building and equipment, such as depreciation, were reported in the overhead category. 4 First, we aggregated the operating costs of all hospitals in the sample. Second, we separated capital costs from other overhead costs, grouped all operating costs based on their type and function, and compared the relative magnitude across groupings. Third, we analyzed the proportion of capital, labor, and non-capital-non-labor components in each major cost item that accounted for at least 0.5% of total operating costs. Lastly, we identified patient care services (i.e., ancillary, inpatient, and outpatient) that incurred relatively large costs (> 2.0% of total operating costs) and examined their weight in the cost structure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 441, "end": 442, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS"}, {"text": "Private short-term general hospitals incurred $732.2 billion in total operating costs in 2018.

Based on the cost type, noncapital-non-labor costs constituted 54.6% of total operating costs (28.1% for overhead and 26.5% for patient care), labor costs 41.3% (15.8% for overhead and 25.5% for patient care), and capital costs 4.0%.

Operating room, laboratory, diagnostic radiology, general routine inpatient care, intensive care unit, outpatient clinic, and emergency room incurred approximately one-third of hospitals' total operating costs. The cancelation of elective surgery and the decline of hospital visits caused by COVID-19 have shrunk revenue from these services and motivated hospitals to reduce costs from these services. When the reduction of non-capital-non-labor costs (e.g., medical supplies) was insufficient, many hospitals chose to cut the labor costs of these services, thus disrupting the compensation of the patient care labor force.
