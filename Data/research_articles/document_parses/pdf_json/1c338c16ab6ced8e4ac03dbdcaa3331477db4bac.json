While the COVID-19 pandemic is dominating attention, reports are emerging that patients with urgent non-COVID-19 health concerns may not be getting adequate or standard treatment due to resource constraints, or concerns regarding the risk of coronavirus exposure to the self, to other patients or healthcare workers (HCW). These ripple effects may affect many patients adversely with long-lasting and deleterious outcomes. Hospitals and healthcare systems must adopt a standardized approach to provide the best possible care to all patients regardless of their COVID-19 status. This is particularly important for the cardiology community, given that patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and risk factors are potentially more likely to acquire COVID-19 and experience adverse outcomes (2) (3) (4) (5) . As the spread of the virus increases, many cardiac patients will seek medical care either for COVID-19 related illnesses or traditional cardiac issues such as acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, or heart failure. Many of these patients will require a cardiac procedure while simultaneously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, increasing reports of acute and de novo cardiac presentations such as myocarditis, arrhythmia, and heart failure in patients without prior cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors are also emerging, possibly due to an accentuated host immune response and cytokine storm (2) . The international cardiovascular community urgently needs to develop consensus algorithms to provide the best care for all such issues, while minimizing the risk to HCW. Here we present our consensus guidance for the management of various CV conditions in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. It is important to note that all recommendations are made in the setting of emerging, but limited evidence and will most likely evolve as additional clinical information becomes available. Recommendations in this best practice document should be used as a general clinical guidance only and decisions need to be individualized.",

Coagulation factors Xa and IIa have been demonstrated to be capable of cleaving the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and may, hence promote infectivity(27). Therefore, anticoagulation might inhibit this process and suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication. While the empiric use of therapeutic anticoagulation for all critically ill patients with elevated D-dimer (>6 times the ULN) has been recommended by several centers in China even without a diagnosis of VTE (28), given lack of any significant evidence of its utility and potentially increased risk of bleeding, particularly pulmonary hemorrhage in patients with ARDS and DIC decision needs to be individualized and carefully weighed against the risks.We recommend thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux (suggested over unfractionated heparin to reduce contact) for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 unless the patient is judged to be at increased risk of bleeding. LMWH has a theoretical advantage of possessing anti-inflammatory properties, which can be of additional benefit in COVID-19 infection. For patients with acute kidney injury or creatinine clearance <30 ml/minute, unfractionated heparin at a dose of 5,000 units subcutaneously two to three times a day should be utilized.If a COVID-19 patient develops VTE or presents with VTE despite prophylactic anticoagulation, we recommend pharmacotherapy, preferably with full therapeutic dose LMWH (unless CrCl<30 ml/min). Catheter-directed thrombectomy or thrombolysis should be reserved only for those patients with massive or sub-massive pulmonary embolism or proximal deep vein thrombosis with either limb-threatening ischemia who either fail systemic thrombolysis or are not considered good candidates for thrombolysis given the increased risk of bleeding.

The number of personnel involved in resuscitation efforts should be minimized for any patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Use of appropriate PPE, including an N95 mask, face shield, gown, and gloves, is crucial for all involved individuals, even if it delays the initiation of resuscitation. There is also a risk of resuscitation cart (code cart) contamination during the process, and institutions could consider preparing -resuscitation bags\u2016 with all the necessary medications and instruments for use in patients with either suspected or confirmed COVID-19. All unused material from such bags should be disposed or cleaned afterward. During resuscitation, while attempts to secure the airway are in process, oxygen should be applied via a non-rebreather mask without humidification. The use of high-flow nasal cannula, and non-invasive ventilation (CPAP, BiPAP) should be avoided given the high risk of aerosolization (35). Prior to initiating chest compressions, a surgical facemask should be placed over the patient's face. When available, external mechanical compression devices should be used to minimize the exposure to HCW. Until a definitive airway is obtained, compression-only resuscitation should be performed given the increased risk of viral aerosolization with bag-mask ventilation. Prolonged resuscitation in patients with poor prognosis should be avoided particularly if there is no reversible etiology identified.",
