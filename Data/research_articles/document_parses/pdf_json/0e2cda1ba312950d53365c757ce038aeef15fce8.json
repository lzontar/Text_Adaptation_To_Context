In the context of COVID-19, the broad immune-suppression conferred by conventional systemic agents, such as methotrexate, may downregulate protective host antiviral immune responses. On the other hand, should treatment need to be paused in the pandemic, the longer half-life and particular pharmacokinetics of biological therapies will limit the speed of their systemic clearance. Although real-world observational data suggest an increased risk of serious infections with some agents 5,6 , their relative safety in relation to COVID-19 is unknown 7 . Conversely, there is a theoretical protective role of immunomodulators in attenuating a severe systemic inflammatory response to infection. JAK inhibitors (which have demonstrated efficacy in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis in clinical trials) and interleukin-1 inhibitors are being explored as treatments for COVID-19 8 . Finally, genome-wide association studies have uncovered a",

The forms collect patient demographics, comorbidities, change in psoriasis/atopic dermatitis severity during COVID-19, immunomodulator medications (including drug exposure prior to/during the illness), and COVID-19 symptoms, management and outcome. The rapid adoption of virtual care models in the current pandemic has transformed the landscape of dermatological practice and is highly conducive to reporting cases of COVID-19 via PsoPROTECT and SECURE-AD. Data are collected online and processed solely for the purpose of medical research undertaken in the public interest. No patient identifiers are collected, and the data are housed on secure servers.",
