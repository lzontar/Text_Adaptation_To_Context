Our choice of a parametric model for the incubation period has more flexibility than other commonly used distributions. This flexible model was reduced to the Weibull distribution, a special case as reported in Backer et al [1] and Linton et al [4] (Supplement S5). We also used a descriptive method to check the model fitting by comparing a nonparametric estimation of the incubation distribution for interval-censored data with the model-based estimation under the Weibull distribution by age groups. As shown in Supplement S6, the Weibull distribution fits the data adequately. To examine how sensitive the estimates were to the assumption of 30 days of maximum exposure for cases with missing starting date of exposure interval, we performed the analyses by changing this maximum exposure duration to 20 days or by shifting the lower bound back and forth within 15 days. The changed assumptions had little effect on analysis results (Supplement S7). This analysis has some notable limitations. Our inferences relied on publicly reported confirmed cases that might over represent more severely symptomatic patients. Moreover, the definition of COVID-19 symptoms and hospitalization criteria could differ by country, especially during the initial outbreak. We combined the data sets from two different sources, and the potential variation in source criteria for tracing infected cases may lead to different exposure records.
