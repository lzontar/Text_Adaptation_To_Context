The importance of creating dynamical probabilistic models of disease dynamics capable of predicting future new cases from past and present disease incidence data is emphasized. Methods for real-time data assimilation, which rely on probabilistic formulations and on Bayes' theorem to translate between probability densities for new cases and for model parameters are developed. This formulation creates future outlook with quantified uncertainty, and leads to natural anomaly detection schemes that quantify and detect disease evolution or population structure changes. Finally, the implementation of these methods and accompanying intervention tools in real time public health situations is realized through their embedding in state of the art information technology and interactive visualization environments.",

Its goals include the prevention or mitigation of epidemic growth, if possible by setting quantitative targets for intervention as events unfold and by providing a running time expectation for logistic allocations, including medicines, hospital beds and vaccines, if available. The success of real time public health surveillance depends on our ability to develop not only effective detection systems but also ways of evaluating the uncertainties associated with outbreaks, methods and models.",

Hence, the need to develop statistical models of data assimilation that effectively estimate the changing parameters that characterize models of disease dynamics. In this paper a general procedure for data assimilation from real time data streams that feeds into epidemic models of communicable disease spread is developed. This procedure allows i) the estimation of probability densities for epidemiological parameters (such as disease transmissibility) and ii) the prediction of future observables with a quantified degree of confidence. This dynamical estimation/extrapolation environment lends itself naturally to a statistical anomaly detection scheme capable of identifying shifts in the public health status of a population, either via pathogen evolution, or as the result of changes in the population structure.",

It is essential to produce running time statistics that incorporate past and present measurements as well as ways to assimilate these data to generate probabilistic predictions of new cases with quantified uncertainty because often the objective of real time surveillance is to detect change. This approach also allows the use of statistical estimation to partially bypass issues of non-stationarity in the data, which typically hinder purely statistical (stationary) approaches to syndromic surveillance. Technically, this can be achieved by adopting a probabilistic approach to the prediction of new cases (or their proxy variables) at a given time t, \u0394C(t), given past incidence time series and a model for the disease dynamics written in terms of a set of parameters \u0393 . The set \u0393 includes familiar parameters such as measures of transmissibility (e.g. the reproduction number R) and the duration of the infectious and incubation periods.",

            "text": "Here we focus on the estimation of a key quantity in epidemiology known as the reproduction number or ratio which quantifies the transmissibility of infectious diseases under identifiable initial conditions. In the context of novel infectious pathogens (e.g., the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, or the 2002-03 SARS epidemic) to which most of the population is completely susceptible, the basic reproduction number (denoted by R 0 ) quantifies the number of secondary cases generated by a primary case during its period of infectiousness within a purely susceptible population. In more practical situations, the population's actual susceptibility is affected by recurrent exposures to the infectious agent (e.g., dengue fever, influenza), vaccination campaigns (e.g., influenza, measles, mumps) and by \"depletion\" of susceptibles during the course of an outbreak. Then, the reproduction number denoted by R accounts for the residual immunity in the population. The relationship between R 0 and R may be modeled by R = (1 \u2212 p)R 0 where p denotes the proportion of the population that is effectively protected to infection, assuming a well-mixed population [5, 7, 18, 19, 20] . In the advent of an epidemic, the timely estimation of the reproduction number with the minimal amount of available data crucial as it would allow public health authorities to determine the types and intensity of interventions necessary to achieve fast epidemic control. The level of critical vaccination coverage needed to diminish or eliminate various infectious diseases have also been determined from the magnitude of the estimated reproduction number [5, 7, 18, 19, 20] .",

Classical epidemiological models such as SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) or SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) are of this form.

The Bayesian method described in section 3 allows the prediction of the number of cases, with given confidence bounds. Whenever the number of observed cases falls outside that prediction an anomaly is detected and the need for further epidemiological investigation is flagged. Here such events start happening from week 15. smaller than those corresponding to probability p, or are larger than those corresponding to 1 \u2212 p. The significance \u03b1 is typically chosen to be \u03b1 = 0.05, which corresponds to (dis)agreement with model predictions at 95% confidence level.",

The changes in disease dynamics (anomalies), may result from co-evolutionary processes, that is, from the interplay between pathogen evolution and changing social landscapes and, consequently, while their detection may be possible, the identification of the underlying mechanisms may not be straightforward without further investigation.",

The key to coordinating model runs and data transfers lies with the methods used to access the database. Scripts, written in R, connect to the database and execute an SQL command that imports a frame of current data into R. Additional R commands transform the data to match the required format for the spatial and statistical analysis. The results are uploaded back into the database into tables which can be queried and rendered by Minerva. Each time a layer is selected for visualization, Minerva starts an R script, waits for the database to indicate it has been updated, and renders the data. Minerva stores binary versions of the rendered layers so they can be turned on and off through the user interface without running the algorithms multiple times during a session.",

In addition, it allows the visualization of multiple interchangeable data sets simultaneously. Thus, this system can be used for several critical features of a real-time public health information system, such as: 1) data acquisition, storage, and retrieval; 2) exploring the descriptive epidemiology of the disease; 3) determining the major demographic and socio-economic factors that contribute to the spread of the disease, 4) the development of modeling and simulation exercises, and 5) assessing the effects of health interventions in human populations.",

Current approaches to disease transmission modeling rely too heavily on the analysis of historical data or on the ability to predict future outbreaks, but overlook the needs of public health officials to understand the current unfolding situations in ways that extract meaningful knowledge. The modeling approach in this paper takes a significant step towards the creation of quantitative tools that can deliver real time information to health officials who can best apply the knowledge gained. The visualization of that information in a real-time spatial context is necessary to base real-time decisions that include the current state of disease epidemics as they unfold. Table- top exercises, simulation, and analyses of current infections in the population in cooperation with public health officials also serve to educate health professionals on how to use the information system prior to outbreaks in meaningful ways that will be directly transferable to the monitoring and management of actual health events.",
