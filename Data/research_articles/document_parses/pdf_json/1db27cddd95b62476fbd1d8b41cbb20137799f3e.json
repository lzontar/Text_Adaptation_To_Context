Since the potential for SARS-CoV2 to remain viable in a closed environment as an aerosol for three hours was first reported, there has been ongoing concern about the role of airborne transmission, especially for healthcare providers (HCPs) involved in aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) (e.g., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy) [2, 3] . Additionally, transmission from asymptomatic and/or pre-symptomatic individuals has been reported, although the extent in which they play a role in widespread transmission remains uncertain [4, 5] .

It is very unlikely that the cough developed by a single HCP was related to the exposure incident. Given testing limitations at the time, we were unable to test asymptomatic patients for SARS-CoV2 infection prior to surgical interventions, though we are now adopting this practice in our institution.
