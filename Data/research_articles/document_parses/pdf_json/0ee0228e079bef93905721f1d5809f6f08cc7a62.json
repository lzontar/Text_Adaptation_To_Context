This is while humans are present in the room. Both the expected and worst-case scenarios are investigated to show the efficacy of the upper-room UV-C approach to reduce COVID-19 air transmission in a confined space with moderate but sufficient height. Discussion is given on the methods of analysis and the differences between virus susceptibility to UV-C when aerosolised or in liquid or on a surface.",

In particular, upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), a technology that disinfects room air, has been muted as a potential intervention that might prove effective against COVID-19 [8] [9] [10] . Upperroom UVGI utilizes UV-C light at wavelengths close to 254 nm to create an irradiation field above the heads of room occupants ( Figure 1 ) that disinfects aerosolised bacteria and viruses suspended in the air [11] [12] [13] . Because UV-C light is harmful to humans, such systems utilize baffles that obscure the UV lamps from eyesight so that room occupants are safe. As such, upper-room UVGI is a well-established technology [14, 15] that has proven effective as a public health intervention to prevent the spread of airborne diseases such as measles [16] and tuberculosis (TB) [17, 18] in buildings.",

A summary of the findings of several key studies are presented in Table 6 , which reveals that most viral species appear to be relatively easy to disinfect when suspended in droplets in the air. In particular, aerosolised viruses appear to be more vulnerable to UV damage than when they are suspended in a liquid or on a substrate. For example, for the 24 irradiation experiments involving adenoviruses suspended in liquid, reported by Kowalski [28] , the average Z value was 0.00586 m 2 /J, which is an order of magnitude less than the values of 0.0546 and 0.0390 m 2 /J for aerosolised adenoviruses, attributed to Jensen [31] and Walker and Ko [29] respectively. Regarding coronaviruses, Walker and Ko [29] also performed experiments on aerosolised murine (mouse) hepatitis virus (MHV) coronavirus in a single pass test rig. This revealed a Z value of 0.377 \u00b1 0.119 m 2 /J for this virus, which is several orders of magnitude greater than the values obtained above for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in liquids and on surfaces (Table 3 ). Although we are comparing different species of coronavirus here, evidence from Bedell et al. [33] , who irradiated MHV coronavirus and MERS-CoV in Petri dishes, suggests that it is nonetheless valid. They found that 5 minutes exposed to a UV-C light source resulted in a 2.71 log reduction for the MHV coronavirus, whereas the same exposure resulted in a 5.91 log reduction for MERS-CoV. This suggests that MHV coronavirus is actually more resistant to UV damage than MERS-CoV, and as such, supports Walker and Ko's [29] conclusion that All rights reserved.

Notwithstanding this, because of the uncertainty associated with how aerosolised SARS-CoV-2 might behave in reality, we also modelled a worst-case scenario in which Z ur was 0.0377 m 2 /J. Table 7 presents the results of the room analysis using these two values for Z ur , for a range of ventilation rates. From this it can be seen that there is a direct inverse relationship between particle residence time in the UV field, t uv , and the required irradiation flux, E r , as predicted by equation 8. This means that for any given Z value, the value of E r will double as the room ventilation rate doubles. The table also reveals that there is a direct inverse relationship between Z ur and E r . From the calculated values in this table it can be seen that if Z ur , = 0.377 m 2 /J, then with an average UV flux of just 10 \u03bc W/cm 2 it should be possible to achieve >90% inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, even at a ventilation rate of 8 AC/h. However, if in reality, Z ur , is 0.0377 m 2 /J, then all the calculated fluxes would have to increase by a factor of ten to achieve the same results. Given that accepted guidelines [15] recommend for a room 2.5 m high, one 30 W (input) UV lamp per 18.58 m 2 of floor area, which will produce an average flux in the region 50 \u03bc W/cm 2 , this means that even under this worse-case scenario it should still be possible to achieve disinfection rates >90% for all but the highest ventilation rates.",

In particular, the type of substrate or media used can greatly influence the outcome of the experiment. This is because the substrate or media can absorb the UV photons and shield the virus. Given this, it is important to compare like with like, if this is possible. For this reason we included the results of Heimbuch and Harnish [4] in Tables 3 and 5 , because they performed the same irradiation experiment on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, as well as on four strains of influenza A, thus allowing direct comparisons to be made. From Tables 3 and 5 it can be seen that the Z values for the influenza strains are of a similar order of magnitude as those for the coronaviruses, implying that in this context SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV were about as difficult to inactivate as influenza A. This is a surprising finding, because others have suggested that the UV dose required to disinfect SARS-CoV-2 might be much higher than that required to disinfect influenza A [5] . Indeed, in a summary collated from hundreds of published studies by Kowalski [28] , the Z values for influenza A in water were reported as being in the range 0.04800 -0.13810 m 2 /J, much higher than the values achieved by Heimbuch and Harnish [4] . As such, this suggests that the substrate or medium in which microbe is irradiated plays an important role in influencing the magnitude of the Z value achieved. Indeed, it is well known in other contexts that UV-C light can be attenuated as it All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

As a result there is a paucity of good quality data relating to UV-C irradiation of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in the air. Consequently, we had to establish whether or not Walker and Ko's [29] published Z value of 0.377 m 2 /J was valid for SARS-CoV-2 in air. Comparison with the Z values presented in Table 3 reveals that this value is several orders of magnitude greater than those achieve when coronaviruses are irradiated in liquid or on equipment substrates. This however, is to be expected given that liquids attenuate UV penetration [35] . Also the finding appears to be broadly in keeping with the behaviour of adenoviruses when irradiated in air and in liquid. Furthermore, because Bedell et al. [33] found MERS-CoV to be more susceptible to UV-C damage than MHV coronavirus, this strongly supports the use of Walker and Ko's [29] Z value for MHV coronavirus as a valid surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 in air.",

However, while this specifically applies to aerosolised bacteria that can rapidly repair UV damage when the irradiation process becomes fragmented [38] , it is not known to what extent this applies to viruses, which are not metabolically active, although it is known that through photoreactivation viruses can repair UV damage [39].",

By installing such as system it is possible to effectively 'turbo-charge' the efficacy of the ventilation system. Indeed, our analysis suggests that it is possible to achieve >100 equivalent AC/h by installing upper-room UVGI. Using equation 9, we can calculate the UV rate constant, k uv , which can be thought of as the equivalent air change rate per second. Once known, this in turn can be used, together with the ventilation and particulate deposition rate constants, k v , and k d , in equation 10, to compute the concentration of viral partials in the room space at any point in time.",
