Misclassification percentage of 19 Merianieae species with known pollinators when running models without the two most important predictive traits \"pollen expulsion mechanism\" and \"reward type\" (median error rate: 10.5%, 'buzz-bee': 28.6%, 'mixedvertebrate' (MV): 0%, 'passerine': 0%). Misclassification only occurred in the two known buzz-bee pollinated species (Adelobotrys adscendens, Graffenrieda cucullata) with morphologies very distinct from the majority of buzz-bee pollinated Merianieae, which also displayed slight classification uncertainty in the full trait dataset. Classification errors disappeared when including all 61 species which encompass additional taxa sharing these distinct morphologies. Thus, models were considered accurate enough for pollination syndrome predictions. Table S4 .

Stamens may be arranged either on one side of the flower, giving the flowers a distinct monosymmetric architecture (Meriania, Adelobotrys, Macrocentrum), or the stamens are distributed more or less regularly in the flower, leading to almost polysymmetric flowers (Graffenrieda). Anthers can be erect (Graffenrieda), bringing pores close to the stigma, or remain geniculate (the condition found in bud-stage in all species) with pores remaining close to the base of the style in the floral centre. Stamen appendages are usually very conspicuous and variable in shape, pyramidal to weakly acuminate, sometimes bearing secondary appendages, and often have strongly ornamented surfaces. Weak to strong heteranthery is found in all Adelobotrys and some Meriania species. Thecae are located on the ventral side of the connective and usually have strongly corrugated and rigid walls consisting of two cell layers and an endothecium. A septum separating the thecae into two pollen sacs is present. Pores may be located on the dorsal (Meriania, partly Adelobotrys) or ventral (Graffenrieda, Macrocentrum) side of the anther. Styles are usually exserted from the rest of the flower and often strongly curved right beneath the stigma. In many species, stigmas are small and punctiform. Flowery, pleasant scents have been noticed in some species in Meriania and Adelobotrys (ASD pers. obs.). Anthesis usually starts in the early morning and may last from a single to multiple days (ASD pers. obs.). Bees have been observed in four large flowered Meriania species orientating their bodies in parallel to individual stamens, with their head at the appendage and their abdomen pointing towards the pores. They bite into the appendage and vibrate individual stamens at a time. In smaller flowered A. adscendens, bees were seen to crouch above the entire androecium (instead of single stamens), head pointing towards the flower centre, and applying vibrations to the entire androecium.
