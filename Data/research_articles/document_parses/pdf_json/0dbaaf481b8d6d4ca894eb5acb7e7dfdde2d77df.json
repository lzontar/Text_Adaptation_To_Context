In the duckling, however, astrovirus infection is associated with hepatitis and has a mortality rate of approximately 25% in 3-6 week old ducklings, adult ducks being spared. ' Despite the association of these viruses with disease in man, few details about them are established. There are conflicting reports of the number and size of the proteins they contain, and their replication strategy and even their taxonomic status are unclear. To a large extent this is due to difficulties in growing these viruses in uitro. Recently these have been overcome, and the application of recombinant DNA technology in this area has opened new fields of study.

Furthermore, difficulties in positively identifying astrovirus particles may compound this, and some reports now indicate that astroviruses may be the second commonest cause of viral gastroenteritis in non-hospitalised patients (see below human embryo kidney (HEK) cells. In common with other enteric viruses growth was dependent on the addition of trypsin to the culture medium. Virus isolates passaged six times in HEK cells became adapted to cell culture and could be passaged in the continuous rhesus monkey cell line LLC-MK2, although trypsin was still required. Irregular supplies of primary human embryo cells limits this approach, and so the number of isolates made remains small.

In common with other such epithelia, functional asymmetry is reflected in differences in the distribution of some membrane proteins between the basolateral and apical membranes of the cells. This may include the receptors recognised by viruses and which enable them to bind to their target cells. This would induce a polarity in the initial stages of virus infection with cells being susceptible to virus on one surface but not the other. For instance, rotavirus infection of CaCo-2 cells can occur from either surface, whereas that by Semliki Forest virus is clearly olar, virus adsorbing mainly via the basolateral surface! Human astrovirus also infects CaCo-2 cells in a polar manner, infecting preferentially at the basolateral surface ( Figure 2 ). This is surprising because astrovirus would be expected to infect the apical cell surface facing into the gut lumen, the side accessible to virus in vim. However, this apparent polarity could be a consequence of the growth of the virus in vitro, and suitable receptors which are limited to the basolateral surfaces of CaCo-2 cells, might be present on the apical surfaces of differentiated intestinal villus epithelial cells.",

Reovirus serotype 1 is also known to bind to the basolateral surface of crypt cells.29 In this case it was suggested that reovirus could enter the host via the M-cells, which overlie the Peyer's patches in the gut and function to present luminal antigens to cells of the immune system located in the patches. The virus could then infect adjacent crypt cells by binding to their basolateral and not to their apical surfaces. This mechanism could be used by other enteric viruses, such as astrovirus, to gain entry to the cells lining the gut. However, this model would predict that astroviruses would infect crypt cells in viva Animal studies do not support this, and human studies are very limited. Nonetheless, infection may not be restricted to the villus tips, and duodenal biopsy during human infection has shown that human astrovirus can infect cells on the proximal part of the ~i l l u s . '~ Furthermore, unlike astrovirus, reovirus infection is limited to the crypts in vivo and is unable to spread up the villus, even though isolated intestinal epithelial cells can also bind the virus at their basolateral surfaces.

Table 1 compares the virion-associated polypeptides of ovine astrovirus?' porcine astrovirus\" and human astrovirus serotypes: and 233. Considerable variation in the protein compositions have been reported for the different astroviruses but some general features are apparent. All the astrovirus isolates contain at least two major polypeptides with M,s between 29 000 and 33 500 which often comigrate with an M , of 33 000. The porcine virus has been reported to contain larger proteins (36000-39 000) which could represent intracellular precursors since this preparation was only semi-purified. The larger molecules occasionally observed in human astrovirus have been similarly attrib~ted.~' Three of the four human isolates also contained a slightly smaller protein (M, between 20 000 and 26 500) and a smaller 13 000 protein was found in the porcine virus. This protein was seen unequivocally in those isolates in which it was detected, so its absence from some of the earlier reports for both ovine and human astrovirus is surprising. Herring and co-workers3' reported only two polypeptides (both approximately 33 000) in ovine astrovirus purified using sodium dodecyl sulphate. We have shown that similar treatment of the human astrovirus serotype I removes the 24000 protein from the virion almost completely and thus could account for its absence in earlier reports.\" There is a single report of a small 431; 132.18 Figure 2 . Polarity of infection of CaCo-2 cell monolayers by astrovirus. CaCo-2 cell monolayen were grown on porous (300 nm) membranes which provide support for the monolayer (Costar Transwell). The confluent cell monolayer then divides the culture well into two compartments separating fluid above and below the membrane. Virus inocula can then be added to medium in contact with either the apical or basolateral surfaces. Cells were then infected with human astrovirus or poliovirus (without the addition of trypsin) at either the apical or the basolateral surface. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and examined daily for the development of CPE. The monolayers were photographed through a light microscope using a x 40 (M, 5200) polypeptide in the virion,32 but in many of the examinations listed in Table 1 the polyacrylamide gel systems used would not have retained a protein of this size so the existence of this molecule has still to be confirmed. Thus, the consensus which is emerging is that the viruses may contain at least three major species of protein; two of M, approximately 29 000-33 000 and a smaller polypeptide which is more variable between strains (M, 13 000-26 500).",

Similarities in these functional regions of the genomes of different viruses could thus also provide evidence for potential relatedness between virus groups. Therefore, the 3'-NCR of the human astrovirus genome (serotype I) was compared by computer analysis with the 37 corresponding regions of several picomaviruses and caliciviruses. The resulting dendrogram is shown in Figure 3 . Astrovirus was grouped among the picomaviruses, rather than the calicivirus sequences by this procedure. The picomaviruses formed two main groups and the astrovirus 3'-NCR was grouped with those of poliovirus types 1-3, Coxsackie virus A21 and enterovirus 70 (group A). All these viruses fell within a larger cluster (groups A+B) containing all the enterovirus subgroup sequences compared, but excluding those of the rhinovirus and cardiovirus subgroups, hepatitis A and foot-and-mouth-disease virus. These formed a heterogeneous third group with the calicivirus sequences (group C).",

First, and perhaps the most obvious difference between astroviruses, caliciviruses and picomaviruses is visible by negative contrast electron microscopy. Picomaviruses are similar to astroviruses in size. However, they are invariably plain featureless spheres with some ring-like (empty) particles which have been penetrated by stain; no substructure is visible. In contrast about 10% of astroviruses bear the characteristic surface stars from which the virus derives its name. Some of these stars have five points and others six. These structures are unique and there is no satisfactory model for how they are achieved. Possession of a six-pointed star is superficially similar to the 'star of David configuration seen on some caliciviruses, but the astrovirus star lacks a central hollow, and this is a fundamental differen~e.~~ Picomavirus (reviewed by R~e c k e r t~~) and calicivirus structures48 are clearly based on an icosahedron. However, the centres of both the five and six pointed astrovirus stars appears to be an apex rather than a face.

However, it is likely that the incidence of viruses detected by EM may be biased by the relative ease with which these larger viruses can be identified in the electron microscope. They are often shed in large numbers and their characteristic size and shape make them easily recognisable. In contrast, astroviruses are more easily missed in the examination even when present in large numbers. Furthermore, there is evidence that the use of EM alone can result in the mis-classification of astroviruses. Particles showing the characteristic 'star-like' surface pattern can be identified without difficulty, but samples which contain viruses of indistinct morphology are not so readily identified. Lack of distinctive features could arise from poor preservation of structural features in the samples, or could be a fundamental property of some strains, as has been found in both rotaviruses and c a l i c i~i r u s e s .~~,~~ Indistinct viruses can only be grouped on the basis of the particle size, the determination of which can vary between laboratories, or loosely divided into two groups on the basis of whether the particles exhibit a smooth or a rough surface margin (SRVs or SRSVs). This method would group unclear astroviruses with the SRVs, and unclear caliciviruses with the SRSVs. However, to complicate matters, astroviruses may not always show the typical smoothedged appearance.
