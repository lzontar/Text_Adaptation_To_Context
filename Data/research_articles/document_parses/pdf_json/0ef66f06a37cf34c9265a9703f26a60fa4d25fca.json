The virus primarily affects the respiratory system, although other organ systems may also be involved. The respiratory presentations of COVID-19 are heterogenous ranging from minimal symptoms to significant hypoxia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The fact that a subset of patients manifest minimal symptoms complicates the attenuation of its spread. Current medical management is largely supportive without targeted therapies. This has led many countries to implement social distancing and lockdown. Amidst the pandemic of COVID-19, operating room (OR) management of patients with COVID-19 likely increases. We present a case of a pediatric patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 soon after open-heart surgery who required an urgent second surgery. The HIPPA authorization has been obtained from his parent.",

The biventricular repair occurred amidst the early phase of the local COVID-19 pandemic. Our institution had implemented policies regarding safe care of all patients who qualified for urgent or emergent surgery during the imposed restriction of routine services. At the time of this surgery, routine COVID-19 preoperative testing had not been implemented. Potential asymptomatic carrier status of pediatric patients was managed with personal protective equipment (PPE) precautions for healthcare providers and appropriate barriers for intubation ( Fig. 1 ) to minimize risk of aerosolization for all procedures. The surgery consisted of an arterial switch, pulmonary artery plasty, VSD closure with baffling of the left ventricle to the aorta, and fenestrated atrial septal defect (ASD) closure. Postoperative imaging was reassuring for adequate repair, but he came off cardiopulmonary bypass in complete heart block requiring pacing for atrioventricular synchrony with temporary pacing wires. He required minimal inotropic support and was extubated to nasal cannula on postoperative day (POD) #3.

All intubating equipment was placed inside the drapes along with the anesthesia circuit. The patient was preoxygenated and induced intravenously. The patient was masked with a two-hand technique to enable optimal seal and bagged by the assistant. Rapid sequence dose of rocuronium was administered. Once relaxation through neuromuscular blockade was achieved, anesthesia machine flows were turned off, and the patient was intubated using video laryngoscopy. After the endotracheal tube was visualized to pass through the glottis, the intubating provider inflated the cuff and the anesthesia circuit was attached. Endotracheal tube position was confirmed via visualized chest rise along with end-tidal CO 2 tracing, before the endotracheal tube was briefly clamped and an in-line suction catheter was added. A HEPA filter was attached proximal to the sampling line in the circuit to assure adequate viral filtering. Throughout the case, the patient received inotropic support with dopamine, and remained hemodynamically stable with adequate respiratory gas exchange. The patient was transported back to the ICU intubated. He was extubated on the following day to BiPAP. He was transitioned to high flow nasal cannula for two additional days, then to low flow nasal cannula. The patient was discharged home with no supplemental oxygen requirement on POD #19.",

The case-fatality rate of pediatric population was low (0-0.2%) in both China and Italy, indicating that children generally suffered from less severe disease. Our patient was asymptomatic at the time of initial surgery. Although our center has instituted routine, pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 testing now, this was not established at the time of his biventricular repair. Viral testing was obtained one day after extubation on POD#4, due to fever and worsening respiratory status. This patient had no documented SARS-CoV-2 exposure. With an incubation period of 2-14 days, it is highly possible that the patient was infected prior to the surgery. Many patients with palliated congenital heart disease have respiratory symptoms at baseline, making it difficult to reliably differentiate COVID-19-related symptoms from cardiac-related symptoms. Routine testing might address this concern.",

Optimal timing of surgical implantation of permanent pacemaker was considered by judging whether the peak of severity had passed. D-dimer was increasing on POD#10-11, but the other inflammatory markers were improving in keeping with his clinical course, which led us to proceed surgery on POD#11. The endothelium, which regulates coagulation, expresses ACE2 -a target protein for SARS-CoV-2. Increased D-dimer was in parallel with an increase in platelet and fibrinogen levels, suggesting that the patient was in a procoagulant state as reported in a subset of COVID-19 patients [12] .
