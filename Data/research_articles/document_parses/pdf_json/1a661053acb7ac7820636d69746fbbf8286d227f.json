Patients were included in the analysis if they were 18 years of age or older, had confirmed COVID-19, and were admitted to an intensive care unit from March 11 to April 29, 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed by reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction assays of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Data were abstracted manually from electronic and paper-based health records. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured on admission by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV/ VIS).",

It may induce Toll-like receptor expression and inhibit neutrophil function, decrease vascular dilation, and increase permeability [4] . Furthermore, it can cause direct glycosylation of proteins, thereby altering the structure of complement, and may cause a cytokine storm [4, 5] . Recent data demonstrating viral particles in endothelial cells of several organs suggest \"endotheliitis\" as a possible mechanism of organ dysfunction leading to critical illness in COVID-19 patients which may be aggravated by endothelial Abbreviations: IQR interquartile range, BMI body mass index, HbA1c glycated hemoglobin, CRP C-reactive protein, IL-6 interleukin-6, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 *If specified in the patients' health records dysfunction associated with prediabetes and diabetes [6] . More pronounced peak levels of inflammation observed in our patients with abnormal HbA1c may support such an assumption. In conclusion, we recommend routine measurement of HbA1c in hospitalized COVID-19 patients for additional risk stratification, because most patients of our cohort were previously not diagnosed with having impaired glucose tolerance.
