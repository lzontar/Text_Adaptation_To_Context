At the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, in an attempt to increase the number of patients who are eligible for aggressive surgical removal or destruction of tumors, we now perform RFA in combination with hepatic resection. Despite the theoretical appeal of combination therapy, there is some concern in the surgical community that the addition of an ablative therapy to a major hepatic resection would be unsafe and add significant complexity to an already demanding operation. Additionally, there is concern that patients with traditionally unresectable disease represent a population of patients who have a larger tumor burden associated with biologically more aggressive disease and an inherently poorer prognosis. Performing a potentially morbid procedure (such as a resection with RFA) would be unwarranted if it could not lead to meaningful longterm survival in a subset of patients. In reviewing the literature, there have been occasional reports of RFA being used as an adjunct to resection, but these studies have included only small numbers of patients. 40, 41 The current study represents the largest series of patients reported to date who have been treated simultaneously with hepatic resection and RFA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1381, "end": 1384, "text": "40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1387, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FIG. 2."}, {"text": "This study was performed to address the question of feasibility and safety concerning the use of combined hepatic resection and RFA applications.

The complication rate for hepatic resection and RFA was 19.8%, which is comparable to the 11% to 35% morbidity rates reported for hepatic resection alone. 42, 43 Most of the complications were minor or intermediate, including urinary tract infections, bilomas, or abscesses that were amenable to percutaneous drainage. Serious complications were less common, but when they did occur they were strongly associated with mortality. Overall the perioperative mortality rate was 2.3%, which again compares favorably to reported rates of 0% to 3% for hepatic resection alone. 42, 43 It appears, therefore, that hepatic resection combined with RFA is safe and well tolerated. A review of the perioperative deaths, however, mandates a cautionary note. Two deaths were associated with liver failure, subsequent multisystem organ failure and death. These patients serve to emphasize that although combined therapy appears to be safe in the majority of cases, resection combined with thermal destruction of too great a volume of liver may lead to liver failure and death.

On univariate anal-ysis, the amount of blood loss did seem to affect overall survival with patients experiencing \u03fe 1000 cc blood loss having a significantly decreased median survival.

Previously studies have shown that RFA for noncolorectal hepatic metastases can be effective if the patient population is chosen carefully. 9, 40, 44 In the present study, on univariate analysis, those patients with noncolorectal metastases had a statistically significant better median survival as compared to those patients with colorectal metastases. This may be related to selection bias. The therapeutic threshold for operating on noncolorectal hepatic metastasis is considerably higher than that for colorectal disease. Most patients with noncolorectal liver metastases have been heavily pretreated with systemic or regional chemotherapy and have been followed for a period of time in order to document stable isolated hepatic disease. In contrast, colorectal patients are more likely to undergo resection sooner, without a period of time to monitor the stability of their disease. Thus, colorectal patients may be more likely to harbor unsuspected regional or distant micrometastatic disease that becomes clinically evident months or years after an operation. Our data supports the safety of an appropriately aggressive treatment plan for patients with both colorectal and noncolorectal hepatic metastasis.

Resection or local destruction of tumor can produce long-term disease-free and overall survival in a subset of patients but cannot overcome the tumor biology in patients who already have micrometastatic disease at the time of their surgical therapy. Thus, even though we had a RFA site failure rate of only 2.3%, recurrent disease developed in over one-half of the patients after combined resection and RFA. In the current study, multivariate analysis revealed that a total number of tumors \u03fe10 was significantly associated with a short time to recurrence (\u03fd3.0 months). Patients with \u03fe10 tumors clearly represent a cohort of patients with a significant tumor burden who may be more likely to harbor micrometastatic disease.

RFA of a tumor \u03fe3 cm in diameter was a significant factor on multivariate analysis with these patients having a higher likelihood of death from cancer recurrence than those who underwent ablation of a lesion \u05453 cm (HR \u03ed 1.85, CI \u03ed 1.02-3.37, P \u03ed .04). Previous studies have also shown a correlation between lesion size, recurrence risk, and survival. We do not recommend abandoning combined hepatic resection and RFA of lesions \u03fe 3 cm, but this data does show that there is an increased risk of failure in this subset of patients. This may be because RFA of lesions \u03fe3 cm in diameter requires more experience and creation of multiple overlapping zones of thermal necrosis is usually required. For this reason, hepatic resection combined with RFA should be performed by those who have expertise in both techniques. Due to the inherent learning curve associated with RFA, one should initially attempt ablation of smaller lesions before undertaking more complex larger lesions.

Although this was found to be significant in univariate analysis, in the multivariate model, it did not withstand competing risk adjustment but a trend did persist (P \u03ed .13). This finding is at odds with traditional reports showing that patients with synchronous lesions tend to have a relatively poor survival probability. Although we do not have a clear explanation for this finding in the current study, it may be related to patient selection and pretreatment bias. The majority of our patients who developed metachronous colorectal liver metastases did so after receiving adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based systemic therapy after resection of their primary colorectal cancer. Thus, they had already failed one chemotherapy regimen and had fewer subsequent treatment options. In contrast, patients with synchronous liver metastases underwent resection of their primary cancer followed by three drug-combined systemic chemotherapy (IFL: irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin) both before and after liver resection and RFA.

Local recurrence rates at RFA sites treated using intraoperative ultrasound-guided therapy with multiple overlapping zones of thermal treatment is uncommon. Regional or distant recurrence of disease is the more frequent pattern of failure. We demonstrated that tumor burden influences the time to recurrence, but age, gender, histological type, RFA lesion size, and the type of resection performed do not. At a median follow-up of 21.3 months, 65.2% of patients were still alive for a median actuarial survival of 44.5 months. It is difficult to compare objectively resection plus RFA results with other modalities such as RFA alone or resection alone because of the differences in the patient populations treated. Nevertheless, our data is provocative as it suggests that even patients with multifocal, liver-only, but otherwise unresectable liver cancer may derive a significant survival benefit from combined hepatic resection and RFA. The selection of such patients is critical and results of this nonrandomized, retrospective study must be corroborated by further clinical trials. Further studies will also be needed to evaluate the impact of combining liver resection and RFA on patient quality of life.
