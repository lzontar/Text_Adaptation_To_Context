We obtained paired nasopharyngeal swabs and deep endotracheal aspirates from these participants (the so-called PICU cohort) between Sept 10, 2013, and Sept 4, 2016. We also did a matched case-control study (1:2) with the same inclusion criteria in children with LRTIs at three Dutch teaching hospitals and in age-matched, sex-matched, and time-matched healthy children recruited from the community. Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained at admission for cases and during home visits for controls. Data for child characteristics were obtained by questionnaires and from pharmacy printouts and medical charts. We used quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA-based sequencing to establish viral and bacterial microbiota profiles, respectively. We did sparse random forest classifier analyses on the bacterial data, viral data, metadata, and the combination of all three datasets to distinguish cases from controls.",

Classically, LRTIs are caused by acquisition in the upper respiratory tract of pathogenic viruses and bacteria, which replicate and spread towards the lower respiratory tract, where they invade the mucosa, leading to inflammation and clinical disease. 4 Many of these microorganisms are, however, pathobionts, and are frequently encountered in the upper respiratory tract of healthy children too. 5 We therefore hypothesised that a balanced microbial community protects patho bionts from causing LRTIs.",

We have reported that oral microbes such as Prevotella and Leptotrichia spp in the nasopharyngeal niche were strongly associated with subsequent development of upper respiratory tract infections in children and were more abundant during these infections. 8 By contrast, Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum spp were associated with resistance to symptomatic respiratory disease during the first year of life and were less abundant during upper respiratory tract infections. 8 Additionally, in infants with LRTIs caused by respiratory syncytial virus, increased presence of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae was strongly associated with increased severity of host inflammation, suggesting an important role for the complete microbiota of the upper respiratory tract and the symptomology of clinical disease. 9 No case-control study has yet addressed the relation between the nasopharyngeal microbiota and the presence, clinical symptoms, and severity of childhood LRTIs. Furthermore, the profiling of nasopharyngeal microbiota has never been studied in the context of classification of states of health and disease. We aimed to investigate the association between upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota during childhood LRTI, the use of microbiota to predict the presence and severity of LRTIs, and the associations between microbiota and disease across different clinical presentations of LRTI.",

One study, which focused only on infants at high risk of atopy, showed that specific microbiota profiles were associated with the development of respiratory infections. A second small (n=100) matched case-control study showed that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were associated with cases, whereas no specific taxon was associated with controls. However, the study was underpowered to provide conclusive results. The third study included infants younger than 1 year only, and did not include a control group of healthy children.

Corynebacterium propinquum (4) Corynebacterium macginleyi/accolens (8) Staphylococcus aureus/ epidermidis (7) Actinobacillus porcinus (13) Veillonella dispar (24) 19, 20 micro biota profiles between nasopharyngeal and endotracheal aspirate samples in patients with LRTI admitted to a PICU. The Bray-Curtis similarity of 0\u00b761 approximates that of biological replicates (ie, two sequentially obtained lavages from the same lung lobe of the same child) of microbiota profiles of the lungs. 20 This finding suggests not only that the upper Associated with disease Associated with health respiratory microbiota is the source for the lower respiratory tract, but also that, except for a few commensal species, microbial colonisation and proliferation in the nasopharynx parallels that in the lower airways during childhood LRTIs. Therefore, our findings support the idea that upper respiratory tract samples can be used as a proxy for lung microbiota in childhood LRTIs. Next, in our unselected, strictly matched case-control cohort, we showed a strong association between nasopharyngeal microbiota composition and the presence of childhood LRTIs. Viral presence was ubiquitous in both cases and controls, with respiratory syncytial virus and, to a lesser extent, human metapneumovirus, highly overrepresented in cases, in line with the results of studies of the viral causes of childhood LRTIs. 21 The presence and abundance of Haemophilus spp, S pneumoniae, and oral species were strongly associated with disease, in line with previous reports linking these taxa to susceptibility to, and severity of, respiratory tract infections in children. 6, 7, 22, 23 By contrast, the abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria like Moraxella, Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum, and Helcococcus spp were underrepresented in cases, in line with previous reports connecting these genera with prevention of infections. 6, 7, 12, 24 By combining viral, bacterial, and host-related predictors, we were able to differentiate children with LRTIs from strictly matched healthy controls. The accuracy of prediction of infection was greatly diminished when individual predictors were used, underlining the multifactorial pathophysiology of childhood LRTIs. The contribution of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, both bacterial and viral, seems to be largely independent of clinical presentation, and even holds for bronchiolitis and wheezing illness, which are generally assumed to have a viral cause. 25 Results from our case-control study were confirmed independently in a second cohort, which showed that Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum were nearly absent in children with LRTIs admitted to the PICU, suggesting that these children especially had reduced resistance to overgrowth and dissemination of pathobionts to the lungs. 5 Furthermore, in post-hoc analyses, oral species were associated with both the decision to treat with antibiotics and with duration of hospitalisation, which suggests that the abundance of these species is associated with the severity of LRTIs. 26 A possible mechanism is that Gram-negative oral bacteria promote a pro-inflammatory mucosal response, 27 leading to an increase in catecho lamines that in turn accelerates the growth of these same Gram-negative oral species and of potential pathogens such as Haemophilus spp and S pneumoniae. 28, 29 Therefore, it would be interesting to study whether prescribing antibiotics on the basis of the abundance of oral bacteria in respiratory specimens would improve outcomes.",

First, the accuracy of our model in discriminating LRTIs from health suggests that microbiota-based diagnostics might have potential clinical application. Diagnostics for the detection of potentially pathogenic viruses and bacteria cover only some pathobionts and discriminate poorly between asymptomatic colonisation and causes of symptomatic disease. If a microbiota-based diagnostic or classification tool could improve accuracy and discriminatory power, it would have major implications for treatment protocols. A proof-of-principle study of rapid microbiota-based diagnosis (<12 h) of severe pneumonia in adults showed that such diagnostic tools improve diagnostic accuracy and could be clinically applied. 30 If the cost of such technology decreases further and becomes available for paediatric use, use of broadspectrum antibiotics could be avoided more often, and the most abundant or overgrowing species could be targeted with narrow-spectrum drugs. 31 Although our microbiota-based approach has to be validated in independent cohorts, the similar performance of the genus-level model suggests potential for future development of universal or country-based or region-based models for the prediction of severity and duration of disease by combined microbiota and host character istics. Such a model would potentially allow physicians to increase or decrease the threshold for antimicrobial treatment depending on the predicted outcome.",

Our findings also allude to the hypothesis that there is a universal pathway for the development of clinical LRTIs, linked to microbial dysbiosis, whereby clinical pheno types are driven more by host (eg age, anatomy, baseline mucosal inflammation, status of innate and adaptive immunity, genetic background) and environ mental characteristics rather than by single pathogen characteristics. Thus, treatment decisions should not be based on clinical phenotype but rather on disease severity. This scientific debate is only beginning, and, in addition to confirmatory studies of our results, many discussions among and between clinicians, microbiologists, and biologists need to take place.

Furthermore, the unselected recruitment of cases should have given us a cohort that is highly representative of the patients treated by paediatric clinicians, and the consistent patterns in our unsupervised (ie, hierarchical clustering) and supervised (ie, metagenomeSeq) analyses contribute to the robustness of our results. Our study also has limitations. First, casecontrol designs could theoretically introduce selection bias that could affect the validity and reproducibility of our results. Second, quantitative PCR-based assays detect only known respiratory viruses rather than the entire respiratory virome. However, virome studies report a high concordance between the results of metagenomic sequencing and quantitative PCR-based assays. 41 Third, as with any observational study, our findings do not necessarily prove causality. Longitudinal analyses are underway to address the causality of respiratory microbiota in respiratory disease. Fourth, endotracheal aspirate might not perfectly reflect the lower respiratory tract microbiota extending into the bronchi and alveoli. That said, clinical evidence based on conventional microbiology data has suggested that tracheal aspirates are a good proxy for the lower respiratory tract, and therefore an appropriate proxy for the clinical diagnosis of cause of disease in children with severe LRTIs. 42 Furthermore, data published in 2017 showed a strong concordance with negligible differences between bacterial microbiota from endotracheal samples and those from bronchial lavages. 43 Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing permits annotation up to the in between genus-level and species-level identification of bacteria, but does not provide the resolution of metagenomic techniques (eg, shotgun sequencing), especially for closely related species, such as streptococcal species. We tried to provide some species-level data by using quantitative PCR to confirm four common and potentially pathogenic OTUs, and these findings supported our conclusions. However, future studies might be needed on multiple levels to further confirm our data and refine the conclusions.",

In (B)-(F), the x-axis shows the importance of the variable to the accuracy of the model, which was estimated by calculating the mean decrease in Gini after randomly permuting the values of each given variable (mean and SD, 100 replicates); the direction of the associations was estimated post hoc with point biserial correlations. Because multiple OTUs of individual bacterial species were identified, we refer to OTUs by their taxonomical annotations and a rank number (shown in parentheses), which is based on the abundance of each given OTU.
