Presymptomatic transmission was the only possible explanation for the transmission from patient 4 to patient 5. It was also a possibility in the transmission from patient 5 to patient 8 and could not be ruled out for the household clusters (ie, transmission from patient 5 to patients 11 and 6 and transmission from patient 11 to patient 9) or transmission from patient 7 to patient 14. Patients 4 and 5 had symptom onset on the same day, which is only plausible if patient 4 shed virus 2 days before symptom onset and patient 5 had a 2day incubation period. Four transmission events occurred certainly on the day of symptom onset (from patient 3 to patient 12, from patient 5 to patient 7, from patient 7 to patient 10, and from patient 7 or 8 to patient 16) and for one transmission event (patient 5 to patient 8), the only other possibility is presymptomatic transmission (table 1; figure) . Five patients were possibly infected when they had contact with their source case at the day of the source case's symptom onset (patients 5 to 8, 5 to 11, 5 to 6, 11 to 9, and 7 to 14; table). Transmission during the prodromal phase of the illness occurred from patient 0 to patients 1, 2, and 4, as well as from patient 3 to patient 12. The incubation period ranged from 1 to 7 days.

Due to the particular setting centred around a business company with encounters tractable through electronic calendars, the timing and setting of most contact events were well defined.

This might explain a rather short median incubation period of 4\u00b70 days in our study, which is substantially shorter than the 5\u00b72 days calculated from data of the first 425 confirmed cases in China 11 but similar to the findings of Guan and colleagues. 12 For comparison, the incubation period for SARS was 6\u00b74 days, with a range of 1-14 days. 13 The short incubation period combined with a median serial interval of the same length correspond to transmission early in the course of disease, or even before disease onset, which is corroborated by studies of viral shedding in the same patients. 8 Highlevel replication with frequent virus isolation from the pharynx stands by contrast with the SARS coronavirusgenetically similar to SARSCoV2-that was shed at lower concentrations from the upper respiratory tract and was effectively transmitted roughly a week after symptom onset. 11 This delayed shedding in SARS caused substantial problems with the sensitivity of RTPCR based on upper respiratory tract swabs. In our study, two tests from patient 11 came back negative although the patient had already developed symptoms, suggesting that these results were false negative.

The secondary attack rate thereby decreases with the intensity of contact: among members of the cohorted household, the secondary attack rate was 75%, but decreased to 10% among household contacts that were only together until isolation of the case. Although the experience with the cohorted family is based on a single observation, it shows the high risk of close household contacts-ie, sharing a room-of a case in home isolation and calls for strong measures within households to prevent transmission, particularly if susceptible people are present. Among 217 non household highrisk contacts that were cumulatively followed up because of direct contact with a confirmed case, 11 were infected. The resulting secondary attack rate of 5% seems low, indicating little spread in this cluster. However, more effective spread of the virus might have been prevented by the proactive quarantine of highrisk contacts later identified as cases while still being presymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, as well as the proactive closure of the affected company. Trans mission originating from people with more distinct respiratory symptoms might have resulted in a higher number of secondary cases. Although two patients developed signs of pneumonia later in the course of disease, all others had a light course of disease and all patients recovered fully. 8 However, it should be taken into account that the outbreak occurred in a population of workingage, generally healthy individuals. The overall clinical picture might have been different in a population including older individuals, or those with underlying chronic diseases. Another limitation of our study is that, naturally, not all infectious encounters could be reconstructed. Because the company held larger business and social events during the exposure period, it is possible that an infectious case might have met a successor case so briefly that neither of the two remembered the encounter.
