Second, our study was not designed to identify reasons for non-response. These reasons may be numerous, such as the lack of interest or concern, but also a limited access to the Internet or poor understanding of the questions asked. The latter could help explain the gap between the number of individual connections and the number of completed questionnaires, which was observed for each of the SPIRE studies. However, we had tested the questionnaire among volunteers, before launching each survey. In addition, we decided to ask a limited number of very simple questions (Figure 1) . Language barriers were unlikely as the vast majority of passengers of flights between mainland France and French West Indies are French-speaking, French citizens. The very low yield of OHQ in this study may also be, in Comparing our results to others' is not an easy task as we failed to identify any other study that used the same strategy as ours.
