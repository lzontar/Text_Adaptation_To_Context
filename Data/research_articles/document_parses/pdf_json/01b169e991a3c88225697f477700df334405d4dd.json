We report our experience with 22 kidney transplant recipients followed at our academic center in Belgium, in whom we applied a standard strategy of immunosuppression minimization and treatment. Clinical symptoms were similar to those reported in the general population. Among kidney transplant recipients hospitalized with COVID-19, 11% died.

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus and primarily manifests as an acute respiratory illness with interstitial and alveolar pneumonia, but can affect multiple organs, such as heart, kidney, digestive tract, blood and central nervous system. 1 As of April 18, 2020, 2,338,335 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in more than 185 countries and territories and at least 161,030 deaths have been reported so far. 2 In Belgium, the first case of COVID-19 in the general population was diagnosed on 4th February 2020. To date, more than 42,000 cases have been reported, including over 12,000 hospitalizations. 3 Specific questions arise for transplant patients who are facing COVID -19 infection. As with other infections, could the risk of acquiring COVID-19 be increased due to the chronic state of immunosuppression? Will the infection be more severe than in patients with normal immunity? Moreover, how should immunosuppressive therapy be handled in that context?",

However, in past epidemics with MERS and SARS-Cov-1 this increased risk was not observed. 22 As in the general population 1 , the most common symptoms in our cohort of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection were fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. As already reported 5,23,24 , we also observed some atypical presentations with predominant digestive symptoms and acute confusion. Interestingly, the severity of pulmonary involvement at the chest CT-scan at admission was not associated with worse clinical outcome. Indeed, some patients with images of severe pulmonary involvement recovered quite well while the only patient currently in ICU had moderate involvement at admission with subsequent dramatic evolution. This suggests that chest CT-scan at admission is useful for diagnosis but does not provide prognostic information. However, other factors may impact the severity of the pulmonary involvement on the first chest CTscan such as the time interval between the onset of symptoms and the CT-scan and the presence of underlying chronic pulmonary diseases. Little is known about early markers that may predict the clinical evolution. Tan et al. recently showed that CRP increased early in severe COVID-19 infection, prior to CT findings 25 , suggesting that the initial evolution of CRP levels might provide more prognostic information than early CT scan.",

Early reports suggest a role for hydroxychloroquine in reducing the viral load. 32 However, the impact of hydroxychloroquine on the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients is largely unknown and highly debated. Even if hydroxychloroquine was safely used in our cohort, we cannot draw any conclusion regarding its efficacy because of the absence of a control group. The currently recruiting DISCOVERY and SOLIDARITY trials (NCT04315948 and NCT04321616, respectively) will provide some answers regarding treatment efficacy in the general population. The results of these trials will then need to be extrapolated to the kidney transplant recipients population. None of our patient received the antivirals currently in the pipeline 33 days after the tocilizumab administration. 15 In our cohort, the kidney function outcome was satisfactory. Although 28% of hospitalized patients experienced AKI, none required hemodialysis. Moreover, kidney function rapidly stabilized after appropriate hydration. To date, we have not observed any acute rejection episodes, but the current follow-up of our patients is short. As there is a correlation between immunosuppression reduction and increased risk of acute rejection 35 , appropriate monitoring of kidney function should be continued and reintroduction of immunosuppressive drugs should be tailored after infection recovery.",

Management was not uniform as in our series, as immunosuppression reduction and hydroxychloroquine use was used in 86%, and patients also received Azithromycin (46%), the CCR5 inhibitor leronlimab (21%) and tocilizumab (7%). Interestingly, while kidney transplant recipients from this cohort seem quite similar to ours regarding co-morbidities, the outcome appears more severe with 11 kidney transplant recipients (39%) requiring mechanical ventilation and 6 (21%) requiring kidney replacement therapy. The mortality rate was also higher at the end of follow-up (28% vs 11% in our patients). A possible explanation might be the ethnic origin of the patients in that cohort, as 39% and 42% were black and Hispanic, respectively, which differs from our population. These differences in disease severity and outcomes between centers and countries will need to be closely analyzed in larger cohorts with longer follow-up.",

Both patients (patient 7 and patient 8) who died from COVID19 infection also presented with very severe comorbidities: the first one had metastatic uterine carcinoma and was terminally ill, and the second one suffered from severe active sclerodermia associated with very impaired general health status which had been deteriorating over the past months. Both patients were considered terminally ill and died in palliative care units. The rate of death of hospitalized COVID-19 kidney transplant recipients in our cohort is 11.1% (2/18).The severity of pulmonary parenchyma involvement on the CT-scan performed at admission did not seem to influence outcome.

Of course, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to assess how immunosuppression should be reduced and how to resume it after remission. One important question is the optimal management of kidney transplant recipients who are receiving a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi)-based regimen. Though mTORi are known to reduce the risk of developing Cytomegalovirus or BK virus infections after kidney transplantation29 , their impact on SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently unknown. mTORi are believed to lead to a proinflammatory status by increasing the production of some cytokines, including interleukins (IL)-12, IL-6, , IL-1, IL-23), and TNF \u03b1. Thus, the mTORi capacity to boost the deleterious inflammatory response involved in COVID-19 is an important yet unresolved question. In this context, some guidelines26,27 have advocated withdrawing mTORi in all COVID-19 kidney transplant recipients requiring hospitalization. In our cohort, 3 (16.6%) out of the 18 hospitalized kidney transplant recipients had mTORibased immunosuppression. mTORi was reduced, but maintained, in two patients (patient 2 and patient 13) who finally recovered. By contrast, mTORi was stopped the day patient 18 was admitted in ICU. He is so far the only patient who has developed such a severe pulmonary illness. Factors associated with worse respiratory outcomes still need to be identified. In patient 18, besides mTORi, comorbidities and past history of cancer might have put him at risk of untoward evolution. Genetic background such as human leukocyte antigen polymorphisms or angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism could also be implicated in the individual response to infection; their precise identification will probably shed some light on how to better handle infection in high-risks populations.30.31",

Pereira et al 36 recently reported a two-center experience of 90 solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19, including 46 kidney transplant recipients. Among the kidney transplant recipients, 12 had a severe disease defined as a need for mechanical ventilation, ICU admission or death. The general management was quite similar to ours with immunosuppression reduction (88%) and the use of hydroxychloroquine (91%). Sixteen patients from the entire cohort (24%) had died by the end of follow-up. Although this report provides a broad picture of COVID-19 infection in solid organ transplant recipients, it does not focus on kidney transplant recipients, making it difficult to compare with our population.. Akalin et al 37 also published a US case-series including 36",

A standard strategy of immunosuppression minimization and treatment was applied, with a mortality rate for kidney transplant recipients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection of 11%. Further studies with a higher number of patients and longer follow-up are required to better assess the optimal management and outcomes of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19.
