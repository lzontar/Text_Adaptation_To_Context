Such major viral outbreaks demand early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 virus genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 virus genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing (MLDSP) for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 29 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that are known to contain some of the largest viral genomes, up to around 32 kbp in length [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . After increases in the number of coronavirus genome sequences available following efforts to investigate the diversity in similarities, their application can be challenging in many cases [45, 46] . It is realistically impossible to analyze thousands of complete genomes using alignment-based methods due to the heavy computation time. Moreover, the alignment demands the sequences to be continuously homologous which is not always the case. Alignment-free methods [47 -51] have been proposed in the past as an alternative to address the limitations of the alignment-based methods. Comparative genomics beyond alignment-based approaches have benefited from the computational power of machine learning. Machine learning-based alignment-free methods have also been used successfully for a variety of problems including virus classification [49] [50] [51] . An alignment-free approach [49] was proposed for subtype classification of HIV-1 genomes and achieved *97% classification accuracy. MLDSP [50] , with the use of a broad range of 1D numerical representations of DNA sequences, has also achieved very high levels of classification accuracy with viruses. Even rapidly evolving, plastic genomes of viruses such as Influenza and Dengue are classified down to the level of strain and subtype, respectively with 100% classification accuracy. MLDSP-GUI [51] provides an option to use 2D Chaos Game Representation (CGR) [52] as numerical representation of DNA sequences. CGR's have a longstanding use in species classification with identification of biases in sequence composition [48, 51, 52] . MLDSP-GUI has shown 100% classification accuracy for Flavivirus genus to species classification using 2D CGR as numerical representation [51] . MLDSP and MLDSP-GUI have demonstrated the ability to identify the genomic signatures (a species-specific pattern known to be pervasive throughout the genome) with species level accuracy that can be used for sequence (dis)similarity analyses. In this study, we use MLDSP [50] and MLDSP-GUI [51] with CGR as a numerical representation of DNA sequences to assess the classification of the COVID-19 virus from the perspective of machine learning-based alignment-free whole genome comparison of genomic signatures. Using MLDSP and MLDSP-GUI, we confirm that the COVID-19 virus belongs to the Betacoronavirus, while its genomic similarity to the sub-genus Sarbecovirus supports a possible bat origin. This paper demonstrates how machine learning using intrinsic genomic signatures can provide rapid alignment-free taxonomic classification of novel pathogens. Our method delivers accurate classifications of the COVID-19 virus without a priori biological knowledge, by a simultaneous processing of the geometric space of all relevant viral genomes.

All of the available viral sequences were downloaded from the Virus-Host DB (14688 sequences available on January 14, 2020). Virus-Host DB covers the sequences from the NCBI RefSeq (release 96, September 9, 2019) and GenBank (release 233.0, August 15, 2019).

Accession numbers for all the sequences used in this study can be found in S1 File of S2 and S3 Tables. MLDSP [50] and MLDSP-GUI [51] were used as the machine learning-based alignmentfree methods for complete genome analyses. As MLDSP-GUI is an extension of the MLDSP methodology, we will refer to the method hereafter as MLDSP-GUI. Each genomic sequence is mapped into its respective genomic signal (a discrete numeric sequence) using a numerical representation. For this study, we use a two-dimensional k-mer (oligomers of length k) based numerical representation known as Chaos Game Representation (CGR) [52] . The k-mer value 7 is used for all the experiments. The value k = 7 achieved the highest accuracy scores for the HIV-1 subtype classification [49] and this value could be relevant for other virus related analyses. The magnitude spectra are then calculated by applying Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the genomic signals [50] . A pairwise distance matrix is then computed using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) [53] as a distance measure between magnitude spectra. The distance matrix is used to generate the 3D Molecular Distance Maps (MoDMap3D) [54] by applying the classical Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) [55] . MoDMap3D represents an estimation of the relationship among sequences based on the genomic distances between the sequences. The feature vectors are constructed from the columns of the distance matrix and are used as an input to train six supervised-learning based classification models (Linear Discriminant, Linear SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine KNN, Subspace Discriminant, and Subspace KNN) [50] . A 10-fold cross-validation is used to train, and test the classification models and the average of 10 runs is reported as the classification accuracy. The trained machine learning models are then used to test the COVID-19 virus sequences. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) [56] and neighbor-joining [57] phylogenetic trees are also computed using the pairwise distance matrix.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 969, "end": 973, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 988, "end": 992, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1470, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1614, "end": 1618, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1800, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1895, "end": 1899, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2031, "end": 2035, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2098, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2487, "end": 2491, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2795, "end": 2799, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2821, "end": 2825, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Materials and methods"}, {"text": "In this paper, MLDSP-GUI is augmented by a decision tree approach to the supervised machine learning component and a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. The decision tree parallels the taxonomic classification levels, and is necessary so as to minimize the number of calls to the supervised classifier module, as well as to maintain a reasonable number of clusters during each supervised training session. For validation of MLDSP-GUI results using CGR as a numerical representation, we use Spearman's rank correlation coefficient [58] [59] [60] [61] , as follows. The frequency of each k-mer is calculated in each genome. Due to differences in genome length between species, proportional frequencies are computed by dividing each k-mer frequency by the length of the respective sequence. To determine whether there is a correlation between k-mer frequencies in COVID-19 virus genomes and specific taxonomic groups, a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient test is conducted for k = 1 to k = 7.

Prior to intermediary cross-species infection, the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were also thought to have originated in bats [24, 25, 34, [68] [69] [70] .

Sampling additional animals at the market and wildlife in the surrounding area may help elucidate whether intermediary species were involved or not, as was possible with the SARS-CoV. Viral outbreaks like COVID-19 demand timely analysis of genomic sequences to guide the research in the right direction. This problem being time-sensitive requires quick sequence similarity comparison against thousands of known sequences to narrow down the candidates of possible origin. Alignment-based methods are known to be time-consuming and can be challenging in cases where homologous sequence continuity cannot be ensured. It is challenging (and sometimes impossible) for alignment-based methods to compare a large number of sequences that are too different in their composition. Alignment-free methods have been used successfully in the past to address the limitations of the alignment-based methods [48] [49] [50] [51] . The alignment-free approach is quick and can handle a large number of sequences. Moreover, even the sequences coming from different regions with different compositions can be easily compared quantitatively, with equally meaningful results as when comparing homologous/ similar sequences. We use MLDSP-GUI (a variant of MLDSP with additional features), a machine learning-based alignment-free method successfully used in the past for sequence comparisons and analyses [50] . The main advantage alignment-free methodology offers is the ability to analyze large datasets rapidly. In this study we confirm the taxonomy of the COVID-19 virus and, more generally, propose a method to efficiently analyze and classify a novel unclassified DNA sequence against the background of a large dataset.

No realm is defined for the remaining 11 families. The objective is to train the classification models with the known viral genomes and then predict the labels of the COVID-19 virus sequences. The maximum classification accuracy score of 95% was obtained using the Quadratic SVM model. This test demonstrates that MLDSP-GUI can distinguish between different viral families. The trained models are then used to predict the labels of 29 COVID-19 virus sequences.

MLDSP-GUI distinguishes sequences at the sub-genus level with a maximum classification accuracy score of 98.4%, obtained using the Quadratic SVM model. All of the classification models trained on the dataset in Test-4 predicted the label of all 29 COVID-19 virus sequences as Sarbecovirus. This suggests substantial similarity between the COVID-19 virus and the Sarbecovirus sequences. Test-5 and Test-6 (see Table 3 ) are designed to verify that the COVID-19 virus sequences can be differentiated from the known species in the Betacoronavirus genus. MLDSP-GUI achieved a maximum classification score of 98.7% for Test-5 and 100% for Test-6 using Subspace Discriminant classification model. This shows that although the COVID-19 virus and Sarbecovirus are closer on the basis of genomic similarity (Test-4), they are still distinguishable from known species. Therefore, these results suggest that the COVID-19 virus may represent a genetically distinct species of Sarbecovirus. All the COVID-19 virus sequences are visually seen in MoDMap3D generated from Test-5 (see Fig 2(b) ) as a closely packed cluster and it supports a fact that there is 99% similarity among these sequences [12, 31] .

To confirm this proximity, UPGMA and neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees are computed from the PCC-based pairwise distance matrix of sequences in Test-6, see Figs 3 and 4. Notably, the UPGMA model assumes that all lineages are evolving at a constant rate (equal evolution rate among branches). This method may produce unreliable results in cases where the genomes of some lineages evolve more rapidly than those of the others. To further verify the phylogenetic relationships, we also produced a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining method that allows different evolution rates among branches and obtained a highly similar output. The phylogenetic trees placed the RaTG13 sequence closest to the COVID-19 virus sequences, followed by the bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 sequences.

Vertebrate genomes are known to have an under-representation of CG dinucleotides in their genomes, otherwise known as CG suppression [82, 83] . This feature is thought to have been due to the accumulation of spontaneous deamination mutations of methyl-cytosines over time [82] . As viruses are obligate parasites, evolution of viral genomes is intimately tied to the biology of their hosts [84] . As host cells develop strategies such as RNA interference and restriction-modification systems to prevent and limit viral infections, viruses will continue to counteract these strategies [83] [84] [85] . Dinucleotide composition and biases are pervasive across the genome and make up a part of the organism's genomic signature [84] . These host genomes have evolutionary pressures that shape the host genomic signature, such as the pressure to eliminate CG dinucleotides within protein coding genes in humans [83] . Viral genomes have been shown to mimic the same patterns of the hosts, including single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, which suggests that many RNA viruses can evolve to mimic the same features of their host's genes and genomic signature [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . As genomic composition, specifically in mRNA, can be used as a way of discriminating self vs non-self RNA, the viral genomes are likely shaped by the same pressures that influence the host genome [83] . One such pressure on DNA and RNA is the APOBEC family of enzymes, members of which are known to cause G to A mutations [86] [87] [88] . While these enzymes primarily work on DNA, it has been demonstrated that these enzymes can also target RNA viral genomes [87] . The APOBEC enzymes therefore have RNA editing capability and may help contribute to the innate defence system against various RNA viruses [86] . This could therefore have a direct impact on the genomic signature of RNA viruses. Additional mammalian mechanisms for inhibiting viral RNA have been highlighted for retroviruses with the actions of zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) [82] . ZAP targets CG dinucleotide sequences, and in vertebrate host cells with the CG suppression in host genomes, this can serve as a mechanism for the distinction of self vs non-self RNA and inhibitory consequences [82] . Coronaviruses have A/U rich and C/G poor genomes, which over time may have been, in part, a product of cytidine deamination and selection against CG dinucleotides [89] [90] [91] . This is consistent with the fact that bats serve as a reservoir for many coronaviruses and that bats have been observed to have some of the largest and most diverse arrays of APOBEC genes in mammals [67, 69] .
