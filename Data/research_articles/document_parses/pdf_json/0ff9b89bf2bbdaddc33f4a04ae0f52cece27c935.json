This suggests that the function domain might be located in the C-terminal of the N protein, so we examined two other mutants, N226-300 containing the middle part of the N protein and N355-422 containing the C-terminal of the N protein. We found it very strange that these two mutants both had an increase in NF-\u03baB activity [ Fig. 4(B) ]. It seems that all the N protein mutants can activate NF-\u03baB, but the increase in activity in every mutant is lower than that of the full-length N protein. It has been reported that the N protein can be cleaved into several small fragments in virus-infected cells by caspases [11] .

This suggests that the activation of NF-\u03baB by the N protein is cell-specific. The Vero E6 cell line is highly susceptible to virus infection.

This suggests that there is more than one function domain in the N protein responsible for NF-\u03baB activation and that the activation caused by the N protein is a result of the synergistic effect of all the function domains. Furthermore, the localization of these mutants is different. The full-length N protein and N355-422 are located mainly in the cytoplasmid, while N1-225, N226-300 and N226-422 are located in both the cytoplasmid and nucleolus, and the latter two can also be found in the nucleoli (data not shown). The mechanism by which NF-\u03baB is activated by these mutants is unclear. Some mutants may bind directly with the \u03baB binding site in the promoter of the target gene or form a complex with other nuclear factors and then bind with the \u03baB binding site. Other mutants may activate NF-\u03baB through signal pathways. Three nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs in the N protein were identified using PSORT II [ Fig. 4(A) ]. We found that the NF-\u03baB activation caused by the N protein is slightly related to the NLS motifs. The more NLS motifs the mutant has, the higher the NF-\u03baB activity that can be detected. The full-length N protein has three NLS motifs and has the highest NF-\u03baB activity, while N1-225 and N355-422 have only one NLS motif and have the lowest NF-\u03baB activity. NLS is a basic amino acid-rich sequence and can be recognized by proteins of the importin superfamily that mediate transport across the nuclear envelope [12] .

Some of them modulate the NF-\u03baB activity through the binding of the viral particles to the NF-\u03baB receptor, while others modulate the activity through viral proteins.
