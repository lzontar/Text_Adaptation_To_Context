Till date, there is no licensed vaccine of EBOV is available in the market; however, the world is increasingly vulnerable to this emerging threat. Hence, it is the need of time to develop a vaccine for EBOV to hinder its dissemination. The current study has been designed for identification and characterization of the potential B and T-cell epitopes using the Immuno-informatics tools, and it helped in finding the potent vaccine candidates against EBOV. Prediction, antigenicity and allergenicity testing of predicted B and T cells' epitopes was done as well to identify their potential as a vaccine candidate and to measure their safety level respectively. Among B-cell epitopes \"WIPAGIGVTGVIIA\" showed a high antigenicity score and it would play an important role in evoking the immune response. In T-cell epitopes, peptides \"AIGLAWIPY\" and \"IRGFPRCRY\" presented high antigenicity score, which binds to MHC class-I and MHC class-II alleles respectively.

Symptoms of HF include coagulation abnormalities like intravascular coagulation and signs of shock and multiple organ failure, which eventually lead to death [2] . HF due to EBOV was first time reported in 1976, during its outburst in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Zaire). The virus spreads among people due to direct contact with virus-containing fluids like stool, vomitus, breast milk, urine, sweat, saliva, tears, and respiratory secretions. The genome of EBOV, 19.1 kb long, contains seven genes code for different proteins. Transcriptional editing of the fourth gene results in the expression of two proteins, one is GP, 676 amino acid containing trans-membrane protein, and the other is 364-residue containing small glycoprotein (sGP) [3, 4] . GP after translation is cleaved by Furin, a paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme, into GP1 and GP2 subunits linked through a disulfide bond [5, 6] . GP1 and GP2 in a respective manner are involved in attachment and fusion of the virus with the host cell [7] [8] [9] . Several studies showed GP dependent immune system response in non-human primates, i.e. a vaccine based on replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) containing the GP of Ebola virus instead of its own has been tested in phase III of ring vaccination which showed promising results in barring the transmission of EBOV among the vaccinated adults. As reported previously, vector-based vaccines, VSV and adenovirus, containing the GP of EBOV are also involved in evoking CD4 and CD8 T-cell specific immune response. One study reported that GPdirected antibody level was significantly high in animals containing viruslike particles (VLPs) lacking nucleoprotein (NP) rather than animals immunized with NP-containing VLPs or adenovirus-expressed GP [10] . In another study Wilson et al. reported that the GP-specific monoclonal antibodies protected the mice from lethal attack and infection of EBOV [11] . GP-specific murine monoclonal antibodies have been produced and tested in mice model which showed a positive response and prevented the mice from mortality [12] . Similar to these, several studies have been done to produce the GP specific monoclonal antibodies and to use them for protective and diagnostic measures [13, 14] . Hence, owing to all reported studies, EBOV's GP is considered as a significant target to design a vaccine against Ebola virus to hinder its proliferation [15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 224, "end": 227, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 388, "end": 391, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 980, "end": 983, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 984, "end": 986, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1135, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1136, "end": 1138, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1249, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1253, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1257, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2015, "end": 2019, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2039, "end": 2052, "text": "Wilson et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2165, "end": 2169, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2328, "end": 2332, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2492, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2493, "end": 2496, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2653, "end": 2657, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In conventional vaccines commonly attenuated or inactivated whole pathogens are used to induce the immunogenic response.

The rate is much higher in developing countries as compared to the developed ones. So there is an urgent need to combat this devastating threat. Medical biotechnology is playing an impressive role through the preparation of powerful vaccines to hamper the disaster caused by viruses. Identification of epitopes on the basis of experimental approach is time consuming and expensive. Rapid development in immuno-informatics approaches are playing a critical role in decreasing the cost and time, while, increasing the specificity of the epitope-based vaccine designing. It helps in the identification of antigenic parts of the surface exposed protein that could be used to evoke the strong immune response. Therefore, the current study incorporates various immuno-informatics tools and algorithms for the prediction of B cell and T cell epitopes. In recent decades, the vaccine developers have been focusing and relying on GPs, as they are involved in entry and attachment of pathogen with host cell; therefore it plays the role of the disease-causing agent. EBOV's GP, a surface exposed and highly immunogenic protein as having been described by previous studies plays an impressive role in attachment and entry of viral particle into host [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . Due to the surface exposition and reported antigenicity, GP has been chosen as the target protein to develop the epitope-based vaccine in the current study. Numerous GP peptides have been reported and preliminarily checked in primates, and they provided positive feedback; though, there is no approved or licensed vaccine available till the date [11, 12, 29, 30] . Reportedly, three peptides: LYDRLASTV (with antigenicity score 0.4157), VSTGTGPGA-GDFAFHK (0.7059) and EYLFEVDNL (0.3974), of GP have been used to immunize the mice. Two of them were involved in evoking the immune response, while, the peptide \"LYDRLASTV\" was failed to activate the T cells [52] . In another study, three peptides of GP have been used to test their immunogenicity in mice, and all of those were successful in evoking the immune response and described as immunogenic. Further, two peptides, LYDRLASTV and GPCAGDFAF, of the EBOV GP were screened via immuno-informatics tools and later on used to immunize the mice. Both of these showed a positive response and were involved in the stimulation of the T cells [45] . Despite all these reported studies, there is no licensed vaccine of Ebola virus is present in the market till the day. Therefore, the present study was designed to find out the potential B and T cell epitopes, which could be used as vaccine candidates to resist the spread of EBOV. For prediction of B and T cell epitopes, several analyses were carried out at the primary, secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein. Most of the B cell epitopes are discontinuous and nearly 10% epitopes are linear [53] . Different B cell epitopes were predicted with the help of BCPRED and other B-Cell epitope finding tools of IEDB. All the predicted B-cell epitopes are 14 residues long and are highly conserved among all the five species: ZEBOV, TAFV, SUDV, BDBV and RESTV, of EBOV except the 'LHYW-TTQDEGAAIG' which is missing only in the SUDV. Among these, the peptide 'WIPAGIGVTGVIIA' showed the highest immunogenicity score (1.3276) and would act as a robust B-cell epitope and vaccine candidate. Additionally, the position of all predicted B-cell epitopes was confirmed with the help of Episearch. Discontinuous epitopes were also predicted because > 90% of B cell epitopes are distantly separated segments in the pathogen protein sequence and functionally folded 3D structure brings the separated segments into close proximity [54] . Disco Tope 2.0 server was also used to predict the discontinuous epitopes, which are more specific as compared to the linear epitopes as has been reported earlier [26] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1350, "end": 1354, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1359, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1364, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1369, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1370, "end": 1374, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1379, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1732, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1736, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1740, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1744, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2037, "end": 2041, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2469, "end": 2473, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2983, "end": 2987, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3805, "end": 3809, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 3975, "end": 3979, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Currently mostly vaccines are designed on the basis of B cell immunity.

So far, the modern strategy of T-cell epitopes based vaccinology yielded successful results against diseases like malaria and cancer and has exhibited the potent immunogenicity regarding activation of T-cell responses [56] . In this study, several T-cell epitopes have been predicted, which have the binding ability with MHC class-I and class-II alleles. Varying in length, the T-cell epitopes (MHC class-I) are highly conserved among the five species of EBOV except for the peptides 'YWT-TQDEGAAIGL' and 'TTGKLIWKV' which are not applicable to SUDV, and SUDV and RESTV respectively. Among the MHC class-II epitopes, all the peptides are mostly conserved in the all five species of EBOV except for: \"IRGFPRCRY\", \"VVAFLILPQ\" and 'DKLVCRDKLSS' which are not only conserved in TAFV and SUDV respectively. If compared, the peptides already reported (Table 9) are not conserved among all EBOV species, and their antigenicity score is low in contrast to the reported in the current study. The digestion analysis and allergenicity testing vividly presented that the peptides predicted in the current study are stable and safe to use. Moreover, we did the interaction analysis of predicted MHC class-I binding peptides with HLA-B7 allele to check the binding and immune response evoking capability of the predicted peptides. Flexible docking results, score, interacting residues and root mean square deviation, showed that all the predicted peptides have a strong interaction with MHC class-I alleles and can play a positive role in the initiation of immune response and prevention of risks caused by EBOV.
