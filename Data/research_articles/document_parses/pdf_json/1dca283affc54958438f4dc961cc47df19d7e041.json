Abnormality in liver function tests has been reported; almost one-half of patients experience different degrees of liver test abnormalitities. 7, 8 According to a recent study using single-cell RNA sequencing , angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE)2 was highly expressed not only in type II alveolar epithelial cells, but also in bile duct cells. 9 Importantly, recent studies confirmed that ACE2 receptor is the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2.. . 10 All these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the bile duct cells and cause the abnormal liver function in these patients. However, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the bile duct injury marker, is not specific to COVID-19. 7, 8 A recent study reported that moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity were present in liver biopsy specimens, indicating that the liver injury could be caused by either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 11 Currently, however, there are no data to determine whether abnormal liver function in COVID-19 patients is due to drug use or not.
