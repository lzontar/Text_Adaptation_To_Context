These groups experience socio-environmental stressors that can harm mental health. Informed by a social contextual framework, this study explored the prevalence of depression among urban refugee and displaced youth in Kampala, Uganda and associations with symbolic (violence), relational (social support), and material (food and community insecurity) contexts. Methods: We implemented a cross-sectional survey with refugee and displaced adolescent girls and young women and adolescent boys and young men aged 16-24 living in Kampala's informal settlements. We conducted peer-driven recruitment, whereby peer navigators shared study information with their networks and in turn participants were invited to recruit their peers. We conducted gender disaggregated analyses, including stepwise multiple regression to examine factors associated with depression. We then conducted structural equation modeling (SEM) using weighted least squares estimation to examine direct paths from violence, food insecurity, and community insecurity to depression, and indirect effects through social support. Results: Among participants (n = 445), young women (n = 333) reported significantly higher depression symptoms than young men (n = 112), including any symptoms (73.9% vs. 49.1%, p < 0.0001), mild to moderate symptoms (60.4% vs. 45.5%, p = 0.008), and severe symptoms (13.5% vs 3.6%, p = 0.002).

Globally there is a phenomenon of refugee and displaced urbanization-60% of the world's refugees and 80% of internally displaced persons live in urban settings [9] . In Uganda, the urban city of Kampala hosts 78,501 refugee and displaced persons; this includes both refugees (n = 59,923) and people seeking asylum (n = 18,578) [7] . More than one-quarter (28%) of Kampala's urban refugee and displaced persons are youth aged 15-24 [7] . Most refugee and displaced persons in Kampala live in informal settlements, also known as 'slums' [10] .

Over half (56%) of Sub-Saharan Africa's urban population lives in slums [14] that are often characterized by overcrowding and limited sanitation, constrained healthcare access, higher rates of violence, and limited formal employment opportunities that result in precarious employment such as hawking, washing clothes, and survival sex [11] . Neighbourhood effects in slums refer to the ways that community-level health is affected by closely shared social and physical environments, independently from individual household factors. Due to high population density, neighbourhood effects can result in the spreading of illness and poor physical health outcomes (e.g., malnutrition, diarrhea) [15] . Overcrowding in slums can also lead to stress, which in turn can contribute to mental health challenges [11] . There are calls for research specifically focused on slums as \"spatial entities\" with unique needs and lived realities in comparison with non-slum urban areas [15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 156, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 288, "end": 292, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 311, "end": 315, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 372, "end": 376, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 451, "end": 455, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 714, "end": 718, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1073, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1184, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1346, "end": 1350, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(Continued from previous page)"}, {"text": "Mental health in slums is understudied at large [11, 16] , and this is also true in Uganda among both refugee/ displaced and non-refugee/displaced persons. Studies of health issues, including mental health, among refugees and displaced persons in Uganda have focused mainly on persons living in refugee settlements [17] . For instance, in a study with refugee adolescents in Northern Ugandan settlements, one-quarter reported high rates of emotional symptoms and stress and one-fifth anxietyexposure to violence was associated with both stress and anxiety [18] . Qualitative research with urban refugees in another context, Nairobi, reported that community insecurity and violence were collective challenges that harmed mental health [19] . Although safety concerns are reported in some slums, there is heterogeneity within the social and physical environments of slums that underscores the importance of considering context [15] . Safety concerns in non-slum, non-refugee/displaced settings have been associated with depressive symptoms [20] , and this may, in part, be due to social isolation and mistrust. Another issue facing people living in slums in diverse locations such as India [21] , Kenya [22] , and Uganda [23, 24] is food insecurity. In turn, food insecurity is associated with elevated vulnerability to mental health challenges [25] . A study with adolescent girls living in slums in India reported associations between food insecurity and depression [26] . There is an urgent need to understand intervenable contextual factors that shape mental health with urban refugee and displaced youth living in slums to inform tailored programming. This study is informed by a social contextual approach conceptualized by Campbell and Cornish [27] . In 'receptive social environments' persons have increased agency over their health and wellbeing [27, 28] . Such supportive and health-enabling social contexts include equitable social relationships. Three elements of social context emerge as important in understanding health promotion [27, 29] . Material contexts include access to resources, such as money, food, housing, and other economic opportunities. Relational contexts include social capital and social relationships, including with friends, families, and external actors. Finally, the symbolic context refers to larger cultural worldviews and ideologies, including gender equity and recognition of one's worth, value, dignity, and rights. This approach may be particularly important for conceptualizing mental health among refugee and displaced youth. For instance, symbolic contexts that reduce the rights and dignity of refugee and displaced youth and contribute to depression include experiences of violence [18, 19] . Food insecurity [25] and community insecurity [19, 20] reflect material contexts associated with depression. Finally, relational contexts such as social support may be a protective factor for depression [30] [31] [32] , including in stressful neighbourhoods [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 48, "end": 52, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 53, "end": 56, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 315, "end": 319, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 556, "end": 560, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 734, "end": 738, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 925, "end": 929, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1042, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1192, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1201, "end": 1205, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1223, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1224, "end": 1227, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1347, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1470, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1749, "end": 1753, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1857, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1861, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2047, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2051, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2728, "end": 2732, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2733, "end": 2736, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2755, "end": 2759, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2785, "end": 2789, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2790, "end": 2793, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2942, "end": 2946, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2947, "end": 2951, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2952, "end": 2956, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2997, "end": 3001, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(Continued from previous page)"}, {"text": "To our knowledge, pathways between symbolic, material, and relational contextual factors and depression are understudied among urban refugee and displaced youth in Uganda.

Notably our study applied gender-stratified analyses [40] that revealed important differences in prevalence and correlates of depression symptoms with urban refugee and displaced youth.

The finding that threequarters of AGYW in our study reported depression symptoms is alarming and calls for urgent attention. While this proportion is higher than the 29% reported among adult women in Northern Uganda [44, 45] , it is also difficult to make direct comparisons as we included Table 4 Final path model parameter estimates of the relationship between a latent construct of violence, community insecurity, depression, and the proposed mediator of friends' social support among urban refugee and displaced adolescent girls and young women in Kampala, Uganda (N = 333) persons with major depression disorders scored as mild, moderately severe and severe, while it is not clear of the severity levels of major depression in the Northern Ugandan study. The reasons behind women's global experiences of a higher prevalence of depression than men are contested, some situate these differences within social contexts, psychological factors, sociocultural roles and expectations, and inequitable power dynamics and labour distribution [1, 46] . Our findings reveal contextual factors uniquely associated with depression among AGYW and ABYM. For instance, our finding that violence was associated with depression among AGYW aligns with the rich evidence base about the sequalae of experiencing SGBV in adolescence and young adulthood, including risk of longterm health challenges such as depression [44] . This finding also expands knowledge of violence and associated mental health challenges in rural refugee settlements [18] to consider analogous experiences of SGBV in slums/informal settlements [15] . This finding corroborates qualitative research by Im et al. [19] with urban refugees in Nairobi that discuss SGBV, lack of support, and community level insecurities that harm mental wellbeing.

This corroborates global research that has consistently documented complex linkages between food insecurity and depression [45, 47] . Research has identified bidirectional relationships between depression and food insecurity, whereby food insecurity is a toxic, extreme and chronic stressor that contributes to anxiety, depression and suicidality [45, 47] . Food insecurity can also contribute to shame, powerlessness, and can exacerbate tensions and disparities within families [45] . Depression and mental health challenges can also reduce capabilities to obtain and maintain regular employment, in turn elevating risks of food insecurity. Most food insecurity studies have focused on women [45, 47] , yet a global review did not find sex differences in the associations between food insecurity and mental health. Future research can explore the gendered dynamics [40] between food insecurity, reduced social support, and depression among urban refugee and displaced youth, and why food insecurity has particularly detrimental impacts on ABYM's mental wellbeing. Overall findings signal an urgent need to address food insecurity among urban refugee and displaced youth-75% of ABYM and 71% of AGYW reported food insecurity. Finally, social support holds promise as an intervenable factor that could mitigate the effects of harmful contextual factors on wellbeing. Lifetime violence experiences among AGYW were associated with lower social support from friends. It is plausible that SGBV stigma and gender inequitable social norms may increase shame and social isolation among AGYW [46] , creating barriers to accessing social support from peers. Food insecurity can also lead to blame, guilt and shame, in turn contributing to social isolation [47] . This may explain the finding that food insecurity was associated with lower social support among ABYM.

We only assessed depression, and a fuller picture of mental health could be acquired if we had also measured anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Our brief food insecurity measure, while used in prior studies [37, 38] , does not provide information about the scope, persistence, and nature of food insecurity. Similarly, our single-item measure of perceived community insecurity could be expanded in future research to better understand community safety concerns. The violence measures were also single-item, and may have overlooked variations in the types, extent, levels and perpetrators of violence. We pilot tested the survey and made the decision with community partners to shorten the survey to increase feasibility and reduce participant burden.
