One such manifestation is delirium, an acute confusional state occurring in 60-70% of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases. Delirium is also a common clinical syndrome following planned orthopedic surgery. This investigation initially explored the underlying role of metabolism in delirium-susceptibility in this setting. Metabolomics profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood taken prior to surgery found significant concentration differences of several amino acids, acylcarnitines and polyamines were observed in delirium-prone patients. Phenethylamine (PEA) concentrations in delirium-prone patients was significantly lower in CSF than in blood, whilst in age-and gender-matched controls the opposite was observed (adjusted p values: 1.8x10 -6 (control) and 1.788x10 -10 (delirium)). PEA is metabolised by monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), a putative enzyme target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and depression. Our computational structural comparisons of MAOB and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 found high similarity, specifically within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. MAOB structural alignment to ACE2 was 51% overall, but this was over 95% in the ACE2-spike protein binding region. Thus, it is possible that the spike protein interacts with MAOB on a molecular level. A previously published metabolomic dataset of control subjects and patients with either mild or severe COVID-19 was then analysed. Major concentration differences in some metabolites attributed to altered MAO activity were detected. Therefore, our hypothesis is that the SARS-CoV-2 influences MAOB activity, which is one potential cause for the many observed neurological and platelet based complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Analysis of metabolomics differences in delirium-prone patients and in severe cases of SARS-CoV2 infection indicate possibly significant role for monoamine oxidase B (MAOB). Changes in activity of MAOB have been shown in other conditions to cause range of symptoms observed in SARS-CoV2 infection. Computational structural analysis presented here demonstrations significant similarity between MAOB and ACE2 protein binding region leading to a hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein affects MAOB activity during the infection. This proposition is of possibly highly significance for both diagnosis of high-risk subjects prior to infection as well as novel avenues for the development of treatment and prevention.",

Some early studies of hospitalized patients indicated that 20-30% of COVID-19 patients develop some form of delirium or mental status change rising to 60-70% for those patients with severe illness of all age groups (2, 3) . The exact mechanisms are not understood although a number of possible causes have been proposed including direct viral invasion, cerebrovascular involvement, hypoxia, pyrexia, dehydration, hyperinflammation (cytokine storm), medications or metabolic derangements (2, 3) .

Metabolomics analysis of body fluids provides a wideranging molecular window into the major metabolic processes of the body. For the investigation of delirium a detailed examination of CSF provides an insight into altered brain metabolism. CSF metabolite biomarkers of delirium risk have already been identified (10) . Major differences in the concentrations of polyamines (including spermidine and putrescine) are present in delirium-prone patients even before surgery or the presentation of delirium. However, it is not clear whether such metabolic changes occur more peripherally in the blood circulation, or whether the transfer of these metabolite across the blood-brain barrier is important. This investigation conducted an identical metabolomics methodology on the corresponding paired pre-operative blood samples comparing the individual blood and CSF profiles of each patient.",

(10) presented metabolomics and proteomics analysis of serum of mild and severe COVID-19 patients indicating major concentration differences in serotonin, kynurenine, a number of amino acids, as well as, alterations in tryptophan and polyamine metabolic pathways. This metabolomics and proteomics analysis also indicated major role for platelets in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The metabolomics data were in agreement with clinical studies showing coagulopathy as one of the major issues in severe COVID-19 cases (12) as well as delirium, possibly associated with changes in neurotransmitters, such as serotonin (13) . In the present investigation we interrogate different clinical metabolomics datasets (including one produced by our group) in order to uncover a biochemical relationship between delirium and COVID-19. The involvement of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) emerges as a common potential candidate. MAO is worthy of further exploration given that it is important for neurotransmitter metabolism, has prior associations with delirium, and is involved in platelet regulation and coagulation (14) (15) (16) as well as anosmia (17) . MAO including MAOA and MAOB are flavoenzymes that catalyze the oxidative transformation of monoamines. The inhibition of these enzymes is a target for therapeutic development with the selectivity of candidate molecules for one isoform over another being a key consideration (20, 21) . Alterations in the activities of MAOs is a potential source of various neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, autism or aggressive behavior (22, 23) . Additionally function of MAOs represents an inherent source of oxidative stress, leading to the damage and death of neurons, ultimately leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease (24, 25) .",

For the CSF data the output was closely aligned with the previously published analysis (10) . The importance of specific metabolites to the model's discriminatory power are shown in coefficient plots (Supplementary Figure 2) . The most important contributors in control and delirium sample separation in CSF were spermidine, putrescine, glutamine (as previously reported by Pan et al (10) ), but also 3-hydroxypalmitoleylcarnitine (C16-1-OH), linoleic acid (C18-2), carnitine (C0) and, to a lesser extent, a number of other metabolites (Supplementary Figure 2 shown in red). For blood metabolomic data the discrimination of control and delirium patients was influenced most by levels of proline, ornithine, lysine, trans-4-hydroxyproline (t4-OH-Pro), PC aa C24:0 and PC aa C26:0 as well as H1, ADMA, C7-DC and, to a lesser extent, a number of other metabolites (shown in red in Supplementary Figure 2) .",

            "text": "The above results were further corroborated by application of Statistical Analysis for Microarrays (SAM) (18) , which has been previously applied to metabolomics data (19) (Figure 1A ). SAM analysis of normalized CSF data found significant differences in CSF for ornithine, glutamine, putrescine, spermidine and threonine, similarly as previously shown (10) and in good agreement with the above PLS-DA (ornithine, glutamine, putrescine and spermidine were major features). Threonine was not one of the most significant contributors to the classification coefficients, but was still a significant contributor to the PLS-DA sample grouping. SAM analysis of blood metabolites shows major differences in pre-operative blood samples in proline, threonine, lysine, ornithine and phosphatidylcholines (specifically PC aa C26:0). ** Figure 1 . ABOUT HERE ** . The availability of metabolic profiles for CSF and blood provides a unique possibility for the determination of significant differences in metabolite concentrations between these two body fluids giving information about the transfer and metabolism across the blood brain barrier as well as the possibility for the determination of blood-based biomarkers that are representative of changes in the CSF ( Figure 1B ). As can be expected there are major metabolic differences between CSF and blood in both control and delirium-prone group with majority of metabolites showing highly comparable behaviour in the two groups. Notable exceptions are metabolites that show opposite concentration in the two body fluids namelyphenethylamine (PEA) with higher concentration in CSF relative to blood in control subjects and opposite in delirium and Octadecadienylcarnitine (C 18:2) and hexanoylcarnitine (C6 (C4:1-DC)) showing higher concentration in blood then in CSF in control group. PEA is a natural monoamine alkaloid that acts as a central nervous system stimulant. Octadecadienylcarnitine (also called Linoleyl carnitine) and hexanoylcarnitine is a long-chain acyl fatty acid derivatives of carnitine. Difference in concentration in these three metabolites are significant in both control and delirium groups with adjusted p-values for blood to CSF groups in control: for PEA adj. p= 1.83e-6; C 18:2 adj. p= 6.1e-4 and C6 (C4:1-DC) adj. p= 6.6e-4 and delirium: PEA adj. p= 1.8e-10; C 18:2 adj. p= 2.8e-10 and C6 (C4:1-DC) adj. p= 5.9e-8. Although the difference in these three metabolites between CSF and blood is significant the difference of their concentrations between control and delirium observed separately in CSF and blood is only minor. In CSF PEA is overall slightly reduced in the delirium group (adj. p-value = 0.1) while C 18:2 and C6 (C4:1-DC) are unchanged. Similarly in plasma PEA concentration is slightly lower in delirium and C 18:2 and C6 (C4:1-DC) are unchanged. Therefore, overall PEA is slightly reduced in delirium-prone patients, prior to operation and significantly, in this group PEA concentration is significantly lower in CSF then in blood. PEA is a neurotransmitter integral to the signalling process in the central nervous system. It can be oxidised through the function of monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes. ** Figure 2 . ABOUT HERE ** Observed changes in PEA levels suggest changes in activity of MAO in delirium-prone patient cohort. MAOB is the only MAO protein found in platelets (for MAOA and MAOB protein expression please see Supplementary Figure 3 ) and has been linked to the activity of platelets and dysfunction .

Patient information provided with the original publication does not include any data on possible delirium in these patients and we assumed, based on recent clinical studies (47) that patients with severe disease were more likely to have delirium than mild cases (with 60-70% in severe cases and 20-30% of hospitalized patients). For comparison we are providing major features selected using statistical, SAM methods ( Figure 3A ) as well as machine learning -Random Forest methodology and SHAP analysis of feature (metabolite) contribution to the ML model ( Figure 3B ). ** Figure 3 ABOUT HERE ** The number of metabolites showing major concentration difference between severe and mild cases can be related to pathways involving MAO enzyme (see Supplementary Figure 4 for all known direct interactions of MAOA and/or MAOB and metabolites). Specifically ratios of ceramide to sphingosine 1-phosphate (known as \"sphingolipid rheostat\") is known to affect activity of MAO (26) . The ratio between these metabolites based on the COVID-19 patient data provided by (11) is shown in Figure 4A and shows an increase with disease severity suggesting increasing activity of MAO. However, analysis of specific reaction partners that are related to MAO function shows a slight decrease of MAOB activity in severe cases ( Figure 4B ) while MAOA activity (indicated with Figure 4C reaction) is increasing in severe patient response. ** Figure 4 . ABOUT HERE ** In order to investigate the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 virus directly influences MAOB function the structures of MAOB and ACE2 (as a known binding target of SARS-CoV-2) were compared (4) . Overall structural comparison between MAOB (PDB structure 1GOS) and ACE2 (PDB structure 6M0J), showed only 51% overall structural similarity. However the comparison of the ACE2spike protein binding region with MAOB resulted in 90% to 100% structure overlap. Further computational analysis of the spike-protein relation to MAOB protein is shown in Figure 5 . ** Figure 5 . ABOUT HERE ** Specifically, analysis of the overall structure similarity between ACE2 and MAOB using jFATCAT_flexible (27) resulted in ACE2 similarity of 42% and MAOB similarity of 51% with the Pvalue:6.67e-01. However, further analysis of subsection of ACE2 involved in binding to Spike protein indicated as 1 and 2 ( Figure 5A ) shows major similarity (Section 1 6M0J Similarity:100% 1GOS Similarity:100% P-value:1.67e-02 Section 2 6M0J Similarity:74%; 1GOS Similarity:100% Pvalue:5.01e-01) suggesting possibility for interaction between MAOB and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ( Figure 5A shows the association between MAOB and ACE2 overlapping regions and spike protein) leading to possibility for MAOB activity change in severe COVID-19 patients ( Figure 5B shows computational representation of the binding location of spike protein to MAOB indicating also the MAOB ligand).",

This investigation generated and interrogated metabolomics data in order to identify the underlying metabolic perturbations associated with postoperative delirium. A range of metabolite associations emerged (Figure 1 ), but PEA was one of the most profoundly affected metabolites in patients who later experienced postoperative delirium. In delirium-prone individuals PEA concentrations are slightly reduced both in the CSF and blood plasma relative to the control group. Interestingly, for PEA an inverse relationship exists in these two compartments for these two groups with the significantly smaller PEA concentration in CSF relative to blood in delirium-prone cohort. Brain monoamines include common biogenic amines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) and trace amines such as PEA (29) . PEA has been shown to alter the serotonin transporter by interacting with trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) (29) . Activation of TAAR1 with PEA significantly inhibits uptake and induces efflux of dopamine and norepinephrine. Observed alterations in PEA are highly plausible because monoamine oxidase (MAO), one of the key enzymes responsible for its metabolism, is a known target for treatment of a variety of neurological conditions including depression, Parkinson's disease and recently Alzheimer's disease (16) . MAO is an enzyme localised on the outer mitochondrial membrane and it preferentially degrades benzylamine and PEA. The MAO family of proteins oxidizes a number of different amine substrates including small-molecule monoamines, polyamines as well as modified amino acids in proteins, and directly influences number of different metabolites (Supplementary Figure 4) .",

MAOB is particularly important for the metabolism of neuroactive and vasoactive amines in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Expression of MAOB increases with age and is associated with increases in free radical damage and ROS formation. This in turn leads to a decrease in neuronal mitochondrial function and ultimately neurodegeneration (30) which is partly due to reduced PEA concentrations. MAO inhibitors have been extensively developed and utilized for treatment of depression (9, https://www.nice.org.uk/). A number of publications have also investigated the therapeutic effects of MAO inhibitors for other neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression (16) . Specifically, MAOB has been proposed as a possible therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease due to its association with aberrant GABA production, but it also has therapeutic relevance for Parkinson's disease due to its role in dopamine depletion (16, 31) .",

MAOB is highly expressed in neurones, as well as platelets (35) Previously reported links between HIV infection and changes in monoamine and acylcarnitine metabolites (as well as inflammatory markers) indicates that viral infection and inflammation can alter monoamine metabolism and mitochondrial energetics (36) . At the same time a number of side-effects previously listed for MAO inhibitors have also been observed in COVID-19 patients. One of the, as yet unresolved, effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a subgroup of patients is the development of a systemic coagulopathy and acquired thrombophilia characterized by a proclivity for venous, arterial and microvascular thrombosis (12) . Additionally, severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (where delirium is apparent) also experience low blood oxygen levels, elevated urea, acute renal dysfunction (37)all of which are symptomatic of MAOB inhibition overdose or drug side-effects such as anosmia, a known symptom of dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease.

Additionally, tryptophan plasma concentration in both mild and severe patients is significantly reduced relative to the healthy subjects (Supplementary Figure 5 ) corroborated with the reduction in the concentration of arachidonate and related metabolites in severe relative to mild and both groups of infected patients relative to healthy subjects. Arachidonic acid is metabolized by activated platelets possibly leading to their aggregation. High risk groups for severe response to SARS-CoV-2 infection have known increased activity of MAO enzymes including: age, obesity, diabetes, heart condition (www.who.int). In addition to other symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 causes hematological changes which include reduced platelet count (38) . With known role of MAO in number of observed SARS-CoV-2 symptoms we have performed computational analysis of possible effect of SARS-Co2 virus spike protein on MAO. A preliminary computational structure comparison of MAOB and ACE2 protein has been performed here in order to determine whether there is a possibility for binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to MAOB ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 6-9) . Although the sequence similarity between ACE2 and MAOB proteins is limited there is an almost coincident alignment and structure similarity in the region involved in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding. Binding of the spike protein to MAOB could result in a change in either its enzymatic function, its post-translational modification or association with is protein partners including cell surface amino oxidases such as vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1) (also known as AOC3) a known non-classical inflammation-inducible endothelial molecule (39) . The over-activity of MAOB can result in the observed PEA concentration decrease and the major changes observed in the polyamines as well as related amino acids in the delirium-prone patients. Pro-inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines lead to MAO-dependent increases in reactive oxygen species causing mitochondrial dysfunction (14) . At the same time, interference with MAOB activity in subjects with overactive MAOB can lead to the side-effects observed in MAOB inhibition as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection. Metabolomics analysis and symptom similarity of pre-operative delirium prone patients as well as COVID-19 patients indicates the potential dysfunction of MAOB. Computational modeling defines a mechanism by which the spike protein directly binds to MAOB thereby interfering with its normal function and particularly affecting patients with increased MAOB expressions. Further analysis is currently under way to explore in greater detail the role of MAOB in delirium and SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Quantitative metabolomic profiling was performed using the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 (BIOCRATES, Life Science AG, Innsbruck, Austria) using a Xevo TQ-MS triplequadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) as previously described (41) . Briefly, this comprised of two general methods: UPLC (I-Class, Waters Corporation, UK) reversedphase (Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 2.1 \u00d7 50 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm; UK) with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), and flow injection analysis (FIA) also operating in MRM mode. Metabolite concentrations were calculated and expressed as micromolar (\u00b5M).",
