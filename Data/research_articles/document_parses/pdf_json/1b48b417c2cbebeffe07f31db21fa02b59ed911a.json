The third explanation (inequalities in care) may be less important in our case. The German health care systems offers universal access to both ambulatory and hospital care.

Similarly, people with lower income are more likely to the live in adverse environments (including crowded housing conditions or possible exposure in public transport). A second explanation refers to inequalities in vulnerability.
