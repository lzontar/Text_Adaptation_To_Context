This is functionally analogous and equivalent in results to the type of human coding of text data performed by anthropologists and ethnographers; but unlike more conventional topic modelling, STM makes it possible to link topic models to metadata and quantitative data in a way that is directly amenable to statistical modelling [16, 17] .

The topics were then labelled manually (this and defining the number of topics of interest were the only subjective components of the process) by first examining the word usage within topics (weighted by exclusivity) and then assessing a number of representative perspectives (quotes) from each of the topics.
