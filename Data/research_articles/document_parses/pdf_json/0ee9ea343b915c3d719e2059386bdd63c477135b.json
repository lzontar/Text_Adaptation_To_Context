A randomized blocks field experiment (1986)(1987)(1988)(1989) was used to study the effects of five levels of nitrogen input treatments: 0 = control, 25, 50, 100 and 200 kg of N fertilizer per ha per yr. In Phase II of the experiment (1990)(1991)(1992)(1993), each plot was split into two subplots. The allocated fertilizer treatment for the plot was continued in one, randomly selected, subplot but the treatment was discontinued in the other subplot. The experiment not only identified and quantified the changes occurring in the vegetation of hay meadows under different levels of N input, it also provided valuable insight into the dynamics of the sward upon the discontinuance of the treatments. The data for Phase II were used to estimate the time required by the changed vegetation (under different nitrogen treatments) to revert to a state comparable to that prevailing in the control plots. A method for estimating reversion times is described. The main difficulties in estimating the reversion times are identified, the choice of robust vegetation variables being critical. Reversion time estimation methods are presented and used to obtain working estimates for the four nitrogen treatments, applied for 5 yr. These estimates are 3, 5, 7 and 9 yr respectively. The validity of the estimates of 3 yr for the lowest nitrogen input treatment (25 kg /ha/yr) was checked using the available post cessation data.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "fertilizer on the botanical composition of British seminatural grasslands were sparse, and almost absent for wet grasslands of the types found on the Somerset Levels and Moors.

This paper is concerned with the reversion of vegetation after fertilizer input had been discontinued, and focuses in particular on the estimation of the vegetation reversion times after the cessation of fertilizer application. To that end, a method is advanced for estimating recovery times for vegetation following some perturbation; in the present case that perturbation stemmed from four years of fertilizer use.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Objectives and hypotheses to be tested"}, {"text": "In a review of a wide range of studies on the relationship between fertilizer addition and species abundance, Marrs (1993) concluded that species diversity was reduced whenever the original ecosystem was relatively species-rich, but that in species-poor communities, the application of fertilizers increased species diversity, a finding which was consistent with the 'hump-back' model developed by Grime (1979) . Using this model, elimination of nitrogen input, resulting in (possibly gradual) reduction of both nutrient availability and hay yield, would be predicted to lead to increased speciesrichness (Oomes 1992) . The results of the latter study indicate that maximum species-richness was achieved at between 4 and 6 tonnes/ha dry matter. In 1990, fertilized grassland at Tadham Moor comprised vegetation which had changed as a result of nitrogen input. The vegetation in N-treated plots was expected to be, and was, different from that in unfertilized (control) plots in at the beginning of Phase II, and varied with the levels of the nitrogen input. In 1990, dry-matter yields were \u2265 7 tonnes/ha wherever nitrogen had been applied, and there was a significant suppression of species richness at high levels of fertilizer (Mountford et al. , 1994 . Once fertilizer treatment ceased at Tadham, it might be postulated that the vegetation would revert, over a period of time, to a composition indistinguishable from that found in adjacent untreated swards, with restored high species diversity, and a dry matter yield comparable with the controls (i.e. ca. 4.5 -5 tonnes/ha). In a closed sward of the type found at Tadham Moor, where regeneration niches are restricted, increased diversity following the cessation of fertilizer use would be more likely to result from changes in the relative extent of long-lived perennials, rather than the recruitment either of new species, or of species lost to that sward during Phase I. Thus whilst the number of species per m 2 might increase, the total number of species within the plot might not recover. However, the cessation of fertilizer input might simply trigger change, rather than determine the precise outcome of such change (Olff & Bakker 1991) . Further, it was anticipated that the vegetation in previously treated plots may show a trend towards a new equilibrium, and could also be subject to trends and fluctuations induced by external environmental factors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 110, "end": 122, "text": "Marrs (1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 398, "end": 410, "text": "Grime (1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 605, "end": 617, "text": "(Oomes 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1253, "text": "(Mountford et al. , 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2199, "text": "(Olff & Bakker 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Objectives and hypotheses to be tested"}, {"text": "The field experiment at Tadham consisted of three randomized blocks, with five plots in each block.

For this paper, the approach for grouping the species was based partly on higher taxonomic units (grasses, forbs, bryophytes, sedges and rushes) and partly on the ecological indicator values for the individual species (Ellenberg 1988 ). In the Ellenberg system, the Nitrogen value (N) of a species is a 9-point scale, reflecting occurrence of the species along a gradient of available nitrogen during the growing period. This ranking is based on considerable experimental and field observation and was believed to be a reliable criterion for grouping species. The N ranking was thought to be appropriate to the present study, since it reflects the understanding of how different species might react to different levels of nitrogen. Species were allocated to seven groups using an N indicator value of 6 as a threshold to separate species thought to respond well to fertilizer application (N \u2265 6) from those more typical of nitrogen deficient soils (N \u2264 5).

Thus, for example, an estimate R = -20 is unsatisfactory because a negative estimate is not meaningful. Similarly, a series of estimates such as R 50 = 5, R 100 = 50 and R 200 = 20 clearly breach the inequality in R k values mentioned above; comparing these series with estimates obtained using other vegetation variables might point to (for example) the estimate R 100 = 50 yr as being unsatisfactory (as a likely large overestimate).

The results of the Tadham Moor study reported here derive from a relatively shortterm experiment, and studies in other grassland types suggest that the effect of past fertilizer application may be discerned many years after cessation e.g. > 30 yr in a Swiss montane Nardetum (Hegg et al. 1992) , or 17 yr after fertilizer had ceased in a Centaureo-Cynosuretum cristati meadow in Lincolnshire (Silvertown et al. 1994 ). Thus, although there was evidence that the Nsubplots were diverging from those where fertilizer application continued, clear effects of past treatment were still observed in 1993, indicating that reversion was certainly not complete where high levels of N had been applied. In Phase II, both M and I increased for the Nsubplots which by 1993 were distinctly more diverse than the N + subplots. The apparent rate of increase in M (ca. 1 species/m 2 /yr in all treatments) was faster than that reported for peat in the Netherlands (1 species / 4 m 2 in four years) (Bakker 1987) . Further evidence of sward reversion in the Nsubplots derives from comparison of results for agricultural productivity with changes in the value of M (Mountford et al. 1994) .

Even more importantly, there is much evidence that fertilizer residues can build up in the soil after continuous application, and that this is particularly the case for phosphorus (Marrs 1993 ). Hence, those species which should begin to increase or decrease as a result of the non-availability of nitrogen may not do so immediately. The considerable 'inertia' in sward composition after fertilizer application has ceased owes much to an enhanced phosphorus status and its is estimated that it would take >13 yr following cessation before the P status declined to the levels current prior to the application of fertilizer (Mountford et al. 1994 ). Thus the assumption of an immediate progress towards reversion, implied in the fitted straight line models (Eqs. 1 -5), may not hold, introducing a bias in the estimates of the R k values. It can be argued that if the estimates of reversion time turns out to be some positive number of years, then the bias due to this complication is likely to be positive, tending to inflate the estimates. However, in many instances, perhaps partly because of the continued availability of nitrogen applied during Phase I (and also because of the changed nature of the vegetation by the end of Phase I) the vegetation in the previously treated Phase II to greater cover than in 1986 prior to the introduction of fertilizer treatments. This rapid recovery in two grasses typical of infertile soils may partly explain why most other species continued to show a negative trend with past nitrogen.

However, if Phase II coincided with an external trend (e.g. steady increase or decrease in temperature, rainfall etc), then this might induce a trend in the values of the vegetation variables. With only a few years' data, such fluctuations can also induce spurious trends in time. The comparison of the trends in NK ij values (Eqs. 2 -5) with the trend in N0 ij values (Eq. 1) tend to cancel out such effects. This is because the procedure used is algebraically identical to first obtaining the differences DK ij defined by (NK ij -N0 ij ) and then estimating the rever-subplots continued to diverge from that in the control subplots. In such cases, the fitted linear trend lines will be extrapolated backwards in time for them to meet, and hence estimates of reversion times will be negative. With only three years' data after the discontinuance of fertilizer treatment, it is also possible for the estimates of the slopes in the fitted models to be sufficiently in error so as to yield negative estimates of reversion times.
