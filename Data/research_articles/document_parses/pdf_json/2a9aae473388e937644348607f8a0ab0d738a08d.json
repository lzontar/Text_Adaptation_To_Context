The latter mentioned infections resulted in the deaths of one third of the population of women infected with these infections. An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the near past has been declared a pandemic and it is predicted to be at its peak in USA, Europe and many other developing countries around the end of April, or in first two weeks of May 2020.

Without appropriate guidelines and practical approaches, communication with obstetricians regarding their practices has rapidly emerged, and clinicians require guidelines in the challenges time [15] . Besides, sometimes care providers are pregnant themselves, and they have added a level of concern regarding their health and their unborn babies.

All those studies which were focused on pregnant women and their challenges, without any discussion on COVID-19, were excluded.

Since we had no facility to translate the articles in German and French languages to the English language and therefore, we excluded them. Research studies published before the dates, as mentioned earlier, were excluded. After examining the titles and abstracts, if abstracts were not available, those articles were not counted [17] .

During pandemics, resources funnel away from the reproductive health system to the urgent focused targets which are pressing the world. However, it is known that pregnant women, in search of safety, rely more on the accessible health system for a successful childbirth [4] . The consequences of delayed access to a health system for them are stillbirths, preterm deliveries, maternal mortality and respiratory complications. Regardless of these consequences, Ashokka et al. [4] state that vertical transmission of COVID-19 from pregnant women with infections to a fetus remained unlikely in several cases in Singapore.",

            "text": "A recent study has shown that the SARS-COV2 virus is not detected in the breast milk, amniotic fluid and cord blood in women who have been infected with SARS-COV2. It was also indicated that all neonates were free from infection. During the \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\" (SARS) epidemic, the virus disease remained lower in neonates as compared to adults. This might be due to the difficulty of the vertical transmission of the virus. The same study has also revealed that COVID-19 not only adversely affects lungs, but it also weakens the functioning of kidneys and testicles. So at this stage of research on COVID-19, it cannot be ruled out that COVID-19 may have an impact on the placenta. Therefore, for the safety of pregnant women and neonates, the elective Cesarean delivery is the best option in this crisis time of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, cesarean delivery time is crucial for both physicians and medical staff, because a COVID-19 infection can quickly deteriorate the functioning of the lungs. So, pregnant women and neonates, along with the physicians and nurses, must meet safety measures in operation theatre rooms. Apart from this, biosafety measures need to be followed by medical staff when they enter or leave the operation theatre rooms [5] . These safety measures are discussed with regards to a study performed with respect to Chinese populations with the help of Wuhan University China. This study is a preliminary effort by researchers regarding the safety of women and neonates, and similar measures must be necessarily taken in other countries, which are at great risk of COVID-19 at this present time.",

They have strongly recommended the cancellation of transfers of frozen or fresh embryos. It has been remarked by them that \"We fear the worst is yet to come\" [6] . This statement is not only mirroring the situation prevailing in Mexico but also in many other countries of the world, where no measures have been taken to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19. No substantive measures are currently underway to break the power of the COVID-19 pandemic. The non-availability of reproductive medicine in Italy is a challenging risk. Therefore, we need to educate ourselves and suggest more measures to ensure the availability of medicine, which is one of the essential requirements of a reproductive system.",

In the above mentioned study, researchers have presented a review of several studies to investigate the causes of women becoming susceptible to the COVID-19 infection. In contrast to the findings of studies reviewed in this paper, the earlier review studies presented that neonates and pregnant women were easily susceptible to COVID-Potential risks of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection to pregnant women and neonates Potential risks of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection have been considered in various studies [4, 8, 10]. However, we need more evidence to develop clinical evidence and preventive strategies. Chen et al. [11] conducted a study on the vertical transmission of the COVID-19 infection from pregnant women to neonates. However, the findings of the study indicated that pregnant women with COVID-19 did not show any different symptoms as compared to nonpregnant women without the COVID-19 infection. Based on the findings of the above-mentioned studies, we are still not convinced, because many complications arising in pregnant women cannot be linked to COVID-19 at the present time. A study suggested that pregnant women require special attention during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, because at these stages, hormones and the immune system show many variations. Foreign fetal antigen poses challenges to the normal functioning of a woman\"s immune system. The immune system of women keeps adjusting the balance till the time period of late pregnancy [12]. However, serious immune system disorders may occur if COVID-19 infects the women at the earlier stages of pregnancy. Previous studies have also shown that SARS 2003 and H1N1 2009 created serious complications in mothers and neonates. Based on the evidence, we should be careful of the COVID-19 infection when it comes to pregnant women, throughout the pregnancy stages.",
