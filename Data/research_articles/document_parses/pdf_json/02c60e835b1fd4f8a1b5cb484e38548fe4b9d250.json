            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) due to a novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is now a global pandemic. There are more than 1.5 million confirmed cases across almost every country in the world, and at the time of writing (early April 2020) there were close to 100 000 recorded deaths. [1] The diagnosis of COVID-19 can be challenging, and as with any disease entity, a number of factors, including disease stage, disease prevalence, patient profile and sample type and quality, can influence diagnostic test performance. In this review we outline the performance outcomes of key tests used to diagnose COVID-19, and considerations that modulate performance. The safety of healthcare workers collecting samples, laboratory safety aspects and experimental approaches such as detection of volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath, mass spectrometry studies of different sample types, methods of signal amplification and utility of other novel approaches are not discussed here.",

These recommendations have been guided by the phase of the epidemic and available resources. Generally speaking, testing for COVID-19 should currently be considered in anyone with symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection (upper or lower) and with or without systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue and myalgia. [2] [3] [4] [5] In mild disease, testing directs the need for self-isolation and identification of new cases through contact tracing and testing of contacts. As the epidemic progresses, and with forecasted limited testing capacity, testing may be directed to specific subgroups or those with enhanced risk of a poor outcome.",

Relevant investigations will depend on the clinical context, and will likely include pulmonary imaging, relevant laboratory investigations, blood cultures and interrogation of urine and/or lower respiratory tract specimens to rule in a viral, mycobacterial, fungal and/or bacterial cause. Clinical and laboratory parameters that may suggest viral infection include pyrexia, acute malaise and myalgia, and lymphopenia. C-reactive protein is unhelpful in distinguishing COVID-19 from other infections. Procalcitonin is elevated in severe COVID-19 and when there is secondary bacterial infection. [6, 7] In early disease low procalcitonin may distinguish COVID-19 from bacterial infections, but not from other viral diseases (data are awaited to confirm this supposition). In those with underlying asthma or COPD the presence of pulmonary infiltrates may favour a respiratory infection-related cause, though a cardiac cause must also be considered in the differential diagnosis.",

There is already considerable shortage of reagents (and swabs), meaning that dry swabs are being sent to laboratories in some centres. Dry swabs are less costly and more conducive to community-based testing, but data are urgently required to determine the comparative sensitivity of dry swabs compared with using viral transport medium (taking into account the time from sample acquisition to sample processing). Samples from the lower respiratory tract including sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchial washings and bronchoalveolar lavage may also be sent. In patients with COVID-19 disease, samples from the lower respiratory tract are more likely to test positive (discussed below). Viral RNA can also be detected in stool in ~30% of cases, and in blood in ~1% of cases, [8] but rarely in urine.",

            "text": "In symptomatic individuals, 80 -90% of patients have mild symptoms not requiring hospitalisation. Depending on age and the presence of risk factors, ~10 -20% of symptomatic persons may require admission to hospital because of respiratory or other complications. Individuals in this enhanced risk category may have one or more such factors, including age >50 years, comorbidities, history of significant tobacco smoking and underlying immunocompromising illnesses. [10, 13] In mild disease, especially in the early stages, the RT-PCR false negative rate is ~30 -40%. [8, 14, 15] A meta-analysis reported that a single test ~10 days post symptom development had an ~33% false negative rate using a nasopharyngeal swab (52.89% for a throat swab). [16] Ai et al. [17] reported a false negative rate of 41% in a cohort of 1 014 hospitalised patients; the estimated median (standard deviation) interval between the initial negative test and subsequent positive RT-PCR result was 5.1 (1.5) days. A selection of other studies reported false negative rates of between 3 and 29%. [18] [19] [20] Notably, some patients required up to five repeat tests before a positive result was ascertained. [19] This false negativity phenomenon may be the result of several factors, including a low viral load below the detection limit of the assay, low sample volume or cellular mass during acquisition, sampling location (upper v. lower respiratory tract), sample degradation during transport or storage, sample processing methodology and the timing of sampling in relation to the stage of the disease (RT-PCR positivity may progressively increase during the course of the disease). [14] Test accuracy will depend on the quality of the specimen collec ted. [20] It has since been shown that specimens from the lower respiratory tract have a higher viral load, and are hence more likely to test positive than specimens from the upper respiratory tract. [8, 21] Nasopharyngeal specimens have better yield than oropharyngeal samples. [8, 15] In hospitalised patients with severe disease, Wang et al. [8] found a sensitivity of 93% in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (a high aerosol-generating procedure), 72% in sputum and 63% in nasal swabs; sensitivity ranged from 0 to 32% in pharyngeal swabs, faeces, blood and urine. Given these considerations, a negative test from an upper respiratory tract specimen should be repeated after 1 -3 days (the optimal timing is unclear), or a lower respiratory tract specimen obtained to exclude a false negative result, if clinical suspicion is high. [22] Viral shedding in asymptomatic, early prodromal and minimally symptomatic individuals, and after resolution of symptoms, helps to explain the rapid and extensive spread of COVID-19. In patients with more severe disease, including those with lower respiratory tract infection, but also in individuals with mild disease, high viral loads can often be detected for several days after the resolution of symptoms. [23] The significance of this remains unclear, although recent data from a limited number of patients suggest that RT-PCR positivity does not necessarily mean shedding of infectious virus after symptom resolution. [11] Zhifeng et al. [24] demonstrated that RT-PCR using nasopharyngeal samples can be negative even when there is computed tomography scan evidence of COVID-19 pneumonia. [24] Ali et al. [17] showed an improvement in disease extent in 42% of CT scans prior to RT-PCR tests becoming negative. It is unclear whether patients whose symptoms have resolved but who continue to have detectable viral RNA in respiratory samples can transmit infection. Furthermore, when symptoms have resolved, and especially given limited testing capacity, it remains unclear when patients may be discharged from the intensive care unit into the general ward setting, or from hospital into the community, especially if there are other individuals with high-risk profiles living in the same household. Therefore there are no clearly defined guidelines as to when it is safe for social mixing to occur after symptoms have resolved. Healthcare worker safety must be taken into account when collecting sputum, which should ideally be performed in an infection-controlled environment, or in the open air in ambulant patients.",

[4] Generally, at least two target genes need to be identified for SARS-CoV-2 confirmation. However, interpretation algorithms differ with respect to the number of genes that need to be detected for the test to be considered positive. For some protocols, results are interpreted as indeterminate or negative if one of the genes is not detected, whereas for others, identification of one gene is used as screening test, while that of the subsequent gene(s) serves as a confirmatory test. [4] From a laboratory perspective, multiplexing of targets allows for better efficiency, shorter turnaround times and more optimal management of laboratory consumables. [26] Vogels et al. [27] evaluated nine primer-probe sets. They confirmed that each pair had a detection efficiency of >90%, but there were differences in the ability to differentiate true negatives from positives in patients with a low viral load. Some sets led to inconclusive results due to nonspecific background amplification (including the initial sets issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but with subsequent rectification). With viral evolution, nucleotide substitutions may emerge that could affect primer/probe binding regions that could alter the sensitivity of PCR. Indeed, a potentially problematic mismatch in the RdRp-SARSr reverse primer has already been confirmed. The threshold cycle value of the target gene remains the quantitative endpoint to ascertain viral load and, depending on the kit used, this value generally lies in the 30 -40 range. [4, 27] To control for nonspecific PCR inhibition, an internal positive amplification control (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 E-gene RNA, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 RNA) is included in the assay, while a negative control interrogates for contamination during sample preparation.",

Although well documented, it is not widely appreciated that between 10 and 20% of community-acquired pneumonia or acute lower respiratory tract infection in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia is due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis [41] [42] [43] , and this proportion is even higher in HIV-infected persons.

On the other hand, and particularly in HIV-infected persons, COVID-19 pneumonia, as in the case of influenza, [43] may be associated with a poorer prognosis in hospitalised patients with TB. Whether the SARS-CoV-2 viral load will be higher in HIV-infected persons, and therefore RT-PCR sensitivity better, remains unclear. In HIV-uninfected persons, co-infection with more than one pathogen has already been documented, e.g. co-infection with COVID-19 and influenza and/or bacterial organisms. [44] It is possible that co-infection with more than one pathogen may be more frequent in HIV-infected persons or those with advanced immunosuppression. These unanswered questions will only be resolved once more data become available.",

Although the mainstay of testing remains RT-PCR, there are several drawbacks, including a significant false negative rate in the early course of the disease, assay cost and lack of assay simplicity and the requirement for complex laboratory infrastructure. There is an emerging shortage of reagents, including RNA extraction kits, that is likely to worsen; already many centres are using dry nasopharyngeal swabs because of the shortage of viral transport medium. Antibody-based immunoassays have been developed, although they have a limited role in the early diagnosis of symptomatic patients. Their incremental benefit over RT-PCR assays, and their role in other applications, including surveillance and targeting of individuals for vaccination and redeployment into the workforce, are under investigation.",
