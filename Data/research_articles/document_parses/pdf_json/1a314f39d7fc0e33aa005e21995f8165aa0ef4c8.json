There is currently no specific drug for therapeutic treatment or for use as a prophylactic agent against infection and no commercially available vaccine. Prohibitin has been identified as a receptor protein used by chikungunya virus to enter mammalian cells. Recently, synthetic sulfonyl amidines and flavaglines (FLs), a class of naturally occurring plant compounds with potent anti-cancer and cytoprotective and neuroprotective activities, have been shown to interact directly with prohibitin. This study therefore sought to determine whether three prohibitin ligands (sulfonyl amidine 1 m and the flavaglines FL3 and FL23) were able to inhibit CHIKV infection of mammalian Hek293T/17 cells. All three compounds inhibited infection and reduced virus production when cells were treated before infection but not when added after infection. Pretreatment of cells for only 15 minutes prior to infection followed by washing out of the compound resulted in significant inhibition of entry and virus production. These results suggest that further investigation of prohibitin ligands as potential Chikungunya virus entry inhibitors is warranted.",

Sourisseau and colleagues proposed that CHIKV entry (into Hela cells) was via a clathrindependent pathway (16) ; however, Bernard and colleagues proposed that entry was via a clathrin-independent, Eps-15-dependent endocytic pathway (19) .

This study was undertaken to determine whether the interaction between flavaglines and PHB was sufficient to disrupt the interaction between PHB and CHIKV. All of our results are consistent with the compounds acting at the entry stage, possibly by physically interfering with the binding of CHIKV to the PHB receptor. The maximum inhibition observed was approximately 50% of viral entry (seen with pulse treatment of cells with FL3), a degree of inhibition consistent with that seen in previous antibody inhibition experiments (20) . The compounds tested showed little effect when added postentry; while this may suggest that flavaglines have only limited potential utility as prophylactic agents, because natural infections are not synchronous, administration during the course of the disease could have therapeutic effects by preventing new cells from becoming infected. The fact that both antibody inhibition experiments (20) and the compounds tested here showed a maximum effect on entry of about 50% may indicate that CHIKV uses multiple receptor protein to enter susceptible cells.",

However, no cytotoxicity was observed after exposure to dramatically higher doses when the compounds were administered as short (15 minute) pulses. Importantly, these compounds show no toxicity to normal cells and do not display any evidence of toxicity in vivo (33) , suggesting that these compounds, or indeed other ligands of PHB, could form the basis of a prophylactic or therapeutic regime in CHIKV outbreaks.",
