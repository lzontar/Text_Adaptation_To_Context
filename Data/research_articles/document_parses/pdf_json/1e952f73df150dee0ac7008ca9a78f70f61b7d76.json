Understanding the current epidemiological models for disease spread, mortality, and recovery is more important than ever before. One of the most relevant mathematical models relating to the spread of a pandemic is the susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model. Other models worth exploring are the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) and the susceptible-unquarantined-quarantinedconfirmed (SUQC) model.",

Physicians of various specialties have found themselves in the eye of the storm of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Physicians and physicianscientists are working around the clock to treat infected patients, educate the public about social distancing measures, and test potential treatments and vaccines. To fully understand the nature of the pandemic and the impact of social distancing measures, one must understand the mathematics behind it. One of the most relevant mathematical models relating to the spread of a pandemic is the susceptible-infectiousremoved (SIR) model and its variants. Unfortunately, the mathematical depth of this model can seem daunting to some physicians and physician-scientists. In this paper, we will try to explain and simplify the mathematics behind some of these epidemiological models.",

This type of model has been used in several studies analyzing the spread of COVID-19 [5] [6] [7] [8] . These models help us understand how COVID-19 spreads, predict the regional peaks of the pandemic, and understand the impact of various quarantine measures. All the epidemiological models, which we will discuss in this paper, are based on analyzing systems of differential equations. Differential equations focus on the rate of change of a variable, or group of variables as time passes. They are found in almost all aspects of medicine. They help us in dose medications, understand disease spread, and even dialyze patients. When more than one variable is involved, we usually need more than one differential equation to model a given situation. These are referred to as a system of differential equations. Let us begin with the most basic form of SIR models.",

In other words, all other variables evolve as a function of time. Let us use (S) to refer to the number of susceptible individuals at any given time (t). Another way to indicate that S is a dependent on time is to call it S(t). Similarly, I or I(t) represents the number of infectious individuals as a function of time. R or R(t) represents the number of removed individuals as function of time. Removed means that they are no longer contagious either because they recovered or because they died. The three dependent variables, S, I, and R, represent the three possible segments of a given population with N, number of people. This means that the sum of all three variables is equal to N [1 -3, 8] . Fig. 1 , we can see that as time passes by, S(t) decreases, while I(t) and R(t) decrease. The sum of the three variables at any given time remains constant as long as the total number of people in the population, N, is constant. If there is a significant change in N, the basic SIR model cannot be used, and a different epidemiological model would have to be used. If we focus on the infectious group, I(t), shown in red, we see that once it peaks, it starts to decrease again. That is because at some point in time, everyone who was infected will have to move to the removed group, R(t). Everyone with an infection has to either recover from the infection or die as a result of it at some point.",

One way to reduce the number of susceptible people is by vaccination. The second fact which affects disease spread is the number of infectious individuals, i(t). This can be reduced by isolating infectious individuals within a population and preventing the entry of more infectious individuals from other populations. Finally, the spread of the infection also depends on the rate of transmission of disease per contact. We will use the parameter, \u03b2, to represent the chance that an infectious individual will transmit the disease to a susceptible individual. It depends on the likelihood that an infectious individual comes in contact with a susceptible individual and the rate of disease transmission per contact [1-3, 8, 9] .

Since the number of susceptible people can only decrease over time, the rate of change for susceptible individuals must always be a negative number. The magnitude of this change depends on the ratio of infected individuals at any given time i(t), the ratio of susceptible individuals s(t), and the likelihood of disease transmission between the two groups, \u03b2. We will express the rate of change of susceptible individuals s(t), as a differential equation. The notation, d dt , simply indicates the rate of change over time. The rate of change of the susceptible individuals over time can be expressed as ds dt [1] [2] [3] [4] 8] . This slope is equal to ds dt . Notice how the slope is always negative. We can also see that the slope increases in magnitude at first but then starts to flatten. Figure 4 shows how changing the magnitude of \u03b2 impacts the susceptibility curve. When \u03b2 is relatively large, the infection spreads fast and the number of susceptible individuals drops quickly. When \u03b2 is relatively small, we see a flatter curve as the disease spread is slowed down.",

Several factors help reduce R 0 including social distancing, hand hygiene, and vaccination. R 0 can also be used to estimate the herd immunity threshold (HIT), which is the minimum ratio of individuals that must become immune to a disease so that it would die out (Fig. 10) .
