Unscheduled healthcare constitutes a substantial portion of healthcare delivery. A systematic review was conducted to establish the factors that influence parents' decision making when seeking unscheduled healthcare for their children. The systematic review question was \"What are the factors that influence the decision making of parents and families seeking unscheduled paediatric healthcare?\" Method: Five databases (CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS, PsycInfo, EconLit) and four grey literature databases (Proquest, Lenus, OpenGrey, Google Scholar) were searched. The titles and abstracts of 3746 articles were screened and full-text screening was performed on 177 of these articles. Fifty-six papers were selected for inclusion in the review. Data relating to different types of unscheduled health services (namely primary care, the emergency department and out-ofhours services) were extracted from these articles. A narrative approach was used to synthesise the extracted data.",

A number of the included studies identified pre-disposing factors such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) as impacting the healthcare-seeking behaviour of parents. Unscheduled healthcare use was often initiated by the parent's perception that the child's condition was urgent and their need for reassurance. The choice of unscheduled service was influenced by a myriad of factors such as: waiting times, availability of GP appointments, location of the ED, and the relationship that the parent or caregiver had with their GP.",

Health systems offer access to unscheduled care through numerous routes; however, it is typically provided by general practitioners (GPs), emergency medicine physicians in emergency departments (EDs) and by GPs in out-of-hours GP services such as practitioner cooperatives. Unscheduled healthcare constitutes a substantial portion of healthcare delivery. From 1996 to 2010, 47.7% of hospital-associated healthcare was delivered in emergency departments in the USA [2] and attendances at emergency departments have been rising steadily at an international level [3] . Children are some of the heaviest users of unscheduled healthcare [1] and young children make up a large proportion of ED attendances that may have been treatable at primary care [4] . Moreover, in England, unplanned paediatric hospital admissions are also rising, particularly from EDs, and evidence has shown that these are typically short stays for minor conditions that, while often necessary for younger children, may be treatable in the community [5] . There are multiple complex factors and circumstances that can influence parents' decision making regarding where, when and why they seek unscheduled healthcare for their children. At present, there is incomplete understanding of how parents and families make decisions when accessing unscheduled healthcare and the present review seeks to clarify this gap in the literature.",

Issues around access to and confidence in primary care are frequently cited as reasons for increased attendances at the ED, with the perceived urgency of the condition also noted [7] [8] [9] . Other pragmatic concerns that influence patients can be costs associated with certain services within the health systems and availability of transport to and from healthcare services [7] . Individual patient factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) can also dictate where care is sought with low SES typically associated with higher use of the ED [10] [11] [12] , however, this is mediated by many complex interacting factors that require further exploration.",

The variety of services that offer unscheduled healthcare has given rise to the argument that they should be studied as one system rather than as individual components within a health system [1, 18] . There is little evidence regarding the utilisation of unscheduled healthcare as a single system with multiple options that offer unplanned healthcare when needed, and critically, how patients make decisions about care seeking within that system. Many potential factors that influence where patients choose to seek care exist and accessibility and convenience also shape their care-seeking behaviour. This may result in a blurring of the boundaries between the types of unscheduled care on offer, which can be confusing for patients as they try to navigate this complex system and seek the most appropriate care [19] .",

SES was typically reported using measures such as income, education, and deprivation level of the area where participants were living. The relationship between SES and child health is well documented [79] , however, given the multi-faceted nature of SES, we only extracted data where SES measures were explicitly stated by the authors to be a factor that influenced attendance or care-seeking at unscheduled healthcare. SES interacts with factors such as race and ethnicity, which can also incorporate language and level of acculturation into the main culture [79] . These findings need to be balanced against the health system in which they occur with regards to local and structural issues and therefore, the countries in which such findings emerged are stated in Table 4 . Immigrant and minority populations were found to be more likely to use the ED as a source of first-contact care [40, 73] with lower levels of acculturation related to even greater use of the ED in Latin American populations in the USA [73] , and low abilities in the native language also associated with higher ED use in Sweden [40] . Health literacy, which has been defined as the \"skills that determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health\" [81] , was also a relevant factor [56] with lower levels of health literacy associated with greater ED use [57] . Other factors included lower income [34] and use of public health insurance programmes based on income such as Medicaid in the USA [27, 51, 61] or a lack of any health insurance [64] . In one study from Brazil, parents often utilised private healthcare as a substitute for public health services when they were unavailable, Children whose mothers reported that they had (1) asthma diagnosed by a physician, (2) day or night asthma symptoms, including wheezing, shortness of breath, and/or a cough at least once a week during the past 2 weeks, and/or (3) at least 1 visit for asthma to the ED in the previous 6 months or 1 overnight hospitalization for asthma in the previous year.",

While the clinical reason for attendance was not a primary focus of the current review, which sought to collate non-clinical factors, it is difficult to completely isolate the non-clinical factors from the clinical reason for attendance. Indeed, as a common childhood condition, asthma was central to a number of the included studies (n = 4). With regards to children with asthma, minority children were more likely to utilise urgent care compared to non-minority children in the USA when other relevant factors were controlled for including income, gender, source of usual asthma care [42] and frequency of night-time symptoms [69] . Moreover, among a predominantly Latino population in an American hospital, perception of acute need was the main reason parents sought the ED for their children with asthma, however, those who use the ED do so due to barriers using primary care for unscheduled appointments [54] .",

For instance, mothers who reported as being in the highest tertile of depression were more likely to bring their child to the ED rather than the GP [30] and younger parental age which was associated with a greater likelihood to seek care at the ED [34] . In a study exploring care seeking in lone parents in the UK with a partner on active duty abroad, a lack of support at home increased the likelihood that they would seek care when their child was unwell [32] . This latter finding is analogous to other studies which found that being a single-parent was a risk factor for higher ED use for non-urgent conditions [61, 76] , such that parents with limited social support were more frequent ED attenders [37] and living in low income areas made the ED a more convenient choice for stressed families [38] .",

Specifically, parents wanted reassurance that their child's illness is not serious or will not become more urgent, while also seeking guidance on how to manage the condition [25, 37, 41, 56, 60, 82] . Reassurance and seeking guidance on how to manage specific conditions such as respiratory tract infections (RTI) [49, 71] and for general illnesses [66] also factored into the decision of parents choosing to attend their GP. Parental self-efficacy and ability to cope tended to increase with more parental experience due to having other children, and this in turn influenced the decision to consult healthcare for RTIs [49, 50] . Moreover, while social pressures to seek care for their children in order to be seen to be 'doing the right thing' as a parent [66] was also related to care seeking, fear of wasting the doctor's time for a minor illness was perceived as a barrier to seeking primary care [49] .",

This finding also relates to the diagnostic and other equipment typically available in a hospital setting but not in a GP practice. Parents stated that they preferred the ED as diagnostics such as blood tests and X-rays can be carried out immediately, and they believed their child would get a more thorough examination by doctors in a paediatric ED [25, 28, 33] . Parental trust in ED doctors was also an important factor when seeking care for injuries [44] . On balance, dissatisfaction with the ED, including disappointment with medical staff, care and information, increased the likelihood of a return visit to the ED in one study [29] .",

However, experience was also a key factor and parents who had used a GP cooperative previously were more likely to do so again [63] . Waiting times and convenience were also key factors in the use of out-of-hours' services, and patients with knowledge of the system were more likely to utilise it [55] .

This initial decision to seek care is rarely a straightforward one for parents and anxiety can be heightened when making decisions for others, such as young children who may struggle to communicate their symptoms [85] . A common focus of the studies included in the review was the use of the ED for low-acuity or non-urgent conditions, however, it is difficult to synthesise these findings as there was considerable heterogeneity in how non-urgent or low-acuity conditions were defined by researchers. This is reflected in the literature where there is a lack of agreement among ED physicians on how to define an \"inappropriate\" visit to the ED [85] , and while they recognise that certain illnesses and conditions can be treated elsewhere, they do not always consider such visits to be problematic [86] . In the present review, parents did take the appropriateness of an ED visit into account [49] and indeed, it was clear that parents do make attempts to contact a GP ahead of attending the ED [40, 43] . Navigating \"appropriate\" use of the unscheduled healthcare system can be challenging for patients [19] and a more nuanced understanding of how parents make sense of illness and urgency of care seeking is required.",

For instance, socioeconomically disadvantaged and immigrant parents were typically more likely to seek healthcare in the ED, with this effect observed in Australia, Brazil, and the USA in the articles in the current review [34, 35, 51, 61, 64, 69, 73] . However, at the core of access and availability to unscheduled healthcare are practical issues and concerns that families must consider when seeking healthcare, and it is important to recognise that constraints within a health system can limit the options for some parents regarding where to initiate contact with the health service. For instance, the unavailability of appointments with the GP within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., within 24 h) causes parents to seek healthcare in the ED [26] , and the times of available appointments can also be restrictive as they are typically during standard working hours. Parents also perceive access to diagnostic tests and the specialist equipment available in a hospital as important [25] , or may go straight to the ED to avoid having to \"wait twice\" if they think they will be sent on to the ED by their GP anyway [46] . Due to the temporal structure of primary care and the limited diagnostic tests available, attendances at EDs for non-urgent conditions are often inevitable, therefore, strategies for reducing \"inappropriate\" visits to the ED could instead focus on investment in primary care to take the pressure of EDs and provide greater care in the community.",

For example, in a study from Hong Kong, which has a primary care system dominated by private healthcare, patients with higher incomes and private health insurance reported favourable experiences in primary care [88] . In the present review, an unsatisfactory relationship with your GP was related to higher use of the ED [33] and evidence suggests that families with high income and education were more likely to report a positive relationship with their child's GP, and reported greater involvement in decision making around their child's health [89] .

It is clear from the current findings that while parents may utilise different health services as a source of unscheduled healthcare, they are using these different services for similar reasons and also operating within constraints that exist in their health system. Furthermore, the persistent framing of non-urgent, low-acuity or 'unnecessary' visits to the ED as problematic behaviour on the part of parents may be shifting focus away from the challenges in the system of unscheduled healthcare that result in this behaviour. While targeted interventions that improve health literacy can reduce presentations to the ED [87] and educate parents on management of minor childhood illnesses, understanding parents' behaviour as part of a system of unscheduled healthcare should be an important priority for future research. Such research can inform policy and practice in this area by identifying opportunities for intervention that are responsive to parents' behaviour and needs. Finally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric attendance to EDs has been noted [80, 90] , and it is likely that this has impacted parental decision-making when seeking unscheduled care more broadly, however, further research is needed to understand decision-making during the pandemic [91] .",

Some health systems provide telephone advice services where patients can speak with healthcare professionals for advice on whether to attend the ED or to receive guidance on how to manage a condition, although the evidence around these service is unclear [1] . On a related note, much of the literature made reference to parents phoning their GP for advice ahead of attending the ED, however, the outcomes of the calls were not consistently reported and it is difficult to ascertain the impact this had on attendance. Chronic conditions such as asthma will increase attendance at unscheduled services, however, this attendance is still heavily influenced by the issues brought up in the review.

Parental decisions on when and where to seek unscheduled healthcare for their children are not made in a vacuum as parents weigh up the options in front of them, utilise prior experiences and make the most appropriate decision in any given context. While a strong system of primary care has been associated with more positive population health outcomes [93] , access issues that are faced by subsections of the population and the practical considerations of parents are substantial limitations that need to be addressed. Policy and planning initiatives do not always reflect how patients negotiate the health system as a single entity with numerous entry points [19, 85] . Altering patients' behaviour through public health initiatives that seek to improve, for instance, health literacy [87] or reducing emergency hospital admissions through preventative primary care [9] requires an understanding of the relative importance of factors that influence behaviour and decision making, and the interactions between these factors.",
