Eight of them received at least one organ support. Median H-score was 208 (probability of HLH according to the score, 92.5%), and all patients had at least 4 to 7 criteria of the modified 2009 HLH criteria (genetic testing and NK cell activity were not available; sCD25 was tested in one patient). Causes of HLH were multiples: autoimmune diseases in four, infection (bacterial or viral) in three, and idiopathic in two. In addition to tocilizumab (8 mg/kg once, intravenously), five patients received concomitant treatment with dexamethasone (n = 4), cyclophosphamide (n = 2), or intravenous immunoglobulins (n = 1). Remission was observed in 8/9 patients after tocilizumab (88.9%) whereas one developed refractory HLH, also unresponsive to rescue therapy with etoposide. Ferritin progressively decreased over the first 2 weeks (Fig. 1 ). One patient relapsed during the hospitalization and successfully received etoposide, but she ultimately died from unrelated gut ischemia. No patient developed profound neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm 3 ), except one who had also received cyclophosphamide. During the hospitalization, four patients died (sepsis-related multi-organ failure n = 1; refractory HLH n = 1; organ support limitation n = 2). None developed HLH relapse beyond the current hospitalization. Cytomegalovirus prophylaxis was pursued at least 3 months in transplant recipients.",

HLH 94 and 2004 protocols were developed for children with primary HLH (50% successes), but adult patients may be more at risk to develop chemotherapy toxicities [1] . Alternatives should thus be discussed in adult patients with chemotherapy-induced bone marrow failure, underlying autoimmune diseases requiring cytotoxic agents, or with a moderate form of HLH not related to hematological malignancies. In line with this need, the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was tested in a mouse model of genetic HLH. Its benefits were confirmed in patients with reactive HLH [5] , but the oral administration may preclude its pharmacokinetic in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Due to its intravenous administration, tocilizumab may thus be a valuable alternative after ruling out on-going bacterial or fungal sepsis.",
