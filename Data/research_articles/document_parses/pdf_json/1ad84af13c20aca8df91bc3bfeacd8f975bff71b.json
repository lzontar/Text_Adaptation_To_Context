Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may be a consequence of COVID-19 and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) may be offered to patients. This strategy is being used at specialized centers for the treatment of severe cases unable to be supported by traditional mechanical ventilation (1) . Typically, the patient's venous system is drained through single femoral vein and an internal jugular vein is then utilized to return oxygenated blood to the system, bypassing the injured lungs. This process requires chronic anticoagulation to avoid thrombosis and circuit failure. There are limited reports of epistaxis and/or upper airway hemorrhage management in ECMO patients in the literature, and none detailing protocols for actively infected patients in the midst of a global pandemic (2) .",

Only a single provider was in the patient room during the procedure. The personal protective equipment (PPE) used by the physician included disposable surgical cap, gown, gloves and powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) with face shield or N-95 mask with eye/face protection (Figure 1 ). Providers were trained in proper donning and doffing protocols for PPE. A handheld light source and overhead lighting were used in all cases. A headlight was not used because a model compatible with the PPE was not immediately available. A headlight may also be less advantageous because adjustments during the procedure increase the risk of contamination. All possible supplies necessary were carried into the room to minimize need for exit and re-entry. Because of the diffuse nature of the bleeding encountered, endoscopy was of little utility and was avoided as it could exacerbate bleeding and cause further aerosolization of secretions. Suctioning was also avoided for the same reasons. Placement of absorbable packing was preferred to limit the number of procedures required to temporize the nasal bleeding. This minimizes the need to remove permanent packing such as petrolatum gauze or polyvinyl alcohol sponge (Merocel\u00ae) which could risk rebleeding and requires further instrumentation. Nasal sprays, such as oxymetazoline, were not recommended in these cases to minimize aerosolization. If needed, it should be applied using soaked pledgets rather than spraying.",

Instrumentation of the upper airway is commonly required in critically ill patients and often causes mucosal trauma which triggers bleeding. Additionally, mechanical obstruction of the internal jugular vein or superior vena cava by large ECMO cannulas may cause venous congestion, increasing the propensity for persistent hemorrhage.",
