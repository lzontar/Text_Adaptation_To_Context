            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cause important health problems in all cattle husbandry systems. It contributes substantially to the use of antimicrobial substances and compromises animal welfare and the sustainability of the cattle industry. The existing preventive measures of BRD focus at the individual animal or herd level and include vaccination, mass treatment with antimicrobials and improvement of the animal's environment and general health status. Despite progress in our understanding of disease mechanism and technological development, the current preventive measures are not sufficiently effective. Thus, there is a need for alternative, sustainable strategies to combat the disease. Some of the primary infectious agents in the BRD complex are viruses that are easily transmitted between herds such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). This conceptual analysis presents arguments for combatting BRD through improved external biosecurity in the cattle herds. As an example of a population-based approach to the control of BRD, the Norwegian BRSV/BCoV control-program is presented. The program is voluntary and launched by the national cattle industry. The core principle is classification of herds based on antibody testing and subsequent prevention of virus-introduction through improved biosecurity measures. Measures include external herd biosecurity barriers and regulations in the organization of animal trade to reduce direct and indirect transmission of virus. Improved biosecurity in a large proportion of herds will lead to a considerable effect at the population level. Positive herds are believed to gain freedom by time if new introduction is avoided. Vaccination is not used as part of the program. Dissemination of information to producers and veterinarians is essential. We believe that reducing the incidence of BRD in cattle is essential and will lead to reduced antimicrobial usage while at the same time improving animal health, welfare and production. Alternative approaches to the traditional control measures are needed.",

The disease is multifactorial and develops in complex interaction between factors associated with the host, the pathogens and the environment. The existing preventive measures therefore include a wide range of strategies. Despite advances of newer and better therapeutic and preventive medications, as well as efforts to improve management and optimize the environment to prevent BRD, the morbidity and mortality rates have not declined. A recent review of evolving views on BRD control measures concludes that blanket vaccination and mass treatment provides inconstant control for BRD and highlights the need to reappraise the use of these measures (1) . Our question is, however, if there are alternative strategies to antimicrobial treatment and vaccines that could be effective in reducing the impact of BRD in a sustainable cattle production.",

It is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and economic loss in both the beef and dairy cattle industries (7, 8) . Fatalities, treatment costs, and handling of sick animals contribute to the economic losses in the acute stage of an outbreak. Considerably higher number of animals are usually found to have lung-lesions at slaughter, compared to the number of clinical BRD cases in a herd. This indicates that observed clinical cases represent only part of the problem (9) . The longterm consequences are also less recognized, but reduced feed conversion, growth rate and performance might contribute considerably to the total economic losses. A long-term reduction in weight gain (7 months) was seen following a BRD outbreak among bulls in Norway (10) . Calves with BRD have also been found to produce less milk when they reach first lactation (11) . National studies from the UK have estimated costs associated with BRD amounting to \u00a380 million annually for the cattle industry (12) . The only scientific publication where the nationallevel economic effect of BRD has been estimated is from France, where an epidemiology-and productivity model was used to link BRD incidence with productivity in the different cattle industry sectors (13) . The authors found that eradication of BRD in beef calves would increase the whole beef sector's productivity by 4.7-5.5%, but that the benefits from eradication would differ between enterprises. For example, young bull and veal feedlot enterprises were estimated to increase in productivity by 8.7-12.8% while the breeding farms would gain less (5.1-6.0%) (13) .",

A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials concluded that antimicrobial prophylaxis and metaphylaxis demonstrated moderate, yet highly variable reductions in the relative risk of BRD morbidity (19) . The most substantial reductions of relative risk were from critically important broad-spectrum antimicrobials. However, metaphylactic treatment with macrolides were found to have no effect on incidence of BRD in a controlled trial (20) . In addition, a high prevalence of multidrug resistant Mannheimia haemolytica has been found in cattle after metaphylaxis and treatment for BRD (21) . Baptiste and Kyvsgaard (19) also concluded that BRD prophylaxis/metaphylaxis represents a major driver of antimicrobial consumption for highly variable short-term gains in terms of absolute risk reduction of morbidity and mortality. The use of mass medication can hardly be seen as in accordance with the current strategy to prevent antimicrobial resistance through prudent use of antibiotics recommended by the World Health Organization, United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization and World Organization for Animal Health (14) . It is therefore necessary to promote control of BRD without the use of antimicrobial mass-medication.",

The effect of vaccination on herd immunity depends on the efficacy of the vaccine, but also on vaccine management such as the proportion of animals vaccinated and the timing of vaccination (23) . Several authors have reviewed the vaccine efficacy of BRD vaccines, with conflicting results in calves and feedlot cattle (24, 25) , and a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effect of commercially available BRD vaccines showed no significant difference in the risk of BRD in vaccinated calves, compared to controls (26) .

Annual and seasonal variation in mortality rates due to BRD have been documented, with increased rates during winter (3, 29) . This has been partially explained by higher animal density during confined housing, poor ventilation and inclement weather (12) . Studies from Scandinavia have found that reduction of the animal density and age span in group-pens along with 1 week of isolation of new-borns from adult cows may prevent BRD (30, 31) . Nevertheless, maintenance of good health alone does not result in sufficient reduction of BRD (8) , and despite education and consulting of producers on optimal management strategies, it may be difficult to achieve the desired results.",

National level biosecurity implies that restrictions on import of live animals and biological products are in place to protect a population from introduction of new infectious agents. External biosecurity refers to measures aiming at preventing introduction of disease into herds. Internal biosecurity relates to limiting transmission of infectious agents between animals or groups within a herd. For BRD, internal biosecurity measures have been reviewed with a focus on factors that limit pathogen exposure within the herds such as vaccination, housing, ventilation and control of other diseases (33) . In the following, herd level biosecurity will refer to external biosecurity at the herd level, which so far has received little, if any, attention regarding BRD. The general herd level biosecurity is relatively low in modern cattle production, also compared to other livestock species such as poultry and swine (34, 35) . Few biosecurity measures are usually undertaken, resulting in a constant risk of disease transmission between farms. Implementation of biosecurity measures is hampered by factors such as cost, perceived usefulness, workload and lack of clarity as to how and why measures should be undertaken (34, (36) (37) (38) (39) . Improved herd level biosecurity can be implemented in single herds, or on a regional or national level. To justify efforts to control BRD through improved herd level biosecurity, the following questions need to be addressed: is BRD a transmissible disease between herds? If so, is it possible to stop the transmissible infectious agents at the farm gate? And can these agents be eliminated from infected herds?",

Viral pathogens such as BRSV, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine viral diarrhea virus and BCoV can cause disease directly, and/or predispose animals to bacterial infections (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) . Most of these primary BRD pathogens are highly contagious viruses that can easily spread between herds (29, 44) , either directly through live animal contact/movement, or indirectly through contaminated environment or fomites brought between herds. The most common bacterial agents are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni (44) (45) (46) . These bacteria appear to have lower transmissibility, and bacterial disease in several animals is therefore most likely a result of exposure of animals to the same risk factors, such as virus infection and/or suboptimal environment, at the same time (47) . Mycoplasma bovis can also contribute to BRD, either as primary or secondary pathogen. Live animal movement seems to be the primary means by which M. bovis is transmitted between herds (48) .",

Modes of transmission are either directly through live animal contact (59) or indirectly via contaminated personnel or utensils brought between herds (60). Herds with limited or no purchase of cattle may also experience outbreaks of BRD, most likely due to introduction of infectious agents by indirect routes, and/or that the causative pathogen was already circulating in the herd (61) . Indirect transmission depends upon the stability of the viruses outside the host, which is generally short for enveloped RNA viruses such as BRSV and BCoV. However, there are uncertainties regarding the stability of both viruses. Under laboratory conditions, BCoV remained infective for 2 weeks under cool and moist conditions (62) . For both BRSV and BCoV, temporary carriage of virus on fomites has been shown: infective BCoV was detected on fomites (clothes, boots and equipment) 24 h after exposure to virus-shedding calves, while for BRSV, only viral RNA, and no infectious virus, was detected (60) . The same study found that personnel in contact with virus-shedding calves carried both BCoV and BRSV RNA on nasal mucosa, but none were positive for infective virions. It was therefore concluded that transmission of virus via human nasal mucosa is likely limited (60) . Airborne transmission for BRSV and BCoV has been shown indoors (63) but is most likely restricted to droplet and aerosol spread. Airborne transmission across longer distances, i.e., between farms, has not been described and is likely of limited importance. Transmission of virus from other species to cattle has never been demonstrated and is likely to be of minor importance under normal circumstances.",

When BRSV and BCoV cause acute infections in individual animals, the viruses replicate locally in the respiratory epithelial cells and are shed in exhaled air and nasal secretions (43, 51) . BCoV also infects enterocytes and is excreted in feces (43) . Experimental studies have shown shedding of BRSV from day three to nine post infection (46) , and from day two to ten for BCoV (66, 67) . Viral RNA can be detected for an extended period (67, 68), but might not represent infective virus. Both infections give short-lived immunity (69) (70) (71) . Introduction of virus to a herd usually results in rapid spread and high within-herd prevalence. This is particularly seen during the winter season (50, 72) . Depending on factors such as herd size, management and the immunity of the herd, viruses may continue to circulate due to subclinical infections in na\u00efve animals and/or reinfections with viral shedding in seropositive animals (43, 73) .",

Molecular epidemiology supports this viewvirus varies both temporally and spatially between outbreaks, suggesting that outbreaks are caused by introduction of new virus rather than through reactivation or the existence of carrier animals (78) (79) (80) .

Is this achievable? The answer depends on cultural and structural conditions of the cattle industry in the area of interest. Introduction of virus could, in principle, be prevented in any herd. However, a synergetic effect can be acquired if measures are implemented by most of the herds in an area or country. How successful a herd's biosecurity measures are also depend upon the infectious pressure from the outside. If this is reduced due to better biosecurity in surrounding herds, the benefit will be mutual. A central, joint organization to run a program through is therefore an advantage. In Norway, the largest dairy company (TINE SA) is a co-operative owned by the producers and 96% of the dairy herds report to the Norwegian dairy herd recording system, where membership is voluntary (81) . This probably contributes to high compliance in voluntary control efforts established by the industry.",

Bulk tank milk serology can provide an estimate of herd-level seroprevalence of BRSV and BCoV (90) . The method is cheap, but the result only reflect that there has been virus present in the herd during the last years. Sampling of a group of younger animals has also been used, with the assumption that the selected animals are representative for their age group in the herd e.g., pooled milk samples from primiparous cows. As they usually are 2-3 years old, the sample will reflect a herd's infection-history 2-3 years prior (77) . Serum from a group of calves under 1 year of age will indicate virus circulation within the last year, if calves young enough to have maternal antibodies are excluded. Classification of herds based on serological analysis of a group of animals is therefore possible, and the different options have pros and cons with regard to cost and value. We reiterate that the gap between seropositivity and virus presence is considerable. A seronegative herd is, on the other hand, a good indicator of a virus-free herd, and in the context of a control program, finding the free herds might be most important.",

Knowledge about the occurrence of the infections is useful to motivate action. The impact of BRD is well-recognized among farmers and veterinarians in Norway, and they are usually aware that BRSV and BCoV are the primary pathogens, and that BCoV also causes winter dysentery. This probably makes it easier to motivate the producers for control of BRSV and BCoV in Norway compared to countries with other Specters of BRD pathogens. For BRSV and BCoV, the documented varying prevalence, and presence of negative herds in high-prevalence areas (50, 59) , shows the Norwegian producers that it is possible to stay negative also if neighbors are positive. For regions with higher prevalence of BRSV and BCoV, an important step forward would be to perform an antibody-screening with a classification method that gives a recent picture, for example investigation of first-parity cows or young stock before concluding that all herds are positive. For countries with severe problems due to other BRD pathogens such as BVDV, M. bovis and IBR, it is probably wise to focus on these pathogens first.

The within-herd prevalence is to some degree unknown and probably variable between herds, and within groups in the herds, which further complicates the matter. In the control program, the testresult is valid for a full year. The probability of virus introduction after classification is considerable, particularly in herds that purchase animals.

Control of these highly contagious viruses require a systematic approach, and a cooperative culture with a common goal. Previous experience from systematic eradication and control of other diseases might have contributed to a culture for disease control through prevention and joint efforts in Norway. Successful control of BRSV and BCoV here could motivate to action also in other countries. Effects on public health is a profound reason for animal disease control. The expected benefits is considerable regarding the usage of antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance, in agreement with the present OIE strategy (90) . Another expected \"by-product\" of the control program is the likely reduction of infections caused by other pathogens transmitted via the same routes, both endemic and emerging pathogens. The Norwegian BRSV and BCoV control program indicates a way forward in how to achieve improved animal health and welfare.",

Growing concerns regarding the environmental impacts of livestock calls for new and innovative measures to prevent endemic diseases, and thereby improve the sustainability of the cattle industry. An alternative strategy to combat BRD is urgently needed. We believe it is both desirable and possible to control BRSV and BCoV, and subsequently reduce BRD, through biosecurity measures. The Norwegian initiative represents a new way of thinking that will likely have wider implications. The ultimate goal is improved animal health, welfare and a reduction in antimicrobial usage in the cattle sector as well as a more effective production.",
