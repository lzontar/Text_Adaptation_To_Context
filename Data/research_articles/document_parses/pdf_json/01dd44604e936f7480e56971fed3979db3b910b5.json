Despite considerable efforts to develop suitable computational methods, predicting protein-protein interaction binding affinity changes following mutation (\u0394\u0394G) remains a severe challenge. Algebraic topology, a champion in recent worldwide competitions for protein-ligand binding affinity predictions, is a promising approach to simplifying the complexity of biological structures. Here we introduce element-and site-specific persistent homology (a new branch of algebraic topology) to simplify the structural complexity of protein-protein complexes and embed crucial biological information into topological invariants. We also propose a new deep learning algorithm called NetTree to take advantage of convolutional neural networks and gradient-boosting trees. A topology-based network tree is constructed by integrating the topological representation and NetTree for predicting protein-protein interaction \u0394\u0394G.

The antibody-antigen system is one of the most essential among all PPIs and plays a unique role in the study of PPIs. Antibodies are large proteins that serve important roles in the immune system by counteracting antigens-chemicals recognized as alien by the human body. On the tip of an antibody, there is an antigen-binding fragment that contains a paratope for recognizing a unique antigen via its epitope; more specifically, a paratope consists of a set of complementarity-determining regions that have the highest conformational flexibility among sites on an antibody 1 . The high selectivity of antibody-antigen recognition mechanism and the flexibility of antibodies as large proteins make antibodies a suitable platform for designing counteractants of target molecules. Antibodies have been widely used as therapeutic agents to treat human diseases. Antibody therapy has several advantages over traditional therapy, including longer serum half-life, higher avidity and selectivity, and the ability to invoke desired immune responses [2] [3] [4] .

A reverse mutation from 'B' to ' A' is considered to be the same mutation type as from ' A' to 'B' , and the associated energy change admits an opposite sign (the mutations count for each mutation type can be found in Supplementary Fig. 1) . Overall, our predicted patterns are remarkably similar to those of experimental data in terms of both average binding energy changes and variance of binding energy changes, as shown in Fig. 5 . It is interesting to note that all the mutations to alanine have a positive energy change-a possible reason is that mutations from a large residue to a small one could lead to a stabilizing effect to the whole system. Aside from the size of amino acids, we also categorized them into charged, polar, hydrophobic and special-case groups. In terms of binding affinity changes, we find that most mutations from polar to hydrophobic residues have a positive free energy change (for example, S to M), which means mutations from polar residues to hydrophobic residues would make the whole PPI system more stable. We also observed that a mutation from charged residues to uncharged polar residues could lead to a negative energy change; for example, lysine to serine (K to S), which means such mutations might have broken some charge-charge interaction pairs. Although our model shares a similar pattern in the variance of energy changes with experimental data, the variance of the model predictions is generally lower than the experimental data as shown in Fig. 5 .
