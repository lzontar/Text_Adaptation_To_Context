Both intravenous zanamivir and oseltamivir use were associated with lower aHR for death when modeled as timedependent exposures. The observed mortality rate was lower but consistent with retrospective cohort studies of critically ill hospitalized patients with influenza during this time period [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . For example, in critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A/H1N1pdm09, a 50% ICU mortality rate has been reported [25] , and a California-cohort study in 1950 patients reported a 25% mortality rate with neuraminidase treatment (median time from symptom onset, 4 days) and a 42% mortality rate without treatment [26] . Of the 26 deaths in this study, none was thought by the treating physician to be attributable to zanamivir. The small number of pregnant women did well clinically, with no observed adverse fetal effects.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 738, "end": 742, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 743, "end": 747, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 748, "end": 752, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 753, "end": 757, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 758, "end": 762, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 763, "end": 767, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 886, "end": 890, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1087, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Influenza viral load analyses suggested that intravenous zanamivir had a rapid antiviral effect, with a median decrease in viral load of 1.42 log 10 copies/mL after 2 days of treatment, despite the presence of symptoms for a median of 4.5 days before study entry and prior use of oseltamivir in 80% of patients. This viral load reduction is consistent with findings of previous studies of inhaled zanamivir in acute uncomplicated seasonal influenza and limited data from hospitalized patients during the pandemic [27, 28] . In a Hong Kong study of 66 adults with influenza A/H1N1pdm09, patients with severe pneumonia experienced a longer duration of viral RNA positivity (by nasopharyngeal swab sample) after starting oseltamivir treatment (median, 6 days; range, 3-8) than those with milder illness (median, 2 days; range, 1-3) [29] . In our study, higher virus loads were observed in endotracheal samples than in simultaneous nasopharyngeal samples, reflecting the lower respiratory tract burden of influenza illness in this patient population [30] . In this study, we found a poor correlaton between the qVC and qRT-PCR results. The reason is not clear, but the qRT-PCR data were considered more reliable and have been presented to describe antiviral efficacy. In most cases, the causal connection between AEs and zanamivir was confounded by influenza severity, underlying medical conditions, and numerous concomitant medications, including antibiotics in 92% (data not shown). Protocol-defined liver events were observed in 13% of the study population; in all patients except 1 who died imminently of cardiogenic shock, liver enzyme elevations resolved with resolution of influenza or critical illness. Intravenous zanamivir was not noted to increase liver chemistry values in phase I healthy volunteer studies or preclinical animal safety studies [31, 32] . In our study, liver events did not correlate with higher zanamivir exposure, and there were no overall increases or discernible pattern in liver enzyme results, with many patients experiencing liver enzyme elevations at baseline, during treatment, or after treatment. Liver enzyme elevation has also been described in critically ill patients with influenza A/ H1N1pdm09 [33] . It is unclear whether intravenous zanamivir had a role in causing or exacerbating underlying liver inflammation. To address this uncertainty further, a current phase 3 trial of intravenous zanamivir in hospitalized adults with influenza is testing 2 dose levels of intravenous zanamivir (600 or 300 mg twice daily) and comparing them with oral oseltamivir (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01231620).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 513, "end": 517, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 518, "end": 521, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 829, "end": 833, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1050, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1856, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1857, "end": 1860, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2233, "end": 2237, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Zanamivir pharmacokinetic parameters in this severely ill population were generally consistent with results of previous studies in healthy volunteers [34] , although variability was greater.
