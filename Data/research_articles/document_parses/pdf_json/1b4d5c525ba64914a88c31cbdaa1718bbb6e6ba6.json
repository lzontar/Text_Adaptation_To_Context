MP in association with immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus and thalidomide is being tested in a phase III (NCT04341038) and a phase II (NCT04273581) trial, respectively, in patients at high risk for cytokine storm development.Finally, the REMAP-CAP (Randomized Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for CAP) is an adaptive research platform for the evaluation of multiple treatment modalities in the event of a respiratory pandemic resulting in critical illness, that has set-up a sub-platform called \"REMAP-COVID\" (NCT02735707) for the evaluation of specific treatments for COVID-19. In particular, the aim of this study is to assess the effect of a range of interventions including hydrocortisone to improve the outcome of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to ICU.ConclusionsSynthetic GC represent a well-known, cheap, widely available and easily manageable class of drugs used in a variety of settings, particularly for their immunosuppressive activities. Inthis work, we have synthesized their principal mechanisms of action and their putative role in turning off an exaggerated immune response starting in the lung alveoli of 20% of patients that develop COVID-19. Despite a previous lack of evidence of a clear benefit for patient survival outcomes, GC have been used in clinical practice for the management of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, for their hypothetical benefit on respiratory function and consequently their potential effect on reducing the number of patients requiring invasive procedures (i.e., ventilation or intubation). Indeed, in such health emergency situation, clinicians have employed GC as an \"accepted\" J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f therapy, for their reasonable expectation of success in the treatment of individual patients [k] .Thus, GC have been administered according to physician's judgment, based on the patient's best interest. To this end, the use of these immunosuppressive drugs has been considered reasonable despite the risk of developing adverse events and that of delaying the clearance of the virus, the resolution of the respiratory failure being the biggest issue in the phases IIb and III of COVID-19 patients. This intervention was reasonable when treating and individual patient, particularly when facing with the lack of effective drugs that had been proven to be effective so far in this disease. Thus physicians were ethically allowed to use an unproven intervention if they judged it helpful for saving lives, re-establishing health and alleviating suffering (Declaration of Helsinki[l]  ). However, this approach did not apply to the main purpose of research, which requires testing a hypothesis, giving rise to new generalizable knowledge[k]  . A step forward would be represented by the publication of the results of the RECOVERY RCT[b]  , revealing a death risk reduction for patients on ventilators and on O2 therapy.Further, considering that in most of the institutions, GC have been given in association with other complementary compounds, such as anti-viral, anti-malarial and anti-rheumatic agents, serine protease inhibitors, IL blockers, and LMWH, nowadays it is difficult to evaluate whether the benefits for patients are associated with single versus the combination of all these drugs. In order to prove the efficacy of GC in the management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it would have been necessary the design of phase III RCT with at least two arms, one including standard treatment plus GC versus one including standard treatment plus a placebo, and to further conduct subgroup analyses by age, comorbidities and, as previously said the possible use of other complementary drugs.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Among pts admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia, the panel suggests against the use of GC.

He earned his PhD in Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences in October 2017 at the Universit\u00e8 Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium), under the supervision of Prof. Martine Piccart and Dr. Karen Willard-Gallo. His thesis focused on the importance of CD4 + follicular helper T cells and tertiary lymphoid structures in the anti-tumor immune response to breast cancer, performed at the Institut Jules Bordet (Brussels, Belgium). He joined CCTI in February 2018, to work with Dr. Pawel J. Muranski on basic and translational tumor immunology with a focus on T cell biology and adoptive immunotherapy of cancer and viral diseases, with the goal of developing new treatments for patients.
