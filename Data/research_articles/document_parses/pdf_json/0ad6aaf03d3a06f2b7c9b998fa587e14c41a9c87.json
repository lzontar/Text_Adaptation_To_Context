For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lock-downs in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. It is crucial but hard to know how and when to take which level of interventions tailored to the specific situation in each country. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly accessing the effect of multiple interventions to control the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts in the UK and other European countries, accounting for balance of healthcare demand.",

Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild, moderate and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with date on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London and non-London regions in the UK during February 2020 and April 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. We applied the calibrated model to the prediction of infection and healthcare resource changes in other 6 European countries based on actual measures they have implemented during this period.",

But in the Europe, Italy, Spain and France have experienced a 3 weeks period of shortage of hospital beds for severe and critical cases, leading to many deaths outside hospitals. 3) One optimal strategy to control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK is to take region-level specific intervention. If taking suppression with very high intensity in London from 23 rd March 2020 for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in non-London regions. The total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 9.3 million and 143 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 96 th day (12 th May, 2020), where it needs hospital beds for 68.9 thousand severe and critical cases. 4) If taking a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 10 million and 154 thousand; the peak time of healthcare occurs at the 97 th day (13 th May, 2020), where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 73.5 thousand. 5) If too early releasing intervention intensity above moderate level and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, there would be a risk of second wave, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 23.4 million and 897 thousand.",

Our finding suggests that rolling intervention is an optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK and potential other countries for balancing healthcare demand and morality ratio. As for huge difference of population density and social distancing between different regions in the UK, it is more appropriate to implement regional level specific intervention with varied intensities and maintenance periods. We suggest an intervention strategy to the UK that take a consistent suppression in London for 100 days and 3 weeks rolling intervention in other regions. This strategy would reduce the overall infections and deaths of COVID-19 outbreaks, and balance healthcare demand in the UK.",

Compared to suppression, mitigation taken in the UK gave a slower decline in R in March, from 2.73[0.97-5.40] on the 24th day (1st March 2020) to 0.98[95% CI 0.88-1.09] on the 110th day (27th May 2020). It implied that during this period, there were still much growth of infections in the UK. But London had lower R than non-London regions.",

In Italy, our results suggested that, cumulatively, 0.8 [0.684-0.920] million people have been infected as of March 28 th , giving an attack rate of 9.8% [3.2%-25%] of the population. From 8 th February 2020, the total number of infections is about 1.9 million, the total number of deaths is about 41 thousand, the true mortality rate is 2.17%, and the ratio of hospital bed availability for COVID patients is 15%, where it refers to 85% hospital bed occupancy. Spain has seen a similar trend in the number of deaths, and given its smaller population, our model estimates that a higher proportion of the population, 1.15% (0.53 [0.46-0.59] million people) have been infected to date. From 1 st February 2020, the total number of infections is 2 million, the number of deaths is 41 thousand, and the true mortality rate is 2.07%. Germany is estimated to have one of the lowest attack rates at 0.51% with 423,193 [348,711-503,599] people infected. From 11 th February, the total number of infections is about 0.77 million, and the number of deaths is about 11 thousand. The true mortality rate is 1.5%, and the ratio of hospital bed availability for COVID patients is 20%. In France from 15 th February 2020, the total number of infections is about 972,351, and the number of deaths is about 30,532. The true mortality rate is 3.14%, and the ratio of hospital bed availability for COVID patients is 10%. In Belgium from 15 th February 2020, the total number of infections is about 991,412 and the number of deaths is about 19,209. The true mortality rate is 1.93%, and the ratio of hospital bed availability for COVID patients is 20%. In Switzerland 19 th from February 2020, the total number of infections is 104,109 people, the number of deaths is about 2331 people, the real mortality rate is 2.2%, and the ratio of hospital bed availability for COVID patients is 25%. We estimate that there have been many more infections than are currently reported. The high level of under-ascertainment of infections that we estimate here is likely due to the focus on testing in hospital settings rather than in the community. Despite this, only a small minority of individuals in each country have been infected, with an attack rate on average of 0.92% [0.51%-1.33%] with considerable variation between countries. Our estimates implied that the populations in Europe are not close to herd immunity (~50-75% if R is 2-4).",

Our results, which are driven largely by countries with advanced epidemics and larger numbers of deaths (e.g. Italy, Spain), suggest that these interventions have together had a substantial impact on transmission, as measured by changes in the estimated reproduction number R. Across all countries we find current estimates of R to range from a posterior mean of 0.97 [0.75-1.21] for Italy to a posterior mean of 0.95 [0.72-1.20] for Sweden, with an average of 0.96 across the 6 country posterior means, a 67% reduction compared to the pre-intervention values. Further, with R values dropping substantially, the rate of acquisition of herd immunity will slow down rapidly. This implies that the virus will be able to spread rapidly should interventions be lifted. While the growth in daily deaths has decreased, due to the lag between infections and deaths, continued rises in daily deaths are to be expected for some time. The results suggest that interventions will have a large impact on infections and deaths despite counts of both rising.",

The charts of Germany and Switzerland showed that there were no shortage of healthcare resources leading to non-hospital critical cases in both countries.

Considering difference and diversity of industrial structure of the regions with large population density and small population density in Europe, hybrid intervention was more suitable and effective to control outbreaks. For example, such strategy could complete London outbreak with suppression in 3 months and tolerate a longer recovery period of non-London regions taking 3 weeks rolling intervention.

First, our model's prediction depends on an estimation of intervention intensity that is presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. We assumed that each intervention had equivalent or similar effect on the reproduction number in different regions over time. The practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or other issues of certain county. In the UK or similar countries, how to quantify intervention intensity needs an accurate measure of combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. As for implementing rolling interventions in Europe, the policy needs to be very specific and wellestimated at each day according to the number of confirmed cases, deaths, morality ratio, health resources, etc. Secondly, our model used a variety of plausible biological parameters for COVID-19 based on current evidence as shown in Table. 1, but these assumed values might be varied by populations or countries. For instance, we assumed that average period of mild cases to critical cases is 7 days, and average period of elderly people in hospital from severe cases to deaths was 14 days, etc. The change of these variables may impact on our estimation of infections and deaths in the UK. Lastly, our model assumes a condition that there will be a reasonable growth of available hospital source as time goes in the UK after 23 rd March 2020. This was actually supported by latest news that Nightingale hospital that enables holding 4000 patients opened at London Excel centre on 4 th April 2020. 24 This assumption is also applicable to several other European countries.

We assumed that transmission ratio \u03b2 equals to the product of intervention intensity Mt and the probability of transmission (b) when exposed (i.e., hospital In Wuhan, intervention intensity was assumed within [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , and gave with a relatively accurate estimation of COVID-19 breakouts. 13 We calibrated its value with respect to the population density and human mobility in London and the UK, and estimated outcomes of COVID-2019 outbreaks by implementing different interventions.",
