Besides knowledge about the patients' immune status, the local resistance pattern, such as the frequencies of extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and methillicin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is important when deciding on empirical antimicrobial therapies.

Neutropenic fever is usually defined as a single temperature measurement of \u226538.3 \u00b0C (101 \u00b0F) or a temperature of \u226538.0 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F) sustained over a 1-h period in a patient with ANC <500 cells/\u03bcL. 2. It is very common in patients with hematologic malignancies and occurs in more than 80% of patients with chemotherapy-associated neutropenia. 3 . In approximately 50% of episodes, no diagnosis can be established (i.e., fever of unknown origin, FUO), whereas clinically documented infections and microbiological documented infections are diagnosed in around 25% of episodes each. 4. Bloodstream infections constitute the vast majority of microbiological documented infections. The epidemiology of bloodstream infections differs between centers, but generally there is a slight dominance of Gram-negative enteric bacteria (such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa) over Grampositive pathogens (such as coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans streptococci, E. faecium). Antimicrobial resistance is rapidly increasing among both Gram-negative and Gram-positive isolates, most importantly extended ESBL production in Enterobacteriaceae. 5. The all-over mortality is low, around 5%, due to low mortality in patients with FUO. In patients with documented infections, the reported mortality rates are considerably higher: around 20% in patients with lung infiltrates, 35% in severe sepsis, and 50% in patients with septic shock [1] . B. Diagnostics: 1. A careful clinical examination should be performed daily to identify possible infection focuses and detect clinical deterioration. Focuses that are easily overlooked include dental infections and perianal infections. 2. Blood cultures should be taken through the central catheter and peripherally simultaneously, making it possible to identify catheter-related bloodstream infections (see section \"CRBSI\").

Empirical and preemptive antifungal therapy: 1. Epidemiology: (a) Prolonged neutropenic fever despite broadspectrum antibiotic therapy is common, and empirical antifungal therapy based on this indication only will lead to administration of antifungals to around one third of neutropenic patients. However, the majority of these patients do not have an invasive fungal disease (IFD), and indiscriminate empirical antifungal therapy will thus expose patients to unnecessary and potentially harmful drugs. (b) The incidence of IFD is approximately 5-10% in high-risk patients receiving candida-active prophylaxis, such as AML/MDS patients receiving remission-intended chemotherapy. In patients receiving mold-active prophylaxis, usually posaconazole or voriconazole, the reported frequency of breakthrough IFD is considerably lower, between 0.5% and 1.5% [10] . 1. In the empirical approach, antifungal treatment is initiated after 72-96 h of neutropenic fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, even if there are no other signs or findings suggestive of IFD. As discussed above this approach will expose many patients to unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment and is not recommended. 2. In the preemptive approach, patients are screened in blood/plasma two to three times per week with one or more biomarkers, most often GM. If a biomarker becomes positive, a thoracic CT scan is performed, and if infil-trates are present, BAL are performed, and empirical antifungal therapy started. In patients with negative CT scans, screening with biomarkers continues, and no antifungals are started. If a biomarker becomes positive again, the procedure with a thoracic CT scan is repeated. Studies have shown that this approach significantly reduces the use of antifungals without reducing overall survival, although the frequency of diagnosed IFD was slightly higher than in the empirical arm [13] . 3. In the diagnostic approach, biomarkers and thoracic CT scans are performed in high-risk patients with neutropenic fever for more than 3-5 days despite broad-spectrum antibiotics.

GM constitutes part of the Aspergillus fungal wall and can be detected in serum and BAL (and in CSF) with a commercial test that is FDA approved.

CRBSI is a well-recognized complication in hematologic patients with a reported incidence of up till5.2 per 1000 catheter days. The causative organisms are most often coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Candida species, and, more seldom, Gram-negative enteric bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 3. Appropriate preventive measures are important to minimize CRBSI and include both education of the healthcare personnel handling the central venous catheter (CVC) and application of aseptic bundles during the insertion and use of the CVC. In addition, assessment of the necessity of the CVC should be made routinely with prompt removal when not needed [8]. B. Diagnostics: 1. Most often, the only clinical sign is fever, sometimes accompanied by signs of local infection at the insertion site or tunnel. 2. Blood cultures are simultaneously drawn peripherally and from the central catheter, preferably one set of blood cultures per lumen. 3. If the differential in time to positivity (DTP) is 2 h or more in favor of blood cultures drawn through the CVC, CRBSI definitions are fulfilled [7]. 4. A diagnose of catheter-related infection can also be made without positive blood culture if there are undisputable signs of infection (erythema, swollenness, pain) over the catheter tunnel or port pocket. 5. In the case of positive central blood cultures with an organism known to cause CRBSI, negative peripheral blood cultures, and no local signs of infection, a catheterrelated infection is suspected but not proven. A diagnostic algorithm in this scenario is outlined in Fig. 38.2. C. Treatment: [7, 8] 1. Catheter removal, together with targeted antimicrobial therapy, remains the mainstay of treatment of CRBSI. Removal should always be performed in septic, hypotensive patients, in patients with complicated CRBSI such as tunnel and port infections, and in CRBSI caused by Candida species. 2. Vancomycin should be added in septic, hypotensive patients with suspected CRBSI and/or local signs of infection such as tunnel infection, port abscesses, or cellulitis around insertion site.3. In CBRSI caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa andStaphylococcus aureus, removal of catheter is associated with lower relapse rates and better outcomes and should be performed routinely.4. In CBRSI caused by other Gram negatives thanPseudomonas, antibiotic-lock therapy can be tried if removal of the catheter is not feasible. 5. In CRBS with coagulase-negative staphylococci and no local signs of infection, the catheter can often be retained with the use of antibiotic-lock therapy. 6. Antibiotic-lock therapy involves installing a high concentration of an antibiotic to which the causative microbe is susceptible in the catheter lumen. The solution should be left in the lumen without interruption for at least 8 h per 24 h, but longer if possible. When using a catheter retaining strategy, 14 days of combined systemic therapy and antibiotic-lock therapy are usually recommended. When blood cultures become negative, iv therapy may be switched to oral. 7. If the catheter is removed and there are no signs of local or metastatic infection, treatment duration is usually 7 days, except for Staphylococcus aureus(14 days)  and Candida species (14 days after first negative blood culture).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF9": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF10": {"text": "GVHD graft-versus-host disease, AmB amphotericin B Steroid dependent or refractory or grade III-IV", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF12": {"text": "GI disease gastrointestinal disease, CMV cytomegalovirus, HHV-6 human herpes virus 6, EBV Epstein-Barr virus, HSV herpes simplex virus, RSV respiratory syncytial virus, VZV varicella zoster virus, HBV hepatitis B virus, HCV hepatitis C virus, JCV JC virus, HAV hepatitis A virus, HEV hepatitis E virus The rates of seropositivity in the population increase with age. HSV-1 usually causes localized infections in the orofacial area but can occur in other locations. HSV-2 usually causes localized infections in the urogenital tract. HSV-1 encephalitis is the most severe manifestation but is rare in hematology patients as in the normal population. HSV-2 can cause meningitis. (b) NAT is the diagnostic method of choice for both viruses. (c) Prophylaxis against HSV-1 and HSV-2 with acyclovir/valaciclovir is recommended to all seropositive patients undergoing HSCT and should be considered for other intensively treated hematology patients. These drugs are also first choice for treatment [29]. (d) Resistance to acyclovir can develop and occurs in approximately 5-15% of patients depending on risk profile. Foscarnet is the first-line treatment for acyclovir-resistant virus. D. Cytomegalovirus (CMV): (e) The rate of CMV seropositivity increases with age and varies with geographical location. CMV seropositivity is a risk factor for non-relapse mortality and decreased survival after allogeneic HCT. A CMV-seronegative donor should, if available, be used for a CMV-seronegative patient [30-32]. (f) Approximately 60% of CMV-seropositive patients develop active CMV infection after HSCT, most commonly during the first 2 months, while the risk for a CMV-seronegative patient receiving a graft from a CMV-seropositive donor is approximately 30%. For other hematology patients and patients undergoing autologous HSCT, the risks are much lower. Patients receiving anti-T-cell therapy are at an increased risk. (g) Most CMV infections are asymptomatic or cause low-grade fever possibly with depressed bone marrow function. End-organ CMV disease occurs in 2-10% of HSCT patients, most commonly gastrointestinal disease. CMV pneumonia is still associated with a high mortality. Other end-organ manifestations are retinitis, hepatitis, and encephalitis. Risk factors are allogeneic HCT, acute GVHD, and intensive T-cell suppression. CMV end-organ disease in other groups of hematology patients is uncommon [30]. (h) Weekly blood monitoring of allogeneic HCT patients is recommended using either quantitative PCR or the pp65 antigenemia assay. No fixed cutoff can be recommended since it depends on the risk profile of the patient and the exact assay used, but many centers use cutoffs around 1000 IU/ml [33]. (i) Monitoring is not routinely recommended for autologous HCT patients or other hematology patients. There is no information regarding cutoffs for therapy in these types of patients. (j) The diagnosis of CMV disease requires symptoms and/or signs + CMV detected from the involved organ. CMV in blood combined with symptoms from an organ is not enough for making the diagnosis CMV disease [30, 34]. (k) Possible strategies for management are prophylaxis, preemptive therapy, and treatment of end-organ disease. (l) Letermovir has been shown to be effective as prophylaxis reducing the risk for clinically significant CMV infection and can also reduce all-cause mortality [35]. (m) Preemptive therapy based on detection of CMV by monitoring is an effective strategy in high-risk patients such as allogeneic HCT recipients. Ganciclovir and valganciclovir are first-line drugs for treatment of CMV infection and disease. Highdose iv immunoglobulin (Ig) has been used in combination with ganciclovir or treatment of CMV pneumonia, but its usefulness has not been proven in studies [33]. (n) Antiviral resistance develops in 0-10% of patients depending on their risk profile. Secondline drugs are foscarnet and cidofovir. The main limitation with these drugs is side effects. Case reports and small case series exist with the use of leflunomide or artesunate for resistant and refractory CMV. (o) CMV specific T-cells are an option if available. (p) New antivirals are currently undergoing clinical development (maribavir, letermovir, brincidofovir). E. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV): (a) VZV causes to different diseases: primary VZV infection causes chickenpox and reactivation of VZV causes herpes zoster (HZ, shingles). (b) In countries not using general vaccination of children, most individuals have experienced chickenpox in childhood. (c) Chickenpox can become severe in immunocompromised individuals. (d) The risk for HZ increases with age and is also increased in immunocompromised individuals. (e) Most HZ cases are self-limiting and give local symptoms. However, disseminated infections mimicking primary varicella and visceral cases sometimes without skin rash occur with poor outcome unless rapidly diagnosed and treated. (f) Most cases can be easily recognized by the characteristic rash. PCR from the vesicular rash is the diagnostic method of choice, but immunofluorescence might also be used. PCR on blood is useful in the diagnosis of visceral cases. (g) Acyclovir and valaciclovir (valacyclovir) are the drugs of choice for prevention and treatment of VZV infections. Prophylaxis is recommended in patients at high risk for HZ such as HSCT recipients and myeloma patients treated with proteasome inhibitors. IV acyclovir should be given to patients with primary varicella and to disseminated and visceral HZ cases [36]. (h) Management of severe local HZ such as zoster ophthalmicus and zoster oticus needs close collaboration with appropriate specialists. F. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV): (a) The rate of seropositivity increases with age and most adults are seropositive. EBV constantly replicates in seropositive individuals without causing symptoms. (b) End-organ EBV disease including meningitis, hepatitis, and pneumonia occurs but is rare also in severe immunocompromised individuals. (c) The most important complication to EBV is posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) occurring in high-risk allogeneic HCT recipients. (d) EBV can also be a trigger of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in patients with hematologic malignancies. (e) In high-risk allogeneic HCT patients, monitoring in blood with quantitative PCR is indicated. There is no established cutoff since there is no standardized test [37]. (f) Symptoms and signs of PTLD are unspecific. Increased LDH, lymphadenopathy, and fever are common. CT scan for detection of splenomegaly and/ or intrathoracic or intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy should be considered. Biopsy of lymph nodes is needed to prove the diagnosis. (g) There is no specific antiviral therapy effective against EBV. (h) Rituximab is the preferred intervention both for preemptive therapy against EBV PTLD based on increasing EBV viral load and for treatment of established PTLD [37]. (i) Reduction of immunosuppression should be attempted if possible [37]. (j) EBV-specific T-cells are an option if available. G. Other herpesviruses Human herpesviruses (HHV)-6 A and B are the most common cause of viral encephalitis after allogeneic HCT. Their importance in other hematology patients is less well defined. The diagnosis is made by MRI + PCR on cerebrospinal fluid. Available antiviral drugs for treatment are foscarnet and ganciclovir/valganciclovir [38]. H. Community-acquired respiratory viruses: (a) Respiratory viruses circulate in the community, and the risk for patients with hematological diseases to become infected reflects the local epidemiology. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, and adenoviruses are best known to be able to cause disease in hematology patients, but reports of severe disease have been also reported with many other respiratory viruses including parainfluenza viruses, metapneumoviruses, and rhinoviruses. Nosocomial spread occurs which is why infection control is paramount. Most infections are mild and self-limiting, but severe infections can occur especially in allogeneic HCT recipients and patients receiving intensive immunosuppressive therapy [39-42]. (b) The diagnosis is in most centers based on multiplex PCR on respiratory samples either from the upper airways (nasal, nasopharyngeal, or throat samples) or from the lower respiratory tract (BAL fluid). Most existing assays can detect 10-15 different respiratory viruses. Other techniques can be used such as antigen tests and immunofluorescence but have limitations most important that they detect only one virus. (c) The most important part of management is prevention including avoiding infected individuals, handwashing, and influenza vaccination of patients, family members, and staff. It should be recognized that these infections can be spread by individuals having very limited symptoms. (d) If an allogeneic HCT candidate presents before start of conditioning with symptomatic infection with a respiratory virus, postponing the transplant should be considered. (e) Antiviral therapy has a limited role in most of these patients but can be considered in the most severely immunocompromised patients such as allogeneic HCT patients. (f) Therapeutic options with data supporting efficacy, although there are no controlled studies, are ribavirin for RSV, neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza, and cidofovir/brincidofovir for adenovirus infections.
