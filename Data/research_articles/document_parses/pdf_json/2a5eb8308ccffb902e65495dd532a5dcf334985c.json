For that purpose, an online questionnaire, based on 44 items including socio-demographic data, Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) Adherence Screener (MEDAS) as a reference of a healthy diet, processed foods intake, changes in their usual food choices and weight gain was distributed using social media and snowball sampling. A total of 7514 participants (37% aged below 35 years, 70.6% female, 77.9% university-level education or higher) from all the Spanish territory completed the questionnaire. Results outlined healthier dietary behaviours during the confinement when compared to previous habits. Overall, the MEDAS score (ranging from 0 to 14, whereby higher a scoring reflects greater adherence to the MedDiet) increased significantly from 6.53 \u00b1 2 to 7.34 \u00b1 1.93 during the confinement. Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender, region and other variables, showed a statistically significant higher likelihood of changing the adherence to the MedDiet (towards an increase in adherence) in those persons who decreased the intake of fried foods, snacks, fast foods, red meat, pastries or sweet beverages, but increased MedDiet-related foods such as olive oil, vegetables, fruits or legumes during the confinement. COVID-19 confinement in Spain has led to the adoption of healthier dietary habits/behaviours in the studied population, as reflected by a higher adherence to the MedDiet.

The adherence to the MedDiet in the group of age from 51 years and older was slightly but significantly increased during the confinement in our study. Interestingly, the highest change was found in the youngest survey respondents who also significantly increased the adherence to the MedDiet during the confinement. The mean MEDAS score raised by 0.92 points up to 6.86 \u00b1 2.14. When we looked at the MedDiet related-foods contributing most to the change in the MedDiet adherence during the COVID-19 confinement, a lower intake of pastries, red meat and sweetened/carbonated beverages followed by a higher intake of vegetables, fruits and olive oil were the most important contributors to this association. The lower consumption of meat could be related with the lack of stock in the Spanish supermarkets and grocery stores after the state of alarm was declared. In fact, nearly 28% of participants who had any difficulty finding any food in their usual supermarket highlighted meat as the main one. COVID-19 related changes in consumer behaviours have been noticed in Spain. As an example, online grocery sales have skyrocketed by 25% during the last weeks after the state of alarm was declared, according to data from the European Foundation for Innovation (INTEC). In the same report, the demand for confectionery products and butter also increased in more than 50% [28] . This is in agreement with the latest data from the Google Trends tool which shows how the Spanish population has considerably increased their search about the term \"homemade cake\" coinciding with the first week of confinement in March (when the 'State of Alarm' began) and compared to the last five years ( Figure S2a ). However, it does not explain that most people in our study decreased the intake of pastries (both, commercial and homemade pastries) during the confinement. It could be assumed that during the confinement people could have more time for cooking. In spite of according to Google Trends the term \"traditional recipes\" also increased exponentially ( Figure S2b ), data about the influence of cooking in the increase of adherence to the MedDiet during the confinement were somehow contradictory. Particularly, participants who increased or decreased cooking during the confinement, were more likely to change their adherence to the MedDiet (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.67-2.01 and OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.57-2.58) compared to those who kept cooking as before the confinement starts. For those who cooked less during that period, the explanation of a higher association with the adherence to the MedDiet could reside in the choice of fresh foods typical from the MedDiet which can be eaten raw such as vegetables and preserved and cooked legumes. For those participants who cooked more during the confinement than they used to do, it can be assumed that they were adopting healthier cooking habits than they had before the confinement.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 355, "end": 359, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1734, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2044, "end": 2054, "text": "Figure S2a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2405, "end": 2415, "text": "Figure S2b", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The intake of wine was not associated with a higher adherence to the MedDiet before or during the confinement.

It was useful to achieve a relatively large number of participants which had been impossible to obtain employing face-to-face interviews due to the COVID-19 confinement.

Among them, the oversampling of a particular network due to the non-random snowball sampling method could be highlighted. For example, respondents were predominantly from Andalusia and 70.6% of participants were women. The same selection bias could be found with the level of education and income. However, with this respect, Ekman et al. [39] affirmed that the bias associated with collecting information using online questionnaires was not greater than that caused by paper questionnaires. The low representation of people with primary studies in the COVIDiet study (8.2%) in relation with the whole population could be due to the fact that this population is less likely to use smart technologies could have been an obstacle to participate in the survey. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that, despite the current research could not be representative of all the Spanish adult population, coverage of all age groups, Spanish territories and educational levels has been achieved. Since non-personal data were included in the questionnaire, no questions regarding job titles/categorizations were included. For that reason, it cannot be excluded that some of the survey respondents (e.g., pharmacists, health care providers, people who work in supermarkets or grocery stores, drivers, shippers, etc.) were not completely locked down. However, it should be mentioned that those persons had to eat at home due to the impossibility to have lunch outside because all restaurants were closed. Since the participants were untrained, the perception that they could had about the food portions could underestimate/overestimate their real intake. Additionally, since we performed a web-based study, in which a questionnaire was self-administered and online, participants did not have the opportunity to ask about any doubts that could be presented. However, the MEDAS is a validated and widely used instrument for rapid estimation to the MedDiet adherence [17] which allows further comparisons to other research studies. The participation of non-healthy persons who require to follow a special diet cannot be discarded; this information was, however, not collected.
