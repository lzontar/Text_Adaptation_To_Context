As a result of the overlap of emergence of the infection and surge of travel during the national holiday season, the COVID-19 disease began to spread quickly across China . Recognizing the problem, the Chinese government quickly took extreme measures to contain the spread of the virus, actions that included quarantining the entire city of Wuhan.

We also compared radiographic and laboratory findings of 788 COVID-19 patients with and without exposure to Wuhan, where only the differences in AST and LDH were statistically significant between the two groups. The differences in AST and LDH may be due to age differences between the groups since patients in the control group were older than those in the exposure group.
