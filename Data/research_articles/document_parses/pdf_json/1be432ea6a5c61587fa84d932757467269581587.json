We have proposed a new model predicting z the logarithm of the number of detected-contaminated people. It follows a linear dynamical system\u017c = b\u2212az. We show here that we can improve this prediction using a non linear model\u017c = b \u2212 az r where r is an exponent that we have also to estimate from data. Some countries have an epidemic with a bell shaped form that we call unimodal epidemic. With this new model, we fit observed data of different countries having an unimodal epidemic with a surprising quality. We discuss also the prediction quality obtained with these models at the epidemic start in France. Finally, we evaluate the containment impact on the Covid French mortality in hospitals.",

This model [4] is a renewal stochastic model using the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) with a time-varying reproduction number that predicts the average number of secondary infections at a given time. In [2] we have shown that time-invariant SIR models were not effective to forecast the number of contaminateddetected people and we have proposed a new model. It was a dynamical linear model forecasting the logarithm of the cumulated infected-detected population z. The dynamics was\u017c = b \u2212 az. In this paper, we show that this model can be improved using the dynamics\u017c = b \u2212 az r where r is a real number to be estimated from observed data.",

We will call these models 1-C, 1 for unimodal, and C for contaminated which correspond to the sum of I infected and R recovered of the SIR models. In [2] we have given an explicit formula for this form that is KE p,a where E p,a = ae \u2212a(t\u2212p) e \u2212e \u2212a(t\u2212p) is a probability density without moments but with a peak at p and a controlling the width of the bell shape. Probably, the general form of an epidemic can be described as a linear finite or infinite mixture of such densities that we call epidemic probabilities. Here, we introduce this r number which controls the right probability queue of the bell shape. But we are not anymore able to give an explicit form of the corresponding probability density. Based on this model able to predict the infected people number, and the fatality rate observed in France, we can compute an estimator of Covid deaths in hospitals that would have happened without the containment policy and compare it with the prediction given by [5] . But, to improve the confidence in the obtained figures, we have to discuss about the robustness of the predictor at the epidemic start. Indeed, at the beginning the noise on data is large and a small error on the estimated parameters a, b and r can produce a large error on the size of contaminated people at the end of the epidemic.",

Now, let us discuss a little bit about the robustness of the predictors. For that, we consider the prediction, obtained in the French case, of the cumulated infected people at the end of the epidemic in different cases. These quantities can be easily obtained. Indeed all the models considered here have an asymptote when t goes to infinity. It is given by e (b/a) 1/r for the new proposed model and b/a for the SIR model. We obtain the following results:",

Moreover a small difference in r can produce a large difference on the asymptote e (b/a) 1/r . Therefore we have only to discuss the cases 1 and 3, the linear model with data filtered or not. Since we have few data it seems more reliable to choose the case 3.

Raoult has shown that with his treatment we can obtain a fatality rate of 0.005 for a population actively detected (that was the case for all the French population in phase 2). Therefore this prediction of 10 000 deaths without containment policy is probably over estimated by a factor 2 or 3 of what would have happened in absence of containment but with an active detection and an early treatment policy as the one proposed by Pr. Raoult. This abrupt conclusion must be moderated by two points : -firstly the screening tests were not available in France to apply Pr. Raoult's policy easily, -secondly the prediction done here is based on an unimodal model, but without containment policy there is a risk, probably avoidable by the Pr Raoult's policy, that this kind of unimodal model is not anymore valid (in the Sweden's case a plateau is appearing at the top of the bell shaped form of the daily detected people).",
