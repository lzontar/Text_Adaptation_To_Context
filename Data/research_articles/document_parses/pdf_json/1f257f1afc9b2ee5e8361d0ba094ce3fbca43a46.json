Thus, it is highly likely that e-procurement challenges are documented in papers published in these different domains. So far, there is a lack of an integrated approach to the synthesis of e-procurement implementation challenges; and when there is an attempt to do so, it is carried out in a rather fragmented manner. Researchers have seldom stepped outside a specific discipline in e-procurement literature reviews. For example, Patrucco [43] undertook a systematic literature review on public e-procurement, focusing only on papers published in the Journal of Public Procurement. While this provides an initial view of e-procurement, such studies fail to provide a holistic view of the phenomenon given that e-procurement spans works in e-government, information systems, and public administration. To address this shortcoming, this paper offers a systematic approach to synthesizing e-procurement implementation challenges by including publications from the three domains mentioned above.

Building upon this awareness, future studies can embark on explaining the causal mechanism of these challenges and how best to address them in a context-specific manner. This research work focused on e-procurement implementation challenges as a whole and excluded challenges pertaining to specific eprocurement processes such as e-tendering and e-reverse auction. The proposed framework in this paper can be used in future case studies to examine e-procurement implementation challenges under each focus area of the TOE [50] and their relationship.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1380, "end": 1384, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Environmental Challenges"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Organisational issues with electronic government procurement -a case study of the UAE", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Al-Moalla", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Li", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2010, "venue": "EJISDC", "volume": "41", "issn": "3", "pages": "1--18", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Adoption of E-procurement systems in developing countries: a Nigerian public sector perspective", "authors": [{"first": "V", "middle": ["O"], "last": "Adebayo", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Evans", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "2nd International Conference on Knowledge-Based Engineering and Innovation", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "356--376", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "E-public procurement: which factors determine its acceptance by small to medium-sized enterprises and large companies in Belgium?", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Alomar", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Visscher", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2017, "venue": "Int.

Based on Google Scholar, the earliest case studies on public e-procurement were published around the year 2001. Data collection was focused consistently around the aim of the research, and the keywords used were specific to the goal of the study, as shown in Fig. 1, which depicts the different systematic passes used in the search and selection of relevant articles: 1. The first pass: articles were searched and selected from top-rated journals in the streams of information systems, e-government, and public administration, e.g.: -Basket of eight leading Information Systems (IS) journals: European Journal of Information Systems, Information Systems Journal, Information Systems Research, Journal of Association of Information Systems, Journal of Management Information System, MIS Quarterly, Journal of Strategic Information Systems and Journal of Information Technology. -Given that in several developing countries including those in Africa, e-procurement implementation is an important issue, the top 3 IT4D journals, i.e., Electronic Journal of Information System in Developing Countries (EJISDC), IT for Development and IT for International Development were also searched. -IS conference proceedings focusing on emerging e-procurement implementation challenges that are found in research-in-progress in the respective aforementioned streams. The AIS top 4 conferences (ICIS, ECIS, PACIS, and AMCIS) were searched as well as IFIP conferences. -Leading top-rated e-government journals consulted were: International Journal of E-Government Research (IJEGR), Journal of E-Government, Journal of e-Governance, Government Information Quarterly -In public administration stream: the Journal of Public Administration and Public", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "Search and selection of articles (after the fashion of Gunther et al. 2017)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Screening of papersexclusion criteria", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Breakdown of selected articles by publication outlet Journals Read a Retained AIS basket of eight leading IS journals (MISQ, ISR, JMIS, JAIS, ISJ, JSIS, EJIS JIT); ICT4D Top 3 (EJISDC, IT4D and ITID)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "(continued)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Empirical findings of public e-procurement implementation challenges", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
