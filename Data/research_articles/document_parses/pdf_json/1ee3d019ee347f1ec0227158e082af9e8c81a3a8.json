To assess the spreading of di erent content type, we analyze consumption pa erns based on both interaction type and source reliability. Overall we nd that there are no strong statistical di erences in the social response to questionable and reliable content, both following a power law distribution. However, questionable and reliable sources display structural and topical di erences in the use of hashtags. e commenting behaviour of users in terms of both lifetime and sentiment reveals that questionable and reliable posts are perceived in the same manner. We can conclude that despite evident di erences between questionable and reliable posts Gab users do not perform such a di erentiation thus treating them as a whole. Our results provide insights toward the understanding of coordinated inauthentic behavior and on the early-warning of information operation.",

Within such niche media, biased information proliferates [15] and users, either interested in joining the community or banned by other social media, tend to develop the feeling of community belonging with like-minded individuals, i.e., an echo-chamber [19] .

However, low moderation and regulation of contents has resulted in a widespread of hate speech and fake news. For these reasons, it has been repeatedly suspended by its service provider, and its mobile app has been banned from both App and Play stores [45] . In particular, Gab a racted the interest of researchers due to its permissive content regulatory policy and the political leaning of its users. In [33] authors analyze the content shared on Gab and the leaning of users, nding a rather homogeneous environment prone to share right biased content. Authors of [45] characterize Gab in terms of users leaning and content shared, suggesting that it is more similar to a safe place for right wing extremist rather than a environment where free speech is protected. Moreover, a topological analysis performed by authors of [14] reveals that Gab users appear as one quite homogeneous cluster biased to the right. Further, di erently from other platforms such as Twi er and Facebook, in Gab there is a lack of users with leaning opposite to the most popular one. Overall, all these studies suggest that Gab can be considered as a homogeneous environment where biased content and misinformation may easily proliferate.",

A graph that respects the last formalized equality, called Handshaking Lemma, is an undirected graph. Another instance that we take into account is the bipartite graph, that is a graph in which the vertex set V is the union of two disjoint independent sets called the partitions of G. e equivalent of an adjacency matrix for a bipartite graph is a h \u00d7 p rectangular matrix called incidence matrix B that takes values 0 or 1, where the element B i j = 1 if nodes i and j are connected. A bipartite graph can be easily projected onto one of its partitions by performing an operation called one-mode projection that can be formalized in terms of the product P = B T B, in the case we are projecting onto the partition of size p, and P = BB T if we are projecting onto the partition of size h. P is a symmetric matrix whose elements P i j are nonnegative numbers that represent, in the case of o -diagonal elements, the number of common links of the nodes i and j to the partition of size h or p. e diagonal elements of the matrix P are also nonnegative numbers that represent the degree of the node in the bipartite graph. Since the elements on the diagonal of the matrix P have a di erent meaning with respect to the elements away from the diagonal, it is common practice to set the diagonal elements P ii = 0. e matrix P a er such a treatment, can be also called co-occurence matrix since two elements are interconnected if they are co-connected to at least one node of the partition they don't belong to. In addition, the number of co-connections between i and j is represented by the link weight, i.e., by the element P i j of the matrix P.",

MBFC has been frequently used for source classi cation [3, 8, 14] . It provides a classi cation determined by ranking bias in four di erent categories that are: Biased Wording/Headlines, Factual/Sourcing, Story Choices and Political A liation. A score is assigned to each category per each news outlet and the average score determined the bias of the outlet, as explained in the Methodology Section of the website. To each news outlet is associated a label that refers either to a political bias, namely, Right, Right-Center, Least-Biased, Le -Center and Le or to its reliability that is expressed in three labels namely, Conspiracy-Pseudoscience, Pro-Science or estionable. Noticeably, also the estionable set includes a wide range of political biases, from Extreme Le to Extreme Right. For instance, the Right label is associated to Fox News, the estionable label to Breitbart (the well-known extreme right outlet) and the Pro-Science label to Science. Using such a classi cation, we divide the news outlets into estionable outlets and Reliable outlets. All the outlets already classi ed as estionable or belonging to the category Conspiracy-Pseudoscience are labelled as estionable, the rest is labelled as Reliable.",

A er having estimated x min and \u03b1, we compute n 1 , i.e., the number of values below x min from the initial dataset, and n 2 , i.e the di erence with the total cardinality n and the n 1 previously calculated. Consequently, we perform 5000 randomized instances where, for each of them, we performed a Kolgomorov-Smirnov test between the uniform distribution U (1, x min ), containing n 1 values, and the power law distribution with parameter a, containing n 2 values. We end up with obtaining a p-value that ranges from 0.90 to 0.95 for the distribution of likes to questionable, and 0.986 to 0.992 for the reliable ones. us we can accept the hypothesis that data is generated by a power law distribution. e estimated exponent is 3.36 and 3.34 for questionable and reliable sources respectively, implying the presence of very large deviation in the number of likes for both categories. Panels 2c and 2d of Figure 2 show the temporal evolution of the cumulative and average number of likes to questionable and reliable contents. e matching between the two curves observed in the panel 2c is due to an increase in the number of reliable posts rather than to an increase in the users endorsement to such posts. Indeed, as con rmed by panel 2d of Figure 2 , questionable posts receive on average an higher number of likes. It is nonetheless interesting the in ation in the number of reliable posts happened at the beginning of February that could be related either to a growing concern about the global pandemic or to a growing debate around reliable news. Nonetheless, this in ation does not re ect in a correspondent growth in the number of likes, showing a constant interest of Gab users towards questionable sources.",
