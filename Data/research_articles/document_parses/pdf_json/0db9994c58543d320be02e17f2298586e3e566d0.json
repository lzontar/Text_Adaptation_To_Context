            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a life-threatening respiratory disease, was first reported in Southern China in November 2002, and it spread widely to other Asian countries, North America, and Europe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak, and 774 of the infected patients died. A novel coronavirus associated with cases of SARS (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of this endemic atypical pneumonia. [1] SARS-CoV is a single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus, and its genome structure comprises both replicase and structural regions. [2] The polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa), encoded by the viral replicase gene, are subject to extensive proteolytic processing by viral proteases to produce multiple functional subunits, which are responsible for the formation of the replicase complex. The SARS-CoV 3CL protease, named after the 3C protease of the Picornaviridae, is a~33 kDa cysteine protease that cleaves the replicase polyprotein at 11 conserved sites with canonical Leu-Glnfl(Ser, Ala, Gly) sequences [3] [4] [5] Because of the functional importance of SARS-CoV 3CL protease in the viral life cycle, together with successes in developing efficacious antiviral agents targeting 3C-like proteases in other viruses, [6] this enzyme has been recognized as a prime target for therapeutic intervention against SARS-CoV infection.",

We thus carried out computational modeling methods to explore all 20 20 dipeptides as model ligands for possible protein-ligand interactions. An exhaustive exploration of the dipeptide binding modes using automated computational modeling procedures revealed that the Trp-Trp dipeptide emerged as the strongest binder on the basis of the ranking system used. Moreover, 63 out the topranked 100 protein-ligand complexes contained at least one Trp residue (for details see the Supporting Information).

The preliminary results revealed that a conformational change, presumably induced by the presence of the ligand, was observable at the loop region near the active site (Figure 1 A) . Differential electron density maps in the presence of compound 4 indicated that the ligand was partially visible, but the molecular structure of the ligand could not be precisely defined.",

            "text": "However, computational structures of compound 4 with the 3CL protease were constructed by use of the preliminary X-ray protein structure obtained in the presence of compound 4. This structure was different from the 3CL protease structure used in the previous modeling task in that the previous structure was derived with chloromethyl ketone complexed with the protease. We expected that this round of computational modeling would produce a more realistic protein-ligand complex model. The predicted model ligand structure would then be superimposed onto the differential electron density maps to confirm the validity of the binding mode of the ligand on the target protein. As de- www.chembiochem.org scribed in the Supporting Information, the prediction of the model binding structure of compound 4 did not use any information from the differential electron density map; the purpose was to use the differential electron density map as an independent test to assess the validity of the predicted binding mode. Visual examination of the top-ranked protein-ligand complex structures generated from all three docking software packages revealed a consensus complex structure, suggesting a tight packing of the two tryptophan sidechains into the S1 and S2 binding pockets, with the two Cbz moieties occupying the neighboring S3 and S1' sites. The consensus was particularly strong with regard to the tryptophan sidechain conformation, for which precise hydrogen-binding configurations satisfy-ing hydrogen-bonding donors in the tryptophan side chains were conserved throughout the top-ranked structures, while the hydrophobic packing between the tryptophan side chains and the ligand-binding sites was tightly matched. The induced hydrogen-bonded local conformation involving side chain Asn142 fitted perfectly to accommodate the tryptophan sidechain as part of the S1 binding site in the model structure, while His41 formed another hydrogen-bonding pattern with another indole group at the S2 site (Figure 1 B) . The binding conformations of the Cbz moieties, however, were less certain from the consensus complex structures. The uncertainty in modeling Cbz moieties in the ligand-protein complex was the result of a lack of favorable interactions between the Cbz moieties and substrate binding site in the protein. This uncertainty was also manifested in the incomplete X-ray crystallographic data for the Cbz groups. The paucity of favorable Cbz-protein interactions in the complex model suggested the possibility for further improvement in the binding affinity and specificity through replacement of the Cbz moieties with other functional groups.",

The C 2 -symmetric diol 9 was then designed and synthesized, and showed higher affinity than the previous lead compound (TL-3), by one order of magnitude in its inhibition constant (0.6!0.073 mm). Compounds 4 and 9 represent the most potent noncovalent 3CL protease inhibitors with structural analyses reported to date. This was a successful example of lead optimization by computer modeling prediction, and both potency and selectivity (over HIV protease) were achieved. Though the electrondensity map of the complex has not been well defined, the preliminary X-ray structure can be used to support the computer modeling analysis of diol 4 in complexation with the 3CL protease, which indicated that both NHs of the indole rings formed hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asn142 and His41. We believe that this approach has provided a platform for further lead optimization.",
