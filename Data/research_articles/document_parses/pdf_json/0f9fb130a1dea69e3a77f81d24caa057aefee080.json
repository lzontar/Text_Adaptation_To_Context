While ASCO guidelines recommend that surveillance frequency be based on cardiovascular and treatment-related risk factors and clinical judgement, of 865 patients receiving high-risk cancer treatment regimens (84.5% anthracyclines) with rigorous monitoring showed a high cumulative incidence of CTRCD (37.5%). However, the majority were mild (31.6%); moderate (LVEF 40-49%) and severe CTRCD (LVEF <40% or symptomatic HF) occurred in only 2.8% and 3.1% of patients, respectively. Mortality was associated with the development of severe rather than mild or moderate CTRCD.(11) It may thus be reasonable to temporarily delay early, routine imagingduring anthracycline therapy unless there is a potential immediate impact on clinical decisions. Potential scenarios include: signs or symptoms of HF; anthracycline dosages \u2265400mg/m 2 with need for additional anthracyclines; patients with baseline CVD or high burden of CV risk factors who received anthracycline dosages \u2265250 mg/m 2 with continued need for anthracyclines. This may allow for less frequent testing during the pandemic while still imaging patients prior to the occurrence of CTRCD, allowing timely cardioprotective therapy.(6,7) The most common scenario mandating repeated cardiac surveillance during treatment is for patients receiving trastuzumab therapy. ESMO guidelines and the FDA package insert recommend surveillance imaging every 3 months during trastuzumab treatment. However, most routine cardiac surveillance tests during trastuzumab treatment may not result in changes in clinical care.(3) Hence, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in women without cardiovascular risk factors treated with non-anthracycline-regimens, it may be appropriate to only perform imaging at 6 and 12 months. In patients with risk factors for CTRCD such as prior anthracycline exposure, age \u226560 years, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, obesity with a prior normal LVEF, it may be reasonable to consider imaging at 3, 6 and 12 months into trastuzumab therapy similar to clinical trial protocols.(12) However, patients with a borderline (e.g. LVEF 50-55%), reduced LVEF on a prior study, pre-existing CVD, or any signs or symptoms of HF should continue to have imaging as per current clinical practice. While exact risk with additional cardiotoxic exposures such as radiation and pertuzumab therapy are not well defined, similar imaging protocol could be considered in these patients. If clinical concerns regarding the development of HF are raised during telemedicine visits or at the time of treatment, patients should receive timely imaging.(3) We reiterate the importance of cardiovascular risk factor modification, disease management, and monitoring of symptoms in these patients. Patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer receiving prolonged HER2-targeted are at increased risk for CTRCD.(13) The median time to CTRCD in this population is ~8-11 months.(13) It is reasonable to conduct testing less frequently in this group during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first year of therapy, it may reasonable to repeat imaging every 6 months in asymptomatic patients.
