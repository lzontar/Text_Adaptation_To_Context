Infectious diseases have had, and continue to have, a profound impact on military operations. As an example, during World War II, malaria infections affected at least 124,000 U.S. military personnel in the Pacific (Ho, Hwang, and Lee 2014) . More recently, HIV/AIDS reduced troop strength for countries across sub Saharan Africa (Feldbaum, Lee, and Patel 2006) In addition to these two large scale examples, regular outbreaks of malaria and other febrile illnesses, diarrheal diseases, and respiratory diseases have been known to limit for use under a CC0 license.

            "text": "Military personnel represent a unique population from a health security perspective. They are typically highly mobile, self-sustaining and often are able to deploy to austere settings, domestically and internationally, which may increase exposure to emerging pathogens. Recruits train in crowded conditions, increasing risk for pathogen transmission. Military personnel are also often immunologically naive to circulating pathogens (Institute of Medicine, 2002) , which puts them at elevated risk for infections and diseases, such as malaria (Manning et al 2014) . Not only are military personnel at risk for infections while deployed, these exposures can pose a risk for host nation populations due to transmission of infectious pathogens; similarly these pathogens may represent a risk for the military personnels' own countries upon redeployment back to their home of origin (Zemke 2019) . Examples abound where military personnel have been involved with disease transmission events during deployment internationally or during exercises within their national borders. Spread of pandemic influenza, both in 1918 and in 2009, was likely exacerbated by in-country and international travel of military personnel (Johns, Blazes et al. 2011) . Notably, cholera was introduced into Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, most likely by Nepalese peacekeepers (Frerichs, Keim et al. 2012 , Eppinger, Pearson et al. 2014 , Orata, Keim et al. 2014 ), leading to a large outbreak (hundreds of thousands of cases) of diarrheal disease among a highly susceptible host nation civilian population. Mobility can be a concern even within a country's boundaries. For example, an outbreak of malaria in the northern coast of Peru, in a region where no malaria had been reported for four years, was linked to Plasmodium falciparum strains potentially introduced by military personnel returning from operations in the Peruvian Amazon (Baldeviano, Okoth et al. 2015) .",

While the GHSA properly calls to link public health with law and multisectoral rapid response, including defense and other stakeholders within the security sector, there is insufficient incorporation of military involvement more broadly into Prevent and Detect core areas, which address priorities such as monitoring antimicrobial resistance, immunization programs, infectious disease surveillance, and public health workforce development. Further, comments and recommendations related to multisectoral engagement may be intended to include the military but are not clearly stated, which may limit the ability of the country to respond to JEE recommendations in a meaningful way.

As an example of such activities, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has been actively engaged with partner militaries on health security activities aimed at countering biological threats and improving surveillance data for force health protection (Morrison, Ayotte, and Gerberding 2019; Quinnan 2016). These collaborations enable partner militaries to enhance their own capabilities to mitigate threats (Chretien, Blazes, et al. 2007 ). In Africa, an example of such collaboration is the African Partner Outbreak Response Alliance, where partner militaries have increased coordination to improve national and regional responses to infectious diseases. In Southeast Asia, malaria has been called out as a particular opportunity and need for military-military coordination, since militaries operate in remaining endemic regions and could collaborate to support malaria elimination efforts in often remote settings (Manning, Satharath et al. 2014) .

For example, JEE scores are generally representative of other health outcomes and align with measures associated with public health system capabilities (Samhouri, Ijaz et al. 2018; Gupta, Kraemer et al. 2018) , and JEEs corresponded with response capabilities during an outbreak (Garfield, Bartee et al. 2019) .
