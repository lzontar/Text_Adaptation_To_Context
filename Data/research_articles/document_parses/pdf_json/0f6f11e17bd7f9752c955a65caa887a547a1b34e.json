There are no generally recognized effective treatments for COVID- 19 , but treatments are urgently needed. Anti-viral medications and vaccines are in the early developmental stages and may take many months or even years to fully develop. At present, management of COVID-19 with respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments, but unfortunately such treatments are associated with high mortality rates. Therefore, it is imperative to consider novel new therapeutic interventions to treat/ameliorate respiratory conditions associated with COVID- 19 . Alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinically available treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions, or erthropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy were hypothesized to increase oxygenation of tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator treatments. It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms. In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried Introduction A novel virus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a syndrome of symptoms that are classified as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1] . was first described among a case-series of patients that visited a local market in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 and the virus was first isolated on 7 January 2020 [2] . Since then, COVID-19 has spread around the world with the most recent estimates, as of 10 April 2020 revealing that there are currently 1,631,310 confirmed cases and 98,400 deaths [3].",

Further, pRBC transfusions are a common medical procedure, especially among patients receiving critical care [26] .

In addition, a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials revealed that HCQ treatment among patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus significantly reduced their levels of hemoglobin A1c (glycated hemoglobin decreases the oxygen carrying capacity and limits oxygen tissue delivery) [37] .

A significant percentage of the mortality associated with COVID-19 is related to respiratory conditions. At present, respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments for respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19. Unfortunately, despite such treatments of COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions, a high mortality rate is still being observed. It is hypothesized that there are underlying pathological changes among COVID-19 patients that are compatible with ARDS. A series of alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinical available treatments such as HBOT, pRBC transfusions, or ESAs were hypothesized to deliver increased oxygen to peripheral tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator support therapeutic treatments. Figure 2 provides an overview of the mechanism of action for the various novel treatment strategies for respiratory conditions in COVID-19 patients. It is recommend, given such alternative therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among 11 COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions. It is also recommend that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions. It is hypothesized that hyperbaric oxygen therapy will significantly increase O 2 levels in the blood independently of Hb levels and improve tissue oxygenation. It is also hypothesized that packed red blood cell transfusions or injected erthropoiesis-stimulating agents will significantly raise blood Hb levels by increased numbers of red blood cells and improve tissue oxygenation.",

The fraction of HbO 2 relative to total Hb in arterial blood is the SaO 2 , which is normally > 95%. Normal mixed SvO 2 is about 65-75%.
