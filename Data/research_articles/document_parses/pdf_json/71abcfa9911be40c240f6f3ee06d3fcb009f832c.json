Results were expressed as percentages of total responses excluding blank or unattended response. Overall theme-specific responses were described as a spectrum of findings, and related inferences were drawn. Results Among approached practitioners, 90 responded to the survey, more than 80% were practicing consultants, and more than 50% from academic institutions. The results of the study showed that the ongoing pandemic had severely affected gynecological oncology practice and care amongst all respondents. There were modifications in diagnostic pathways, interventions, and follow-ups across all organ sites. There was a near-unanimous opinion on the use of general safety measures to combat the virus and to use complete PPEs in a high-risk situation. There were mixed responses to alternative educational activities, especially using electronic technology and distant learning methods. There was optimism among respondents with regards to the current situation normalizing in 3-6 months. Conclusion This study documents the pandemic affected scenario of gynecological cancer care and perceptions of Gynecological Oncologists in India. A significant effect on all aspects of cancer care was observed. Technological learning methods, both for patient care and educational activities, were being adopted by many respondents.",

On 30 January 2020, following the recommendations of the Emergency Committee, the WHO Director-General declared that the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) or pandemic [4] . There has been an unexpected and exponential rise in the number of cases all over the globe, with over 1.8 million cases worldwide and more than 0.11 million fatalities [5] . The impact of COVID-19 is substantial and has already caused significant economic, social, and health-care disruptions worldwide [6] [7] [8] . India's first COVID-19 case was found on 30 January 2020.

Questions with ambiguous intent or options were refined. The survey was disbursed through www.surveymonkey.com to personal mail addresses of members of The Association of Gynecological Oncologists of India (AGOI) and WhatsApp groups. There was a set of closed and open-ended questions whose answers could be marked on a numerical scale.

With regards to early endometrial cancer, surgery is the mainstay of treatment and preferably Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) [23], but only one in two underwent surgery. Some form of therapy was advocated (hormonal/NACT) so that surgery could be delayed [24] . There are concerns with the safety of MIS regarding smoke evacuation and intra-abdominal pressure, which might have altered the clinician's decision to delay MIS [25] . Many early vulvar cancers were managed by observation, and only a few received surgery or neoadjuvant therapy. Vulvar cancers constitute less than 10% of the surgical workload, so interpretation is difficult as numbers treated during this time might be few. On speculation, the elderly age group delayed healing of the surgical wound, and prolonged hospitalization might have shifted the balance towards observation with intent to delay surgery compared to the cervix or endometrium [26] .",

There is an increased risk of acquiring viral infection as RT requires multiple hospital visits, chemotherapy suppresses immunity, and increases susceptibility to infection [13, 14] . There might have been obvious logistic reasons for following one treatment over the other such as lack of availability of slots to treat, inability to travel to a center with RT or surgical facility, or reduced number of medical/nursing staff working due to quarantine and lockdown issues. The overall oncological outcomes of early gynecological cancers are excellent; hence they need to be evaluated and compared to pre-COVID literature as there are deviations from standard management now globally. It would remain to be seen how many patients developed COVID-19 due to cancer-related treatment and contributed to overall morbidity and mortality.",

A common sense, rationed approach to the availability of resources like PPEs and the magnitude of this pandemic is being followed cautiously not only in India but all over the world [33, 34] . There was a mixed response to HCQ prophylaxis as the evidence and availability are an issue [35, 36] . It has been recommended both by CDC and ICMR, after showing promise in several studies in vivo [37, 38] . But there have been certain concerns raised about potential cardiac side effects, especially in combination with azithromycin or individual with underlying cardiac conditions. Responders have shown similar concerns. Studies on HCQ prophylaxis are still evolving, and there is no consensus worldwide on HCQ prophylaxis for health care workers. . The ongoing pandemic has forced a delay in cancer management due to several reasons cited above. This is likely to have an adverse effect on overall cancer care. We may soon be facing a bi-modal peak of cancer deaths; the imminent spike of those with decimated immunity falling victim to Covid-19 and the latent toll on those whose treatments were de-intensified, delayed or canceled altogether. To survive SARS-CoV-2 only to then succumb to an undertreated cancer would be a Pyrrhic victory. The acuteness of infection and the chronicity of malignancy are the Scylla and Charybdis between which oncologists and their patients must now chart a very cautious course indeed [40] .",
