For applications like ranking and cost-sensitive classification, probability estimation trees (PETs) are used. These are built using smoothing or calibration techniques. Older smoothing techniques used counts local to a leaf node, but a few more recent techniques consider the broader context of a node when doing estimation. We apply a recent advanced smoothing method called Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) to PETs, and then propose a novel hierarchical smoothing approach called Hierarchical Gradient Smoothing (HGS) as an alternative. HGS smooths leaf nodes up to all the ancestors, instead of recursively smoothing to the parent used by HDP. HGS is made faster by efficiently optimizing the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) loss measure using gradient descent, instead of sampling used in HDP. An extensive set of experiments are conducted on 143 datasets showing that our HGS estimates are not only more accurate but also do so within a fraction of HDP time.

It assumes that the class probability of the leaf node depends on the probabilities of its parents in some hierarchy. To our knowledge, M-branch smoothing [5] is the first and only one hierarchical method for PETs. It smooths the leaf node to its direct parent using M-estimation, with the parent also been smoothed recursively until the root node reached. The results demonstrate that M-branch performs better than M-estimation. Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) [13] can also be used to smooth the probability at the leaves with its parent, partially mimicking what is done in M-branch, but it uses fully Bayesian inference. A decision tree can be turned into a HDP model tree with each node in the tree associated with a Dirichlet Process (DP). Similar HDP smoothing methods allow Bayesian network classifiers [13] and language models [17] to get state-of-the-art probability estimates but has not been applied to decision trees. [14] believe that a thorough study of what are the best smoothing methods for PETs would be a successful contribution to machine learning research, which is also the main aim of this research. We first show that HDP can help PETs get better estimates compared with M-estimation. However, HDP is computationally intensive. A novel, more efficient hierarchical smoothing method called Hierarchical Gradient Smoothing (HGS) is proposed.

Table 1 only gives the averaged running time over all the datasets. Here it is also interesting to investigate the running times based on different data size. Figure 3 is the running time versus data sizes plot for HGS and HDP evaluated on all the datasets. We take the log of both the data sizes and the running times to make the figure more intuitive. It is evident that the blue * are almost always lower than the red circles, which indicates that the training time of HGS on datasets of different sizes is basically shorter than that of HDP.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 83, "end": 90, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 242, "end": 250, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Running Time vs. Data Size"}, {"text": "We sought to determine how many trees are needed in RF to beat HGS on a single tree, and the impact of smoothing with RF.

RF HGS represents random forest using HGS smoothing, while RF means no smoothing. C4.5 with HGS smoothing is represented by line y = 0.24. This figure shows that HGS makes RF worse after three trees because smoothing can reduce the diversity of RF. A single C4.5 tree using HGS yields RMSE better or close to RF with 7 trees and comparatively for 10 trees. While single trees with HGS smoothing cannot beat RF, a single tree is preferred if one is more interested in interpretability.
