[1, 2] From the existing epidemiological data, the transmission speed of COVID-19 is significantly faster than that of SARS, but its pathogenicity is remarkably weaker than that of MERS and SARS. To control the epidemic, the Chinese government has formulated a series of social alienation strategies.

The mask can cover the Seek help from a dermatologist mouth and nose of the wearer and, if worn properly, may effectively help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses and bacteria. [7] During the SARS outbreak in 2003, the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States issued preventive measures in the care of SARS patients, suggesting that the time of exposure to air should be reduced to decrease the probability of airborne droplet transmission. [8] In particular, it is recommended to use protective masks that meet the certification of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. \"N\" stands for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and \"95\" indicates its filtering efficiency. As a result, the mask has a 95% filtration efficiency in filtering particles with a size of \u2265300 nm. The N95 mask can block 95% of the air particles and fits closely with the facial skin to prevent the inhalation of smaller infectious particles, which can travel long distances through the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes. Diseases that require the use of the N95 mask include tuberculosis, chicken pox, SARS, and measles. [9] The diameter of SARS-CoV-2 is between 80 and 120 nm, but when the virus is excreted from an infected person, it will be wrapped in saliva to form larger droplets. Because the N95 mask can effectively filter out particles \u2265300 nm in size, it can effectively block the spread of SARS-CoV-2. [6] HCWs must wear masks for a long period of time every day because of the infectivity of COVID-19. Therefore, it is necessary to detect adverse skin reactions using the N95 mask. Series of researches have explored the related adverse reactions of HCWs wearing N95 mask. Foo et al [6] reported the most common adverse skin reactions were acne, facial itching, and rash. Furthermore, headache was highlighted in Lim research. [10] However, there is no headache in the present study. It probably because the participants in Lim research have been wearing N95 mask for >1 year and the long-term utilization could result in hypoxemia and hypercapnia which led to headache. In this study, we found that the most common adverse reaction of the N95 mask was nasal bridge scarring, followed by facial pruritus. Because the medical staff must have adequate personal protection, they will tie the mask tightly and squeeze the metal clip hard to ensure the tightness of the mask. Therefore, the scar on the bridge of the nose may be caused by the excessive pressure of the mask and the hardness of the metal clip. The cause of itching may be discomfort due to wearing a mask for too long a period of a time, combined with an excessively humid internal environment. Itching may also result from irritating contact dermatitis attributed to an allergic reaction to the mask material. Skin damage may be due to the excessive binding of the mask, such that the edge of the mask is in close contact with the skin, coupled with wearing the mask for a long period of time. [11] In light of the above situations, when wearing a mask, HCWs can reduce the intensity of binding to achieve moderate tightness, gently pinch the metal clip at the bridge of the nose, and add a surgical mask to line the inside of the N95 mask, which can effectively reduce adverse skin reactions.",

            "text": "It has been reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted through contact, so hand protection is one of the most important ways of preventing COVID-19 infection. [5] Wearing latex gloves can effectively prevent the chance of contact infection among HCWs. The most common adverse reactions to wearing latex gloves in this study were dry skin, itching, and rash. It was similar to the skin adverse reactions of wearing gloves during SARS. [6] There may be 3 reasons why these situations occur. One is Immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity to latex [12, 13] ; the second is latex allergy [14] ; and the third may be irritant contact dermatitis, [15] which arises from repeated hand washing with soap and detergent and not completely drying the hands. Therefore, the inside of the glove will not be able to absorb air, resulting in irritation. If it is a dry powder glove, it is likely to be caused by the stimulation of talcum powder in the gloves. In this case, it is necessary to rinse off the soap or detergent before putting on gloves and dry one's hands before wearing gloves. If the gloves are dry, there should not be too much talcum powder inside. Another solution is to wear a layer of plastic gloves inside the latex gloves. These measures can prevent the occurrence of irritant dermatitis. If the symptoms of irritant contact dermatitis cannot be resolved, latex allergy testing is necessary, and latex gloves should be avoided. [16] HCWs must wear protective clothing for a long period of time every day to protect themselves. Therefore, adverse skin reactions have emerged. The adverse skin reactions of HCWs who have been using protective clothing are relatively less common. The most common symptoms were dry skin and itching. The main reason for these situations is probably due to the protective clothing being muggy and the need to wear it for a long period of time. The frequent replacement of protective clothing can effectively reduce the occurrence of the above symptoms.",

These adverse skin reactions are usually mild because most HCWs continue to use the equipment. Therefore, the wearer will not seek the help of a dermatologist or self-medicate. In our study, skin adverse reactions using PPE were mainly concentrated in itching and rash. So, we suggest that after the occurrence of adverse skin reactions, second-generation antihistamines or glucocorticoids were recommended for HCWs. If any serious adverse skin reactions to PPE occurred or medicine administration was ineffective, they should seek help from a dermatologist. To date, there have been no reports of adverse skin reactions caused by the use of PPE in COVID-19. The adverse skin reactions of HCWs reported in questionnaires cannot be verified by professionals, as they are the subjective assessment of HCWs. Nevertheless, the study provides a perspective on the incidence of adverse skin reactions that can be caused by the long-term use of PPE.",
