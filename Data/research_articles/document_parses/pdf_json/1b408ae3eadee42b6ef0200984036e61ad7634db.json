If the lesion appears to require a biopsy, the biopsy may be postponed depending on the health care system constraints during COVID-19. Of note, virtual melanoma checks should be used with caution for high risk patients with suspected malignant pigmented lesions, as any delay in diagnosis for such patients may be particularly problemantic. 3 Additionally, those who are frail or elderly may require the most training or assistance with conducting virtual melanoma checks.",

Remove any jewellery. 3. Move anything creating a shadow out of the way, including your hair. 4. If your photos are coming out blurry, ask a second person to help you with photo taking, especially in hard-to-reach body locations. 5. Take two photos of each skin spot or mole \uf0be The first photo is an overview image of the skin spot or mole. Hold the camera approximately 20cm from the skin spot or mole. Point to the skin spot or mole if there are multiple skin spots visible in the photo. Move the camera until you have a clear photo, then hold the camera still and take the image. \uf0be The second photo is a dermoscopic image (if applicable).Dermoscopic images are magnified close-up images. When using the dermatoscope place the lens directly contacting the skin. 6. When photographing the lesion hold the camera horizontally each time to ensure the same orientation. 7. Ensure the skin spot or mole is in the centre of the image. 8. Record the body location. 9. In the notes or comments section select any symptoms that may describe the skin sport or mole photographed such as: \uf0be change in size or shape \uf0be more raised \uf0be change in colour \uf0be more than 2 colours \uf0be itchy \uf0be bleeding \uf0be scaly or rough surface \uf0be sore or painful \uf0be duration of lesion.",
