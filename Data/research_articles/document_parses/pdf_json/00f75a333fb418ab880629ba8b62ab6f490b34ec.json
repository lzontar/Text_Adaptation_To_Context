No major difference was observed with regards to clinical findings and growth depression when inocula from poults of different age groups were used. Brown et al. (1997) and Davis et al.

Perry et al. (1991b) also recorded decreased weight gain in turkey poults placed on contaminated litter obtained from poults suffering from poult enteritis. In the present study, inoculation of sediment suspension caused a maximum decrease in BW of turkey poults followed by unfiltered supernatant and filtered supernatant (except experiment 2), indicating that the presence of enteric bacteria in sediment may have increased the severity of growth depression induced by enteric viruses. This observation is supported by Guy et al. (2000) , who observed high mortality and increased growth depression in turkey poults inoculated with turkey coronavirus and enteropathogenic E. coli than those inoculated with turkey coronavirus or E. coli alone. Torres-Medina (1984) reported that calves infected with rotavirus and enterotoxic E. coli had a more severe infection than observed with either alone. In the present study, the only exception was experiment 2, in which filtered supernatant-treated poults had the lowest BW followed by sediment-treated and unfiltered supernatant-treated poults. Although it is difficult to explain the reason for such variation from other experiments, it may have been due to variation in the amount of pathogens present in inocula used for different experiments. The difference in the virulence of various strains may also account for some of these differences. Loss in BW in the present study can be attributed to decreased feed intake, poor feed conversion efficiency, or both. Although feed intake was not monitored, the staff in isolation units empirically observed that poults in treated groups consumed relatively less feed compared with controls. Damage caused to the intestinal tract by viruses or Salmonella, or both, may have led to poor feed conversion efficiency. In the present study, we observed an overall growth depression of 31.8% due to PES in all 5 experiments. A growth depression of this magnitude would have serious economic consequences. Barnes et al. (2000) reported that estimated losses to the US turkey industry from 10 to 15% growth depression due to poult enteritis complex (PEC, a term that includes infectious intestinal diseases like coronavirus enteritis, maldigestion syndrome, runting and stunting syndrome of turkeys, poult malabsorption syndrome, stunting syndrome, PEMS, SMT, and turkey viral enteritis of poults) would be between US$300 and US$400 million annually. Under field conditions, several stressors operate that may complicate the situation, further affecting the growth of the birds. Davis et al. (1997) observed 49% BW depression in turkey poults inoculated with filtered intestine-pancreas homogenate collected from turkeys suffering from SMT. The homogenate contained rotavirus, enterovirus-like virus, and birnavirus. These authors believed that this growth depression was due to these and other undetected viruses present in the homogenate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 106, "end": 126, "text": "(Brown et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 127, "end": 146, "text": "Davis et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 147, "end": 168, "text": "Qureshi et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 169, "end": 197, "text": "Schultz-Cherry et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 200, "end": 220, "text": "Perry et al.

The period of observation in experiments 2 and 4 was increased keeping in view the lameness observed in the first experiment at 11 DPI. We extended the observation period to gain a better understanding of progression of the disease, particularly the lameness. Poults undergo rapid skeletal growth during first 4 wk of age and during this period their demand for vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus for incorporation of mineral into the skeleton is at its maximum (Bar et al., 1982) . With early enteric disease, malabsorption of these vital nutrients occurs thus leading to skeletal deformities. Lameness may have contributed to a decrease in BW due to the inability of lame poults to reach up to the feeders or waterers properly. Statistically significant treatment \u00d7 age interactions in 4 of 5 experiments indicated that PES material produced significant adverse effects on the growth of turkey poults.

Rotavirus and astrovirus were detected in the intestinal contents of treated poults at different intervals in all experiments. Similarly, Salmonella was isolated from tissue pools of poults in the treated groups but not in all experiments. In addition, in experiment 1, we also detected enterovirus from pooled intestinal contents. Yason and Schat (1986) demonstrated the presence of rotavirus in intestinal contents of rotavirus-inoculated poults even at 24 DPI. Similarly, Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2008) detected astrovirus in cloacal swabs of all inoculated poults at all intervals postinoculation. Increased detection of rotavirus by RT-PCR as compared with electron microscopy is not surprising because electron microscopy is comparatively less sensitive than RT-PCR. Neither inocula nor intestinal contents from treated birds were positive for coronavirus. The risk of misidentification or misclassification of a virus on electron microscopy has been previously recognized (van Regenmortel et al., 2000) . Although small round viruses (astrovirus, enterovirus, and enterovirus-like particles) with distinct morphologies are visible by electron microscopy (Caul and Appleton, 1982) , their characteristic morphology may change or become less prominent because of the emergence of new subgroups and strains within these viruses; hence, viral diagnosis must not rely solely on morphology but should also include a set of other characteristics (Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002) . It could be the reason for misidentification of astrovirus by enterovirus in some of the samples on electron microscopy. This finding has the support of Guy et al. (2004) , who tentatively identified a small round virus isolated from droppings of turkeys as enterovirus on the basis of size and intracytoplasmic morphogenesis. However, RT-PCR with astrovirus capsid and polymerase-specific primers revealed this isolate as turkey astrovirus. Viruses other than rotavirus and astrovirus that have been found associated with PEC are turkey coronavirus (Guy, 1998; Ismail et al., 2003; Teixeira et al., 2007) , reovirus (Heggen-Peay et al., 2002) , and adenovirus (Sharma, 1991; Suresh and Sharma, 1996) .

Rotavirus replicates primarily in the cytoplasm of mature epithelial cells lining the upper portions of intestinal villi where they cause destruction of mature villous epithelium leading to its replacement by immature epithelium. The immature epithelium has impaired absorptive ability and lacks disaccharides leading to diarrhea due to malabsorption and maldigestion (Moon, 1994) . Rotaviral enteritis in turkeys has been described in many different countries (McNulty et al., 1978 (McNulty et al., , 1979 Saif et al., 1985; Theil and Saif, 1987) . Rotavirus has also been detected in cases of runting and stunting syndrome in broiler chicks (Otto et al., 2006) . Astroviruses were first identified in 1980 in the United Kingdom from turkey poults suffering with diarrhea (McNulty et al., 1980) and were subsequently reported from the United States (TAstV-1; Saif et al., 1985; Reynolds and Saif, 1986 ). Later, a second turkey astrovirus (TAstV-2), genetically distinct from TAsV-1, was characterized (Koci et al., 2000b; Schultz-Cherry et al., 2000 , 2001 . Astroviruses have also been found to be associated with PEMS (Koci et al., 2000b; . How turkey astroviruses induce diarrhea is still not clear, but Reynolds and Schultz-Cherry (2003) attribute induction of diarrhea to the osmotic effects of undigested, unabsorbed nutrients attracting water to the intestinal lumen. Koci et al. (2003) reported that astrovirus-induced diarrhea does not involve extensive destruction of enterocytes in the villous epithelium or increased inflammatory response, whereas Moser et al. (2007) attributed it to increased intestinal barrier permeability leading to more fluid in the intestinal lumen. Astroviruses cause a significant decrease in d-xylose absorption in turkey poults (Reynolds and Saif, 1986) and a decrease in maltase activity thereby leading to disaccharide maldigestion and malabsorption (Thouvenelle et al., 1995) . Enterovirus also replicates in the intestine particularly in the jejunum and ileum, in the villus epithelium located halfway between the tip and base of the villus (McNulty and . Enterovirus has been detected in the feces of young turkeys by various workers (Saif et al., 1985 (Saif et al., , 1990 Reynolds et al., 1987) .
