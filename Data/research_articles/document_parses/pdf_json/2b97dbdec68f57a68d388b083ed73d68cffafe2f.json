In addition, concerns have also been raised by neurologists In absence of epidemiological data comparing the incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 in the DBS versus non-DBS PD population, no conclusions can be made concerning possible increased risk of severe COVID-19 complications in DBS PD patients. Therefore, these case reports not only highlight the unusual COVID-19 manifestation in PD patients with DBS, contributing to the delay in their diagnosis, but more importantly, they stress the need for a registry to collect data regarding the impact of COVID-19, along with outcomes, in patients with movement disorders.",

The extreme difficulty of executing regular visits with their neurologists, physical and speech therapists, and primary care providers has often worsened the clinical conditions of many 4 patients with PD, dystonia, Huntington disease, and tics. To address these issues, several actions have been implemented. Perhaps, the most commonly and successfully executed has been telemedicine [3, 8] . Some countries, such as the United States and Canada, have already been used to this tool even prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, while others had to urgently initiate this program during the pandemic, such as Italy. When time is not a factor, the ease and efficacy of telemedicine in providing neurological care has been well documented. At the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, for example, prior to the pandemic we reported our experience of 3,913 neurological patients completing 5,581 virtual visits [9] . The number of virtual visits increased from 30 in best determine their parkinsonian patients' needs, thereby concentrating the need for more complex virtual visits with neurologists to a manageable volume. Finally, the lack of accessibility to rehabilitation, physiotherapy and any type of exercise due to the lockdown does not favor PD patients. Therefore, Srivastav and Samuel summarized the available web-based tools to download for patients to maintain mobility and enhance quality of life.",

To date, there is no strong evidence supporting these concerns. However, some authors have reported COVID-19 related deaths in elderly parkinsonian patients with longstanding deep brain stimulation [7]. 3 This month's edition of Parkinsonism and Related Disorders puts on the spotlight 3 articles, providing us with a snapshot of how COVID-19 has affected patients with movement disorders, and the adaptive solutions implemented in different regions of the world in providing acute, as well as supportive care for their patients. Hainque and Grabli warn clinicians about the atypical manifestation of COVID-19 in two PD patients with deep brain stimulators (DBS), eventually leading to their demise. Cilia, et al. narrate the devastation caused by COVID-19 in the northern region of Italy that forced them to adopt an innovative two-tiered telemedicine model, designed to efficiently triage the care of PD patients and conserve (or, more likely, \"stretch\") the care expended by neurologists. And finally, Srivastav and Samuel. from India remind us of creative solutions, utilizing web-and virtual-based platforms in providing the necessary physical therapy and exercises when mobility poses a significant hurdle, and social distancing becomes the new way of life.",
