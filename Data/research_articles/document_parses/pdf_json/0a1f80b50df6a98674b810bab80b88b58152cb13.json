For the fulfillment of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, the promotion of preventive care medicine through HAI management is a crucial issue. This study explores the perspectives of Saudi tertiary healthcare workers (HCWs) on HAIs and infection control measures. Methods: Quantitative data were assessed to determine HCWs' knowledge of HAI and their attitudes towards and practice of infection control measures. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data from 40 doctors and nurses. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Further, routine sterile procedures in the wards and intensive care units were video recorded, and the footage was discussed by the infection control team and the personnel involved in the videos. This discussion was videographed and transcribed. Both interview data and reflective discussion of the video were analysed using thematic analysis. The quantitative data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and logistic regression analysis.",

However, most are prevalence and epidemiological studies on the different types of HAIs, especially deviceassociated HAI or studies on the microbiological profile of various HAIs [5] [6] [7] . Studies from Riyadh and Abha have reported a prevalence of HAI to be between 8 and 8.5% [8, 9] . Some studies in Saudi Arabia, however, have focused on HCWs' knowledge of HAI, attitude, and practice of infection control measures; one study identified a gap in knowledge but failed to analyse in-depth the reason for it [10] . In addition, several studies have focused on the knowledge and practice of hand hygiene and ignored other aspects of infection control [11, 12] . Our study has aimed to analyse the knowledge, attitude towards HAI and practice of infection control measures in a more detailed method and has strived to study the perspectives of HCW using the qualitative Analysis and Video reflexive ethnography (VRE). The reason for choosing the Maternity and paediatric hospital for conducting this study is the report of the high periodic prevalence of 19.2% and an incidence of 13.7 HAI infections per 1000 patient days in recent years [13] .",

However, it is unclear if infection control protocols, as instituted by this centre, are being followed in all tertiary care hospitals in GCC countries. An ongoing problem faced by the Kingdom since 2012 is outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections and now the recent outbreak of COVID-19 all over the world. Strict infection policies and effective use of personal protective equipment (PPE) can prevent the spread of MERS-CoV and COVID-19 [16] . All HCWs must use standard precautions related to droplet, contact, and airborne infection to contain and curb the spread of HAIs [17] . Our study highlights lapses in infection control practices, especially in the use of PPE., and makes us to speculate if these deficiencies can enhance the spread of airborne endemic infections like MERS-CoV and pandemic infections like COVID-19.",

The final questionnaire was refined and developed as per the needs of the study and consisted of nineteen knowledge questions, ten attitude questions, and eight practice questions (Additional file 1). The participants were scored out of a total score of 37. All the positive answers under the three sections were given a score of 1. The negative answers were given a score of 0, except for a few questions. For example, the participants were scored as one if they had attended more than one workshop and 0 if they had participated in none. Similarly, the participants were given a scoring of 1 and 0 as per the preferences they chose in the questionnaire.",

The initial phase involved the identification of the interested health care workers who further identified more healthcare workers.

Semi-structured interviews were used to gain an understanding of how HCWs interpret HAI and examine their experience in tackling HAI and associated infection control measures. We followed an interview guide (Additional file 2) comprising of open-ended questions on existing HAI and infection control practices/guidelines in the healthcare facility, as well as HCWs' awareness of HAI and the need for safe infection control measures. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim immediately after obtaining written informed consent from the participants. Thematic analysis was then used to extract essential themes and patterns [24] . The transcripts were coded manually; we organized codes into categories and constantly revised themes, categories, and codes as we progressed through the data analysis. The codes were used to organize, analyse, and examine the data in a structured way.

The participants recruited for VRE were the same ones who had participated in the qualitative study. An entire routine sterile procedure performed by five teams of three or more participants in the intensive care unit (ICU) setup was recorded right from pre-procedure hand hygiene measures until its conclusion. The footage was then shown to a focus group consisting of two paediatricians, an infection control nurse, and the principal researcher. Lapses in infection control practice were identified, and solutions discussed, and the edited video footage was presented to the participants featured in the video recordings. Feedback sessions were conducted with the participants who had performed the sterile procedures and featured in the videos.

In our study, participants were aware of the existence of an infection control department in their hospital that functioned in line with CDC guidelines. Studies have demonstrated that many HCWs have inadequate motivation for practicing handwashing techniques and that there is a lack of regular monitoring of compliance with handwashing practices. The lack of motivation may arise from a lack of positive feedback for proper handwashing practices [37] . In our study, regular monitoring of handwashing compliance was conducted, and most HCWs stated that they performed adequate handwashing procedures; this was especially true of nurses, who also actively monitored handwashing practices of other HCWs. The motivation was further boosted via an annual 'hand hygiene week,' where the most active participants were rewarded. However, the VRE results demonstrated an apparent lapse in handwashing techniques among residents as compared Make it mandatory for all nurses to wear a surgical mask over the face cover (if worn) during procedures Crossover of non-sterile items into the sterile zone",
