This task might take an analyst a few days or weeks to accomplish -which is almost certainly inexpensive compared to the cost of building a new information system that could do this task almost immediately. For many purposes, it may be useful and suffi cient to be able to display multiple streams of surveillance or programmatic data in the same environment, on the same screen or even in the same chart. In Florida, de-identifi ed reportable disease case information and death certifi cate information are imported into the ESSENCE analytic environment that was originally designed for syndromic surveillance [ 1 ] , so that trends for similar conditions by age, sex, and geographic area in the two data streams can be easily compared. On the other hand, if it is desired to have real-time information available to the STD clinic staff about past diagnoses of hepatitis B, or about past receipt of hepatitis B vaccine, then information systems need to be designed to support this kind of look-up; the usual solution is a shared person index between the two systems. Alternatively, a common data repository can be designed in which all information about each person is permanently linked.",

For which constellations of fi ndings in the electronic health record would this be appropriate? Should some electronic case reports generated by electronic health record systems be passed to state or even federal public health offi cials before they are reviewed and validated at the local or state levels? If so, which ones? As always, there is a tension between the speed of information fl ow and its quality and completeness. There is a need for research to determine which constellations of fi ndings in electronic health records have adequate specifi city and sensitivity to warrant automated identifi cation of a person as being likely to have a case of a reportable disease. The acceptable sensitivity and specifi city will vary by disease.",

This document identifi es a set of key attributes of surveillance systems to be assessed during a surveillance system evaluation, including simplicity, fl exibility, data quality, acceptability, sensitivity, predictive value positive, representativeness, timeliness, and stability. These are also useful attributes to consider when designing a surveillance information system [ 9 ] . The relative importance of these attributes will vary depending on the condition under surveillance and the main purposes for surveillance. For example, a surveillance system to detect cases of botulism for immediate public health response puts a high premium on timeliness, and its operators are likely to be willing to accept a modest number of false-positive reports (a lower positive predictive value ) in order to assure that reports are received very quickly. On the other hand, surveillance to support planning of cancer prevention programs and treatment services is less time-sensitive, given the quite long incubation periods for most cancers, and therefore more concerned with diagnostic accuracy of every case report than with speed of reporting. Timeliness, positive predictive value, and sensitivity of a public health surveillance system are always in tension with each other; increasing two of these always compromises the third.",

Reportable diseases are determined by each state; clinicians, hospitals, and/or laboratories must report to public health when these conditions are identifi ed. Some reportable conditions are also nationally notifi able. Deidentifi ed cases of these are voluntarily notifi ed by states and territories to CDC, which, in collaboration with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, maintains a listing of nationally notifi able conditions that includes both infectious (e.g., rabies, TB) and non-infectious (e.g., blood lead, cancer) conditions [ 23 ] .",

ELR refers to the secure, electronic, standards-based reporting of laboratory data to public health. ELR implementation has been steadily escalating since its inception around the year 2000, replacing previous reporting systems that relied on slower, more labor-intensive paper reporting. The ELR National Working Group conducted annual surveys from 2004 to 2011 [ 24 ] which gathered data from all 50 states as well as from several territories and large metropolitan areas. These data were supplemented with data for years 2000-2004, retroactively gathered in the 2010 survey. The tracked growth of ELR (Fig. 14.1 ) illustrates its rapid rise in the US, from the start of early stage planning to fully operational ELR [ 25 ] .",

ELR also is expected to reduce the number of missed cases, as automated systems do not require laboratory staff to actively remember to make case reports, and to improve the item-level completeness and quality of case reports. Although experience shows that the expected improvements in timeliness, sensitivity, completeness, and accuracy are generally being realized [ 27 ] , timeliness may not be improved substantially for those diseases where clinicians routinely report based on clinical suspicion without waiting for laboratory confi rmation (for example, meningococcal disease) [ 28 ] . In addition, laboratories (especially referral laboratories) often do not have access in their own information systems to home addresses for people whose specimens they are testing, and have struggled with providing complete demographic information to public health agencies. Implementation of an operational ELR system is not a trivial undertaking. Laboratories must confi gure data into an acceptable message format, most commonly Health Level Seven (HL7 \u00ae ) [ 29 ] . Laboratory tests and results should be reported with correlated vocabulary or content codes. Two of the most common code systems used for laboratory tests and their associated results are Logical Observations Identifi ers Names and Codes (LOINC \u00ae ) [ 30 ] and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED CT \u00ae ) [ 31 ] . Neither of these systems is suffi cient by itself to encode all the information needed for public health surveillance.",
