Interestingly, RBD-dimer is arranged as a \"bilateral-lung\"-like structure with axial 172 symmetry ( Figure 2A ). The dual RBMs are located at the lower lobes of both \"lungs\" facing 173 outwards against the axis (Figure 2A ). Both RBMs are fully exposed (Figure 2A and Figure  174 S1), suggesting the potential to elicit antibodies interfering with receptor binding. The core 175 subdomains of both RBD protomers stack on each other via \u03b13 helices and loops surrounding 176 the helices. The N-and C-termini are invisible in the electron density maps, indicating the 177 flexibility of these regions. Accordingly, in the previously determined structure of the 178 full-length MERS-CoV-S, these regions consist of flexible loops which facilitate the 179 hinge-like conformational movements of RBD for receptor engagement (Yuan et al., 2017) . 180 Each RBD contains 9 cysteine residues, with 8 of them forming 4 intra-molecule disulfide 181",

Given the 183 number of flexible, unresolved residues that link the two subunits of the dimer together, and 184 the small non-covalent interface observed between the two subunits of the dimer, it is far 185 from certain that the crystallographically observed structure corresponds to a unique structure 186 the protein adopts in solution. 187 188 Structure-guided design of the RBD-sc-dimer 189 Since the RBD forms a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution, the yields of dimer protein 190 varied from batch to batch. To facilitate downstream vaccine development, we sought to 191 further engineer the RBD-dimer in a more stable form. The structure of RBD-dimer showed both N-and C-termini of two RBD protomers were juxtaposed and 193 closed to each other (Figure 2A ), which inspired us to link these two RBD as a tandem repeat 194 single chain. In order to avoid introducing any exogenous sequences, we sought to link them 195 by their own flexible terminal residues. Both RBDs were truncated at N602, the position just 196 before C603 to avoid potential instability caused by cysteine residue, and then connected in 197 tandem ( Figure 2B ). RBD expressed in a mammalian cell system was previously reported to 198 be able to induce stronger neutralizing antibody response than those expressed in insect cells 199 (Du et al., 2009b) . We, therefore, constructed and expressed immunogens switching from 200 insect cells to mammalian cells. The RBD-sc-dimer was expressed in mammalian HEK293T 201 cells. The supernatant of the transfected cells was collected for further purification. Analytical 202 gel filtration showed that the new construct was expressed as a single peak with a size of ~60 203 kDa, indicating the dimeric form of RBD ( Figure 2C ). The molecular weight was further 204 corroborated as 60.7 kDa by analytical ultracentrifugation ( Figure 2D ). Surface plasmon 205 resonance (SPR) assay demonstrated the RBM is exposed in the RBD-sc-dimer as in 206 conventional RBD-monomer, supported by the comparable binding affinities of RBD to its 207 receptor hCD26 ( Figure 2E ). 208 12 The RBD construct for SARS-CoV-2 started at R319 (the E367 position of MERS-CoV S 231 protein) and was truncated at C-terminal residue K537, the amino acid just before C603 232 position of MERS-CoV S protein ( Figure S2 and Figure 3A ). Two copies of RBD were then 233 dimerized in tandem as the strategy described for MERS-CoV RBD-sc-dimer ( Figure 3A) . 234 SARS-CoV-2 RBD was expressed as a single dimer-sized protein, as verified by analytical 235 gel filtration and gel electrophoresis ( Figure 3A ). Further analytical ultracentrifugation 236 determined its molecular weight as 61.7 kDa, suggesting a stable dimer formation ( Figure 3B) . 237",

Consistent with what was found in assessment of MERS and COVID-19 272 vaccines, RBD-sc-dimer significantly enhanced the antigen-specific antibody responses and after the second immunization (Figure 4D-E). 275 276 High-yields of RBD-sc-dimer in industry-standard CHO cell system 277 In view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and frequent MERS outbreaks, we sought to 278 further develop vaccines against these two CoVs for pilot scale production in GMP grade 279 manufacturing. The RBD-sc-dimers of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were constructed 280 without purification tag and subsequently transformed to clinical-grade CHO cell lines. Stable 281 CHO cell lines were screened for antigen expression. Cell lines with highest antigen 282 abundance were selected for large-scale production. Notably, both RBD-sc-dimers can be 283 produced at high-yields, to the level of gram per liter. The RBD-sc-dimer of MERS-CoV 284 reached expression levels of > 2 g/L, with a final yield of 1.05 gram purified antigen per liter 285 (Figure 5A). The RBD-sc-dimer of SARS-CoV-2 can reach expression levels of > 1.5 g/L, 286 with a final yield of 0.67 gram purified antigen per liter (Figure 5A). Both antigens reached > 287 98% purity as verified by gel electrophoresis analyses (Figure 5A-B). The highly scalable 288 production of these two immunogens strongly suggested the feasibility to meet the vaccine 289 demands worldwide. 290 291 DISCUSSION 292 In general, the current CoV vaccine candidates can be classified into two categories: (i) 293 gene-based vaccines including DNA/messenger RNA vaccines, recombinant vaccine vectors 294 and live-virus vaccines, which produce antigens in host cells, and (ii) protein-based vaccines 295 including inactivated whole virus and protein subunit vaccine, whose antigens are 296 manufactured in vitro (Graham, 2020). Protein subunit vaccines have been traditionally used 297 for vaccine development and such vaccines have good safety and effectiveness profiles in 298",

However, as 310 antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) have been reported for CoV immune response 311 (Corapi et al., 1992; Hohdatsu et al., 1998; Jaume et al., 2011; Kam et al., 2007; Vennema et 312 al., 1990; Wan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2014), minimized effective immunogens are sought. 313 Alternatively, the RBD of CoV S protein has been recognized as an attractive vaccine target 314 because of its advantages in immune focusing (Du et al., 2009a; Jiang et al., 2012; Ma et al., 315 2014; Wang et al., 2020b; Zhang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2019b), but may require effective 316 adjuvant and multiple doses to evoke adequate immunogenicity. We identified the generalizable strategy for beta-CoV vaccine design. Actually, two immunizations of 321 RBD-sc-dimers were already sufficient to maximize a high levels of antibody responses for 322 all tested vaccines against MERS, COVID-19 and SARS (Figure 2F-G; Figure 3D-E and 323",
