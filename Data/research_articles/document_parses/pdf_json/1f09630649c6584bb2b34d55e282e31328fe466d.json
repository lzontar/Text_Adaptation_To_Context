However, establishing the source of infection to ascertain the possible extent of spread can be difficult, because scant epidemiological data might be available. Even when possible nodes of transmission are retrospectively identified through epidemiological investigations, nucleic acid-based tests would not be diagnostically useful if these infected individuals have recovered and no longer shed the virus. Hence, serological tests are needed to identify convalescent cases and aid investigations and containment efforts.",

On Jan 2, 2020, a suspect case-definition of COVID-19 was circulated to all doctors in Singapore; 4 doctors are legally required to notify the Ministry of Health of cases of COVID-19. 5 From Jan 31, 2020, Singapore began testing all patients with pneumonia in hospital for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); this testing was later expanded to include people with pneumonia in primary care. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed either by a respiratory sample testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 using a laboratory-based RT-PCR 6 or by a serum sample testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on serological analysis. 7 Once individuals with COVID-19 were identified, their activities from 14 days before symptom onset until they were isolated were mapped and their close contacts traced. Contact tracing before symptom onset was done to identify the source of exposure that led to the case being infected, allowing for further active case-finding around the source. Contact tracing after symptom onset until isolation was done to identify exposed individuals for quarantine to break the transmission chain. Both these approaches were part of the containment strategy. A close contact was defined as anyone who had prolonged contact within 2 m of the case. All close contacts with active or recent symptoms were tested, whereas those who were asymptomatic and exposed while the case was symptomatic were quarantined. Activity maps were reviewed and crosschecked to establish potential expo sures and identify possible epidemiological links between cases and clusters.",

Challenges include difficulty in obtaining information from cases and contacts, which could be inaccurate because of recall and other biases. In our investigation, information for symptom onset of W1 and W2 was based on case history alone and could not be independently corroborated. 5 In such instances, determining the transmission chain would have to account for possible inconsistencies in case history and rely on triangulation with other methods.

Identifying people who were probably infected in household or school clusters could help ascertain attack rates by age, particularly among children who mostly manifest less severe disease. 18 Calculating population-level attack rates is also important to estimate disease incidence and the case-fatality rate (CFR). Thus far, the CFR for COVID-19 has been based on PCRdiagnosed symptomatic cases. Serological surveys would be important to estimate CFR more accurately and would better inform calibrated responses to COVID-19. As the pandemic progresses, monitoring seroprevalence would enable countries to track transmission dynamics and population immunity levels and to inform disease control policies.
