The possibility of release of an aerosolized and/or bioengineered virus must be anticipated and planned for. The transmission and infectivity of variola virus are examined. Arguments for and against pre-event vaccination are offered. The likely morbidity and mortality that would ensue from implementation of a mass pre-event vaccination program, within reasonable boundaries, are known. The extent of contagion that could result from an aerosolized release of virus is unknown and may have been underestimated. Pre-event vaccination of first responders is urged, and voluntary vaccination programs should be offered to the public. Two defenses against a vaccine-resistant, engineered variola virus are proposed for consideration. Methisazone, an overlooked drug, is reported to be effective for prophylaxis only. The extent of reduction in the incidence of smallpox with use of this agent is uncertain. It is useless for treatment of clinical smallpox. N-100 respirators (face masks) worn by uninfected members of the public may prevent transmission of the virus.",

In addition to the possible existence of more-virulent \"weaponized\" strains, further advances in genetic engineering may permit construction of strains able to evade the current vaccine. Australian workers markedly increased mousepox virulence by splicing a mouse IL-4 gene into a laboratory strain [10] ; similar constructions might be assembled using human smallpox virus (Variola major) or another pox virus (e.g., monkeypox virus) and human genes [11] . This article critically examines some of the current tenets of public health policy and highlights the uncertainty of much of the data.

Freefloating aerosolized virions, on the other hand, would have a considerably more extensive range. In 1962, Dixon [14] reviewed the evidence for the alternative mode-aerosolized spread-and concluded that true airborne infection was extremely rare. Nonetheless, epidemiological evidence suggests that transmission by means of aerosolized particles may be a real occurrence.",

Examinations of outbreaks in India and Pakistan in the 1960s showed that each case of smallpox gave rise to only 3 new cases during the infectious (dry) season and to 1 new case during the humid season [3] . Such observations-along with the long incubation period of smallpox (mean, 12-14 days; range, 7-21 days)suggest that there would be adequate time to vaccinate the public and prevent a more widespread outbreak. Not revealed in these reports is the extent to which the affected public had already been vaccinated. If the percentage of the population that had been vaccinated was high, the aforementioned findings may merely reflect the population's immune status, rather than a low attack rate. Another report placed the vaccination level in India at that time at 80% [18] . If accurate, this would support the reason for the low attack rate as being a consequence of a public protected by immunization, rather than due to a virus with low inherent infectivity. Indeed, there are data that smallpox is highly contagious. During the period of endemic smallpox, in field studies in Africa, 30% of susceptible contacts became infected [19] . Other sources report attack rates of anywhere from 37% to 88% among unvaccinated contacts [20] .",

Postvaccinial encephalitis or encephalomyelitis has been reported to occur at an incidence of 1 case per 300,000 vaccinations [21] . In recent data from an ongoing Department of Defense (DOD) study, there was 1 case of encephalitis reported among 623,244 vaccinations [22] ; the patient recovered. There was no evidence by either viral culture or PCR for vaccinia being the etiology. Progressive vaccinia (a postvaccination viral dissemination with subsequent shock and localized gangrene) occurs in persons with immunodeficiencies, and eczema vaccinatum (a generalized spread of vaccinia to skin beyond the vaccination site) occurs in persons with atopic dermatitis; neither was reported in the DOD study [22] . Fifty cases of contact transfer of vaccinia occurred, primarily in spouses and adult intimate contacts [23] . The lower-than-expected incidence of adverse events may reflect more-careful screening of vaccination candidates for immunosuppression and eczema (for whom vaccination is contraindicated), the generally healthy status of the population being vaccinated, the previous vaccination in up to two-thirds of vaccine recipients, and covering of the vaccination site, which reduces inadvertent inoculation of contacts. (In previous vaccination campaigns, the vaccination site was left exposed.)",

Vis-\u00e0-vis smallpox, the immune status of the older portion of our population is uncertain. It was generally accepted that the immunity provided by vaccination deteriorates with time. Two-thirds of persons with smallpox in the 1960s had preexisting vaccination scars [19] . However, Hammarlund et al. [36] found substantial humoral and or cellular immunity against vaccinia persisting in persons who had been vaccinated 25-75 years earlier and cite epidemiological studies that argue for long-term protection. Regardless, the immune status of our younger population (i.e., those aged !37 years), with regard to smallpox, probably resembles the status of the Aztec, Inca, and 17th Century American Indian populations, rather than that of a vaccinated people. It is possible, therefore, that each index case would give rise to considerably more than just the 3 secondary cases in the outbreaks that occurred after World War II. As is reported in a consensus statement by smallpox authorities, \"A clandestine release of smallpox, even if it infected only 50-100 persons to produce the first generation of cases, would spread rapidly in a now highly susceptible population, expanding by a factor or 10-20 times or more with each generation of cases\" [22, p. 2132 ]. This pattern of spread likely occurred in the population of central Mexico, which, according to Aztec tribute rolls taken before their exposure to smallpox in the early 1500s, was 25 million. The Spanish, in 1620, estimated that the population was 1.6 million, but other factors, including measles, also probably played a role in the decline [37] . Bozzette et al. [35] ascribe a mortality rate of 22.5% to the unimmunized population. However, there are data showing a mortality rate of 52% in an unvaccinated population [38] .",

However, the current opinion on how long the virus can remain viable in this state is that the viability rapidly decreases after 60 min (\"no more than 20%-30% survived\" [31, p. 1923] ), implying that there is nil viability left soon thereafter and, thus, that aerosolization does not represent much of a threat [31] . Unfortunately, closer scrutiny of the science underlying that assertion shows less reason to be sanguine. The great majority of the loss in variola virus viability was already present when first measured 5 min into the study. Thereafter, there was but modest further decline over the remaining 60-min length of the study [39] . The virus may therefore persist at a relatively stable level of viability for hours. How long the virus can actually remain aerosolized is unknown, as is its infectivity in this mode. If one extrapolates from the results of studies of vaccinia, aerosolized variola virus that is protected from UV light survives for 24 h [21] .",

On the other hand, dissemination of variola virus into the air (e.g., via crop dusters or bomblets) subjects the virus to variables such as UV light, thermal factors, humidity, and wind. The virus might not survive, or it might be dispersed in the atmosphere into such low concentrations that it is no longer infective.

This finding did not reach statistical significance. Methisazone was stated to be effective prophylaxis in the eighth edition (from 1977) of Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine [51] , but it is doubtful that many made note of it.

In particular, the use of a more virulent, \"weaponized\" strain of smallpox virus could mean that the epidemic would outrun the currently planned postevent vaccination/isolation measures. Although conventional wisdom suggests that smallpox, in its natural state, is largely limited to spread via respiratory droplets, concern about the potential for aerosol transmission is real and might be a greater problem in a developed society with large urban populations. Despite the potential hazards, we believe that greater efforts should be made to promote pre-event immunization-especially in emergency providers and health care workers. Furthermore, consideration should be given to allowing the public voluntary access to the vaccine. With proper informed consent and careful screening to minimize the risk of adverse side effects, such a program could reduce the risk of a runaway epidemic. Because of the possibility of an attack involving bioengineered smallpox virus that is resistant to the current vaccine, methisazone should be reexamined, and research should be continued on other antiviral agents. Also, an adequate supply of masks should be assured. Although unlikely at the present time, the possibility of a future bio-engineered attack using smallpox should not be arbitrarily rejected.",
