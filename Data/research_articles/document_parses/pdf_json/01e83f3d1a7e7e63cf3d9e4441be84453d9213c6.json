It is important now more than ever for clinicians to use compassionate and effective communication skills. Many clinicians have been trained in communication, but a sobering number of trainings show minimal impact on patient outcomes, 1 and even when training is effective, critical care clinicians in particular are facing unprecedented communication challenges. As providers scramble in the wake of Covid-19 to adapt to a new frontier in critical care conversations (including using telehealth for nearly all communication), an age-old question resurfaces: What defines \"good\" clinical communication?",

For example, a healthcare provider can make an empathic statement, but if the provider's tone of voice is patronizing, if there is no meaningful eye contact, or if the patient is seeking prognostic information rather than empathy at that moment, it could actually undermine the therapeutic relationship. Thus, how behaviors are enacted is what matters most in communication, not simply whether certain behaviors are performed.",

            "text": "The quality of communication depends on the degree and breadth of attention to each of the three goals such that communication that juggles relational, task, and identity goals is more effective than communication that ignores any of those goals. The metaphor of juggling three goals offers a compelling alternative to detailed checklists because it provides sufficient flexibility to account for the uniqueness of every interaction while remaining broad enough to apply across different types of clinical conversations and platforms. And the juggling act works-successfully attending to multiple goals has led to positive outcomes for patients and family members in terms of concordance, documentation of medical wishes, decision-making efficacy, and relationship satisfaction. 5 Practically speaking, clinicians juggle relational goals through building rapport, establishing mutual trust, focusing on the patient's emotions, expressing empathy with genuine compassion, and framing the interaction as a partnership with the patient and family (\"I see you're worried; let's work through this together\"). Achieving relational goals is likely even more critical-and challenging-when using telehealth because the in-person body language cues providers rely on to establish rapport are unavailable. When using telehealth, particularly in an ICU, it can be helpful to explicitly state the relational goal of wanting to connect with the patient despite virtual barriers (\"I realize it's harder to talk about this over the computer\").",

My goal is to review the CT scan results and decide together about next steps.\"). Staying engaged and genuinely curious, avoiding distraction, and checking patient or family understanding are all ways to successfully juggle task goals. Typically, when providers keep only one goal \"in the air\" during their juggling act, it is usually the task goal. Accomplishing task goals are essential in an ICU setting, but task-focused conversations about code status (i.e., trying to elicit a DNR) that introduce mistrust or ignore the personhood of the patient can actually compromise the task goal itself if it undermines the ability of the patient or family to make a decision. In other words, conversations start to unravel if clinicians focus on the task at the expense of relational or identity goals.",

Successfully juggling identity goals means not using jargon or a patronizing tone (\"doctor voice\") and avoiding inadvertent dismissal of patient or family concerns or transitioning the conversation before they are ready. In the post-Covid-19 context of uncertainty (e.g., misinformation and questions that currently have no answers), providers attend to identity goals by not becoming defensive during questioning but rather 5 acknowledging frustrations or limitations in knowledge (\"I know it's frustrating that I can't provide you with definitive answers\").",

When all three types of goals are attended to, better communication-and better patient outcomes-occur. 5 Thus, rather than learning to check off boxes, clinicians and their patients may be better served by ditching checklists and instead juggling multiple goals.",
