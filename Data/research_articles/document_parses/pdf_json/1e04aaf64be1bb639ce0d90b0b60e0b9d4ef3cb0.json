A matrix management plan directs team members to the assignment where the need and the benefit derived are the greatest. Based on the SMM mode, the medical staffs from Union Hospital were mainly responsible for the communication with the hospital and other wards, the preparation of standard personal protective equipment (PPE) and sterilizing equipment, the writing of medical records, and the communication with patients and their families to release mental stress. The intensive medical staffs focused on the treatment and care of severe patients.
