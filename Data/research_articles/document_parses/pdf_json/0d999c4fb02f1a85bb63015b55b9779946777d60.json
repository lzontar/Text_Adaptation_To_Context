The epidemiological peak in Belgium was estimated to have occurred around March 31st with 5,759 patients hospitalized on April 6 th and occupancy of deployed national hospital intensive care beds at a maximum of 58% (1285 hospitalized patients in intensive care units (ICU) on April 8 th [1]). Based on previous experience acquired during the SARS-CoV epidemic, healthcare workers (HCW) are considered as a high risk population for SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. Few studies have been published reporting both current and past infection using RT-PCR and/or serological testing [2, 3] . Studies on HCW represent also a unique opportunity to study natural infection in asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic subjects. High viral loads have been detected in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects with similar duration of carriage as compared to symptomatic patients [4, 5] . Seroconversion is well described in hospitalized patients. It is observed in more than 99% within 19 days and levels of antibodies correlate with severity of COVID-19 [6] . However, less is known about seroconversion rate following asymptomatic infection. The primary objective was to assess the rate and dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and seroprevalence among high-risk HCW and hospital staff. This report presents the preliminary results at baseline and 2 weeks follow up.",

Consistently, the percentage of RT-PCR positive tests among staff members of nursing homes in Belgium was 2% during the same period [1]. In contrast, baseline seroprevalence in our study (11 and 12% at Day 1 and Day 15 respectively) was 2.5 times higher than that of Belgian blood donors at the same period (4.3% on April 14 th, Laure Geebelen, Sciensano, personal communication). In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence assessed using the same immunoassay was much lower (1.2%) in a study that included COVID-19 highly exposed healthcare in a German hospital [3] . This could be explained by the fact that this study was performed 2-3 weeks before epidemiological peak while ours was initiated two weeks after the epidemiological peak. This timing might explain the low numbers of positive RT-PCR and the higher seroprevalence rate. Indeed, the phase of the pandemic when these nasopharyngeal carriage and seroprevalence studies are carried out is of crucial importance in comparing numbers.",

Eight out of 10 subjects with positive RT-PCR had a previously confirmed COVID-19 diagnostic. Of note, 1 subject with positive RT-PCR had negative IgG. IgG seroprevalence at baseline was 11% (n=36), with 27 (75%) with negative concomitant RT-PCR. Among these 27 IgG positive/RT-PCR negative subjects, 7 (26%) had concomitant symptoms consisting of dyspnea (n=2), fever (n=1), cough (n=5), sore throat (n=2), headache (n=2), diarrhoea (n=1), myalgia (n=1), conjunctivitis (n=1), loss of smell and/or taste (n=1) and tiredness (n=1). Fourteen out of 27 (52%) IgG positive/PCR negative subjects had a previously confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (mean delay since diagnosis: 29 days). At day 15, 6 subjects remained positive by RT-PCR and two new infections were detected by RT-PCR (total 2.4%). One presented loss of smell and/or taste at baseline (15 days before) but was negative by RT-PCR at day 15 and the other one was asymptomatic. Both were SARS-CoV-2 IgG negative. Three seroconversions were observed between day1 and day15: one in a participant with positive RT-PCR at baseline. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR at any time for the other two subjects: one with a previously confirmed COVID-19 diagnostic (53 days earlier) and the other one fully asymptomatic. No seroreversion was observed in this short interval. Evolution of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests between Day1 and Day 15 are summarized in Figure 1.",
