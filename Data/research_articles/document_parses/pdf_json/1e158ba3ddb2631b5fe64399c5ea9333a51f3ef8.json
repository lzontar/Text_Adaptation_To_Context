The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its symptoms usually include cough, fever, and gastrointestinal problems. Although the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is about 1 % of the global population and RA patients naturally have a chance of acquiring COVID-19 in this pandemic, no studies have considered the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (a receptor for SARS-CoV-2) in synovial tissues. Our presenting data revealed that ACE2 expression was elevated in active rheumatoid synovium, and siRNA against STAT3 was able to downregulate ACE2 expression, which was in turn induced by IL-6 signaling.",

Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, malaise, cough, and in severe cases, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (1, 2) . Coronavirus possesses envelope-anchored spike proteins that bind host cell surface receptors and allow viral entry into target cells. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, its spike protein mediates binding of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (3) . While ACE2 expression levels are relatively low in the airway mucosa and lungs, this protein is predominant in the stomach, intestines, gallbladder, kidney, and heart (4). Therefore, in COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected not only in nasal and oral swabs but also in rectal samples; viral RNA has also been detected in patient blood (5) .",

Reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for ACE2 mRNA extracted from the synovium supported these data ( Figure 1B ). ACE2 expression was found to be increased in the synovial lining and sublining regions, suggesting that its expression was elevated in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Primary cultures of these RA-derived FLS revealed that interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulation increased ACE2 expression ( Figure 1C ). IL-6 is known to regulate downstream target genes via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling activation (9) . IL-6 stimulation led to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (data not shown). Indeed, the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against STAT3 reduced the IL-6-dependent ACE2 expression in RA-FLS ( Figure 1D ).",

All experiments were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines. Synovial tissues were collected from 16 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients that fulfilled the classification criteria of the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (Arthritis and Rheum. 1988; 31: 315-324) and underwent total joint replacement, after obtaining informed and signed consent forms. Patients were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans of our research.

The upstream and downstream primer sequences for human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were 5\u2032-AAGGTCATCCCAGAGCTGAA -3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA -3\u2032, respectively. Immunohistochemistry Sections obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (a total of 6 samples from 6 different RA patients) were used for immunohistochemistry. Following deparaffinization and antigen retrieval in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0), the specimens were first incubated with primary antibodies (anti-ACE2, rabbit polyclonal, Bioss Antibodies Inc., Woburn, MA, USA), and then with the AP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The samples were then visualized using ImmPACT Vector Red Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), and the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin solution. Purification and culture of fibroblast like synoviocytes (FLS) To obtain FLS, synovial tissues from three different RA patients were minced and incubated with 1mg/ml collagenase/dispase (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, JAPAN) in PBS (pH7.2) for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. The tissue samples were then filtered, washed, and cultured. During the culture, the supernatant was replaced frequently to remove nonadherent cells. The FLS were cultured in DMEM (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka, JAPAN) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and penicillin/streptomycin (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation). Cultured cells at passages 3 through 6 were used for the experiments and were starved in DMEM with 0.5% FBS for > 6 hours before the addition of recombinant cytokines, human Interlukin-6 (IL-6) (100 ng/ml) and human IL-6R\u03b1 (100 ng/ml) (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA).
