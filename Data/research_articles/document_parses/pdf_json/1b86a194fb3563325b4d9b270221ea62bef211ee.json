Prostaglandin F 2\u03b1 synthase (PGF2S) has been observed in the Leishmania braziliensis secreted proteome and in L. donovani extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, we previously reported a positive correlation between L. braziliensis PGF2S (LbrPGF2S) expression and pathogenicity in mice.",

            "text": "The synthesis and functions of prostaglandins (PGs) are well characterized mainly in terms of mammalian physiology. In mammals, prostaglandin synthases catalyze the production of prostaglandins using arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites as substrates. AA is removed from membranes by the action of phospholipase A2 and converted into prostaglandin H2 (PGH 2 ) by cyclooxygenases (COX-1 or COX-2). PGH 2 is then converted into several metabolites, such as PGD 2 , PGE 2 and PGF 2\u03b1 , by prostaglandin synthases (e.g. PGF2S) [6] . In mammals, PGF 2\u03b1 is mostly related to ovulation, luteolysis, uterine contraction and the onset of labor [7] . However, it has been recently reported that PG production is not restricted to mammals, occurring in trypanosomatids [6] and other protozoan parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum [8] and Entamoeba histolytica [9] [10] . High levels of PGF 2\u03b1 have been detected in Trypanosoma brucei, catalyzed by TbPGF2S from PGH 2 [11] . The prostaglandin F 2\u03b1 synthase activity has been demonstrated for three trypanosomatids orthologous genes. Roberts and colleagues [12] have shown that, in spite of the lack of credible cyclooxygenases, these parasites use arachidonic acid as a substrate to produce PGF 2\u03b1 . Additionally, these and other authors demonstrated that some of these kinetoplastid aldo-keto reductases metabolize toxic ketoaldehydes, playing a role as detoxification agents and possibly acting in cellular defense [12, 13] . However, the importance of these pathways for parasite biology and host interaction remains under-explored.",

No significant changes in PGF2S abundance were observed from day 1 to day 8 (from log to stationary phase, enriched for procyclic and metacyclic forms, respectively), indicating that Lbr-PGF2S is constitutively expressed in promastigotes during in vitro growth (Fig. 2a) . We then analyzed the presence of LbrPGF2S in the supernatant of stationary promastigote culture (day 7 post-inoculum). Promastigotes were removed by centrifugation and supernatants filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm syringe filter, excluding parasites but not vesicles, such as exosomes. LbrPGF2S was detected by immunoblotting in both parasite lysates and culture supernatant (Fig. 2b) . Indirect immunofluorescence using anti-LbrPGF2S antibody revealed cytoplasmic distribution of LbrPGF2S with a noticeably stronger signal near the flagellar pocket (Fig. 2c) , a secretory organelle in trypanosomatids. To confirm that axenic L. braziliensis promastigotes produce PGF 2\u03b1 , the levels of PGF 2\u03b1 in the culture supernatant were quantified at growth days 3 and 7 using an immunoenzymatic assay. Prior to evaluation, the cells were kept at either 26 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C for 4 h in the presence or absence of arachidonic acid (AA). Under all the conditions tested, we observed an increment in PGF 2\u03b1 levels in the supernatant when AA was added. The effect was particularly evident in samples kept at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 2d) . Next, to investigate LbrPGF2S expression in amastigotes, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were used for in vitro infection with wild type (WT) L. braziliensis late-stationary phase promastigotes and transfectants overexpressing LbrPGF2S ectopically (Lb[pXLbrPGF2S] ).

Fluorescence of mChPGF2S was detected mainly inside intracellular promastigotes in the early stages of infection. Surprisingly, at ~18 h post-infection (pi), mChPGF2S was observed in the macrophage cytoplasm and subsequently found dispersed. Note that at this time the parasites had not fully differentiated into amastigotes, although most gene expression changes take place in this initial phase of differentiation [18] . This staining pattern was not observed in control Lb[mCherry] intracellular parasites (Fig. 4 , Additional file 4: Video S1, Additional file 5: Video S2, Additional file 6: Video S3, Additional file 7: Video S4).",

The protein might be secreted through the flagellar pocket, as indicated by the strong signal detected under immunofluorescence. These results corroborate and extend previous studies that have identified PGF2S in the secreted proteome of L. braziliensis [19] .",

Since we detected the production of PGF 2\u03b1 by promastigotes in axenic culture, we suggest that LbrPGF2S has the same catalytic function. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first, however, to observe that LbrPGF2S is expressed in amastigotes and localized in the host cell cytoplasm infected with Leishmania. Other authors have shown that vesicles released by Leishmania during in vitro or in vivo infection interfere with host cell response [20] . Recently, it has been shown that promastigotes secret exosomes into the midgut lumen of the sand fly vector and these extracellular vesicles are regurgitated with parasites into the skin during blood meal, modulating the immune response to Leishmania infection. Interestingly, the PGF2S protein was found among the 124 proteins identified by proteomic analysis in vesicles from L. infantum-infected midguts [21] . Although other experiments are needed to confirm LbrPGF2S secretion, our results are indicative of the transfer of the enzyme into the cytoplasm of infected macrophages. Other proteins secreted to the host cell cytoplasm, such as gp63, were shown to modulate phagocytic cell response [22, 23] . The process by which PGF2S reaches the cytoplasm of the host cell remains unknown, but we have shown that inhibition of the prostaglandin receptor affected negatively the infection profile of BMDM in vitro.",

In addition, AKR1C3 is abundant in keratinocytes in the suprabasal layer of the epidermis and regulates the synthesis of PGF 2\u03b1 in the presence of calcium, contributing to the pro-inflammatory response in vitro [27] . Although we have shown that LbrPGF2S and AKR1C3 protein sequences share 51.4% similarity and 34.3% identity, modelling using the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) PDB suggests that the protein structures of LbrPGF2S and AKR1C3 are quite similar, sharing at least two aldo/keto reductase domains and indicating that both proteins may retain the core function of PGF 2\u03b1 production. Thus, the work of other researchers using different Leishmania species [6, 14] and our own data suggest that the PGF 2\u03b1 signaling pathway could be involved in Leishmania pathogenicity. ",
