Patients with Treg frequency below the median had significantly higher nonrelapse mortality (largely attributable to GVHD) compared to patients with Treg frequency above the median 41% vs. 8%, P 5 0.03. This translated into inferior 2 year survival of 38% versus 63% (P 5 0.03). There was no difference in relapse mortality according to Treg frequency. This analysis shows that the frequency of CD4 1 CD25 hi FOXP3 1 Tregs at the onset of GVHD correlates with ultimate severity, nonrelapse mortality, and overall survival. It will be of interest to determine whether Tregs can predict the onset of GVHD and whether therapy can be targeted depending on the frequency of regulatory T cells identified at GVHD onset. This relatively simple and rapid flow cytometry assay may have important diagnostic and prognostic value in patients developing clinical findings consistent with graftversus-host disease after hematopoietic SCT. Abstract Summary GVHD affects 20-70% of allogeneic SCT recipients and can result in significant transplant-related morbidity and mortality due to tissue injury and opportunistic infections from intensive and chronic immunosuppressive therapy [5] [6] [7] . GVHD is initiated by both host and donor antigen presenting cells [including dendritic cells (DC)] and mediated by memory and effector T cells of donor origin. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of GVHD is needed and could lead to more effective preventative or therapeutic interventions and better outcomes from SCT.",

They evaluated serial peripheral blood samples from 32 patients after allogeneic SCT and 11 developed grade II-IV GVHD. The percentage of DC expressing either CCR5 or CCR7 was calculated and correlated with the development of acute GVHD. CCR7 expression showed no association with GVHD. In contrast, higher CCR5 expression was detected on DC in patients developing grade II-IV GVHD compared to DC in patients with grade 0-I GVHD (P < 0.0001). All 11 patients with grade II-IV GVHD expressed CCR5 in over 35% of their DCs while only 2 of 21 patients with grade 0-1 GVHD expressed CCR5 at this high a percentage. Most importantly, the expression of CCR5 on DC preceded the development of moderate to severe GVHD by a median of 19 days (range 2-47 days; samples drawn twice weekly). This is an exciting study which identifies a biologic marker which predicts for the development of GVHD; if verified, this could result in preventative modulation of immunosuppressive therapy for certain patients found to be at higher and lower risk for GVHD. In addition this study highlights a specific potential target for GVHD intervention (the CCR5 receptor), which has gained notoriety as the site of entry for HIV into lymphocytes. Other studies have suggested that CCR5 is important for development of GVHD [8, 9] . For this reason CCR5 antagonists such as maraviroc may be potential mediators of GVHD and should be studied in clinical trials.",

They used quantitative PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates to monitor for the most common RVs and found that 50% of patients had evidence of infection at a median of day 116 after transplant (range: 7-100).

Interestingly the development of acute GVHD was associated with a lower risk of an alloimmune lung syndrome (P 5 0.004), perhaps related to the protective effects of prolonged immunosuppression. Most striking was the finding that development of an alloimmune lung syndrome was the only predictor for mortality (P 5 0.04).

It is possible that these infections enhance local inflammation or changes that make the lung a target for allogeneic recognition. This is supported by the protective effects of acute graft vs. host disease perhaps related to the prolonged use of immunosuppression. This study is important for several reasons. The high incidence of respiratory virus infection (50%) is concerning in itself and may support the use of reverse isolation precautions so common in many transplant centers. This study suggests a possible mechanism of pulmonary toxicity after allogeneic transplant and should lead to further prospective studies for early monitoring, protection, and intervention of patients undergoing transplant. It would also be of interest to determine if early common RV infections occur with this frequency and are associated with pulmonary toxicity and adult patients undergoing HSCT.",

This, in combination with improvements in short-term treatment-related mortality rates has led to an increased prevalence of SCT recipients in the population who have unique long-term health care needs related to their survivorship. A potentially devastating long-term complication of SCT is the development of secondary malignancies [14] . Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia usually occur within the first 7 years after SCT [15] . The risk of developing solid tumors however continues to increase with time and patients are often no longer under the care of a transplant physician at the time of increased risk. Secondary solid tumors predominantly occur in the upper GI tract, oral cavity, brain, soft tissues and skin. A clear dose response has been found with the use of total body radiation and the incidence of solid tumors after SCT [16, 17] . In addition to increased risk from the direct cytotoxic effects of the conditioning regimen, chronic inflammation (as in the setting of GVHD), chronic immunosuppression (with increase risk of viral infection and decreased tumor surveillance) and increased genetic susceptibility may also play roles in the pathogenesis of these secondary tumors after allogeneic SCT [14, 17] .",

All subjects received chemotherapy only conditioning regimens with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. The median time of follow-up for survivors was 8.2 years; 47% of patients were alive and evaluable at 5 years after SCT and 18% were alive and evaluable at 10 years after SCT. Sixty-six solid cancers were reported; the cumulative incidence of solid tumors at 3, 5 and 10 years after SCT were 0.7, 0.9, and 2.0% for AML patients and 0.5, 1.1, and 3.4% for CML patients. These rates were higher than expected rates in the general population. . On Cox-regression analysis, risk factors for developing solid tumors included older age, chronic GVHD and use of peripheral blood (as opposed to bone marrow) as a stem cell source.",

The role of pretransplant consolidative chemotherapy may be different in the RIC-SCT setting than the myeloablative setting. One could hypothesize that with less intensive conditioning therapy, additional rounds of cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy before RIC-SCT would result in lower relapse rates by minimizing residual disease. Alternatively, RIC-SCT recipients tend to be older and sicker than myeloablative SCT recipients and increased rounds of therapy before SCT may contribute to more treatment-related mortality.",

This permits generation of T cells specific for multiple antigens and multiple epitopes. Antigens and epitopes would not be restricted to a specific HLA polymorphism as occurs when tumor-specific T cells are generated against only 1 specific peptide that is expressed in an HLA-restricted manner. Polyclonal T cell activation occurs by exposure to a potent cocktail of cytokines developed to promote generation of Th1 cells (IL12), inhibit expansion of Tregs (IL-6) and provide enhanced survival and proliferative signals (IL15). To target lymphoma, they combined three potential lymphoma associated antigens, SSX2, Survivin, and MAGEA4 and generated ''multi-tumor associated antigen cytotoxic T cells'' (multiTAA CTL) against all three antigens from six healthy donors. They showed that these cells had activity against autologous antigen pulsed targets and whole antigen expressing fibroblasts and were not reactive against control targets. Similarly to target myeloid leukemia they combined WT1, Prame, PR3, and Survivin and generated multispecific T cells against all antigens from two healthy donors.",

This technical advance is important since it permits generation of CTLs against multiple tumorassociated antigens and therefore may reduce the risk of tumor escape; it is likely that multiple antigens will need to be targeted for maximal efficacy. Furthermore, the ability to generate CTLs with multiple specificities markedly increases the efficiency of this approach and eliminates the need for specific polymorphic HLA-restriction.

The median age of patients was 50 (range 24-69) and 105 patients received a planned tandem autologous transplant followed by allogeneic SCT. With a median follow-up of 55 months (range 3-98) for all patients, and 25 months (range 3-76) for recipients of tandem autologous/allogeneic SCT, 3 year overall survival was quite reasonable at 45% (95% CI 33-58) for recipients of a single allogeneic SCT and 64% (53-75) for recipients of tandem autologous/allogeneic SCT. Treatment related mortality (TRM) at 3 years was 27 (17-38)% and 16 (10-25)% respectively and relapse rates were 48 (36-60)% and 41 (29-54)%. The 3 year progression free survival (PFS) was 25 (15-37)% and 42 (20-43)% demonstrating that long-term control was possible in some patients. The multivariate analysis showed that chronic GVHD decreased the probability of relapse (RR 0.43, P 5 0.012), though this effect was limited to patients without IgG myeloma for reasons that are difficult to explain. In addition, PFS was better with autologous 1 allogeneic HSCT compared to allogeneic SCT (RR 3.6, P 5 0.001), suggesting that dose intensive chemotherapy still has a major role in care of these patients. This report has many limitations. In particular it is a retrospective study and it is not known how patients were selected for specific therapies. Some findings are not easily explained, such as a benefit of chronic GVHD in terms of relapse noted only in patients without IgG myeloma. Nevertheless, it is a large study using available registry data demonstrating that at least in some patients, a GVM effect can be generated and long-term disease control achieved. Defining the proper patient population, timing of transplant, and the role for autologous/allogeneic SCT before RIC allogeneic SCT remain important subjects for future studies that hopefully will someday harness the GVM effect for maximal benefit.",

Although direct comparative data is limited, there is an expectation that this drug has significant activity and a favorable toxicity profile compared to other immunosuppressive therapies for GVHD. However, the pharmacokinetics have not been well defined in this setting. This analysis from Jacobson and colleagues for the BMT-CTN is important since it shows that obtaining therapeutic levels is important to optimize response rates for acute GVHD without resulting in increased risk of infection or limited survival at least by day 180. This should directly impact how transplant physicians use MMF. Further pharmacokinetic studies will be needed to define the optimal dose and schedule, but consideration should be given to either close drug monitoring and/or altering dosing from 2 to 3 g/day or body weight dosing. Primary pulmonary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (PPL) is a rare extranodal lymphoid neoplasm. The present knowledge of this entity is vague and minimal. A total of 29 patients diagnosed with PPL at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center in China were retrospectively analyzed. Nineteen patients had mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, nine had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and one had plasmacytic lymphoma. Six patients received PET/CT scans before treatment, and mean maximum standardized uptake values (mSUVs) were much higher in the DLBCL cases (n 5 3) than in the MALT lymphoma cases (n 5 3). The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 79.3%. Cox regression analysis showed that hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAP) was an independent predictor of survival (P 5 0.029). The mean survival time (MST) was 75.5 months for patients who underwent surgery and 65.7 months for those who didn't (P 5 0.38). The MST was 77.4 months for patients treated with rituximab and 54.1 months for those not treated with rituximab (P 5 0.101). Clinical characteristics in our study were partly similar to those previously reported. However, we found that hilar/mediastinal LAP seemed to be an effective prognostic factor in Chinese PPL patients. The role of surgery and rituximab in the management of PPL warrants further investigation. PPL is quite rare and it is defined as clonal lymphoid proliferation involving the lung parenchyma and/or bronchi but without extrathoracic extension at the time of diagnosis or within the subsequent 3 months [1, 2] . Patients diagnosed with PPL may present with hilar or mediastinal LAP, but most of the tumor burden is in the lung [1] . PPL represents only 0.4% of all lymphomas, and less than 1% of NHL [2] [3] [4] . The treatment for primary pulmonary lymphomas (whether surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy alone or in combination) has not been clearly established. The role of rituximab in the treatment of PPL remains controversial [5] .",

The clinical features of all patients are presented in Table I . Nineteen patients (65.5%) had MALT lymphoma, nine (31.0%) had DLBCL, and one (3.4%) had plasmacytic lymphoma. In most of the patients in this series, surgery provided a definite diagnosis, whereas bronchoscopic biopsy had a low-diagnostic yield. Of the 16 patients with PPL who underwent bronchoscopic examination, only four had positive results. Prior to treatment, all 29 patients were evaluated by CT scans, and six patients underwent integrated 18 F-FDG-PET/CT scanning. The radiological findings for all patients are listed in Table I . Twenty patients (69.0%) had unilateral lung involvement and nine (31.0%) had hilar/mediastinal LAP. Of the six patients who underwent integrated 18 F-FDG-PET/CT scanning, three had DLBCL and three had MALT lymphoma. The maximal standardized uptake values (mSUVs) ranged from 2.0 to 7.6 (mean mSUV, 3.9 \u00b1 1.72) in the three MALT lymphoma cases and from 10.5 to 16.9 (mean mSUV, 13.5 \u00b1 2.74) in the three DLBCL cases.",

PET scans may be able to reliably distinguish between indolent and aggressive subtypes in lymphoma patients. In our study, the mSUVs were much higher in DLBCL cases than MALT lymphoma cases. DLBCL in contrast to MALT lymphoma often shows aggressive growth, which may increase FDG uptake by the lesions.

However, different cell populations from patients who received various degrees of pretreatment were used for this analysis. Therefore, several biases in the results and their interpretation may arise. We investigated hOCT1 mRNA expression in different cell populations of peripheral blood (PB) from healthy volunteers and in imatinib na\u00efve de novo CML patients by analyzing changes in hOCT1 mRNA expression during the first 6 months of imatinib therapy. The hOCT1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in PB polymorphonuclears compared to mononuclears. The hOCT1 mRNA expression in total PB leukocytes is, therefore, preferentially determined by the percentage of polymorphonuclears. Expression in each analyzed group of cells was always significantly lower in imatinib na\u00efve de novo CML patients compared to healthy volunteers. This difference disappeared after the initiation of imatinib therapy, suggesting that CML tumor burden and the degree of pretreatment at the time of monitoring were both influencing factors. Imatinib (IMA) uptake is predominantly mediated by human organic cation transporter 1 (hOCT1) [1] . Decreased expression or function of this protein can lead to a reduction of the intracellular concentration of IMA and, there-fore, lead to pharmacokinetic resistance to the drug [1, 2] . There are several data suggesting a correlation between hOCT1 activity/expression and the therapeutic outcome of CML patients treated with IMA [3] [4] [5] . Unfortunately, this issue has several uncertainties in the literature that may lead to the misinterpretation of previously reported data and the interpretation of future studies. First, hOCT1 activity, which is measured by a functional assay [1, 2] , must be clearly differentiated from mRNA expression monitoring [1, [3] [4] [5] . Second, the cell populations used for analysis vary widely in cell type, especially in studies that monitor mRNA hOCT1 expression [1, [3] [4] [5] . Furthermore, while some studies have monitored a well-defined group of patients with de novo chronic phase CML [3] , others make analyses on heterogeneous study populations that contain pretreated patients [4, 5] .",

The large variability in the percentage of PMNC from total LEU in patients with IMA na\u00efve de novo CML (median: 75%; range: 33-93%) is, therefore, an important factor in the marked variability seen in hOCT1 mRNA expression in total LEU at the time of CML diagnosis.

The median hOCT1 mRNA expression level from total LEU was significantly lower in the CML patients at the time of diagnosis compared to median expression levels in healthy individuals ( Fig. 1 ; P < 0.001; nonparametric Mann Whitney test). However, after 1 month of IMA treatment, the median hOCT1 mRNA expression level in total LEU significantly increased (P 5 0.031; nonparametric Wilcoxon test) and reached the expression levels from healthy volunteers. Therefore, the previously described difference in expression level disappeared during this observation period (P 5 0.769; nonparametric Mann Whitney test) ( Fig.  2A) . The same finding of hOCT1 mRNA expression was seen in the MNC samples from patients under the same criteria ( Figs. 1 and 2B) . The lower hOCT1 mRNA expression level in LEU from IMA na\u00efve de novo CML patients compared to healthy volunteers as well as its progressive increase after the start of IMA therapy could be explained by the initial presence and subsequent gradual disappearance of tumor cells from the measured cell population. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed an analysis on the relationship of hOCT1 expression with the percentage of immature myeloid cells in the LEU samples (as a marker of disease burden) obtained from IMA na\u00efve de novo CML patients. In addition, because of the fact that a majority of patients did not have immature myeloid cells present in PB LEU samples after the first month of IMA therapy, we analyzed the dependence of LEU hOCT1 mRNA expression on the amount of BCR /ABL transcripts from these samples. We found a statistically significant relationship between hOCT1 mRNA expression level and the percentage of immature myeloid cells at the time of diagnosis as well as the BCR/ABL transcript level at the first month after the start of IMA treatment (Fig. 3A,B) .",

According to our findings, the increase in hOCT1 mRNA expression after the start of IMA treatment was not caused by the suppression of inhibitory effects of the BCR/ABL oncogene, as suggested by Bazeos et al., but rather was due to a significant effect of the lower hOCT1 mRNA expression in immature myeloid cells (mostly CML tumor cells), which rapidly disappeared from the PB within the first month of IMA therapy.",

However, the MNC is composed of several types of cells (including immature myeloid precursors, mostly tumor cells in CML patients). Although not analyzed, because of a low number of available samples for hOCT mRNA measurement in MNC (required for statistical significance), we expected that the impact of the cell composition found in total leukocytes on the hOCT mRNA expression results would be similar when measured in MNC. Therefore, it is not surprising that Labussiere et al. and White et al. did not dem- letters onstrate a relationship between hOCT1 expression measured in IMA na\u00efve de novo CML patients and the future therapeutic response [3, 9] . Although Wang et al. [5] was able to show this relationship, only 16 of the 70 CML patients from this study were not pretreated. Thus, it is unknown whether the high hOCT1 mRNA expression level seen in Wang et al. could be a real predictor of therapeutic response in the future, or whether patients with a high hOCT1 mRNA expression level had a differential leukocyte and mononuclear count (due to pretreatment) that was close to that of healthy individuals and therefore higher than other patients in the study. In addition, Wang et al. did not clearly define the cell population in which measurements was carried out, which creates additional uncertainty in their results. Similarly, Crossman et al. demonstrated a relationship between of hOCT1 mRNA expression and the achievement of a complete cytogenetic response [4] . However, all patients in that study were pretreated and this fact could explain why there was no observed difference between expression of hOCT1 mRNA in CML patients and healthy donors. Furthermore, Crossman et al. used bone marrow MNC for monitoring hOCT1 mRNA expression. The influence from the higher percentage of different myeloid precursors in these samples, as well as the greater heterogeneity in hOCT1 mRNA expression, is likely to exceed the influence of the immature cells in the PB samples that we have described in the present study.",

However, we have shown that this level corresponds to the current differential count of leukocytes and the quantity of tumor cells at the time of testing, rather than being a prognostic factor that correlates with the future therapeutic response of patients with CML. Although we did not assess enough patients in this study for unequivocal evidence, it can be assumed that an analogous situation exists in monitoring the hOCT1 mRNA expression level in PB mononuclear cells, as it is also a mixture of cells (although less heterogeneous than the total leukocytes) with different expression levels of hOCT1 mRNA. Finally, the question remains of whether or not the dependencies of hOCT1 mRNA expression in total leukocytes described in this study also apply to functional assays that analyze the activity of the hOCT1 transporter. It would be of great interest to perform analogous analyses to those in this study for monitoring the activity of the hOCT1 transporter. These data would be essential for the evaluation of all studies that assess the importance of this parameter as a marker of therapeutic response to IMA in de novo CML patients.",

Even though pain is considered an important determinant of QoL in sickle cell patients, factors such as organ damage and socioeconomic circumstances may also be important. Therefore, we determined the contribution of chronic organ damage and sickle cell-related complications to QoL and also analyzed the effect of vaso-occlusive crises and socioeconomic circumstances on QoL. Consecutive adult sickle cell patients were included. QoL was represented in a physical component scale (PCS) and a mental component scale (MCS) and assessed with SF-36 forms. Higher pain rates were related to lower QoL scores. Both occupation and the level of education were significantly related to PCS while no relation with MCS or pain rate was found. Thirty-five percent of the patients were unemployed when compared with 6% of the general population and 16% of immigrants without SCD. Neither genotype nor the presence of chronic organ damage were significantly related to QoL. In conclusion, a reduced QoL was mainly determined by pain rate, occupation, and educational level. Chronic organ damage, although a major factor determining life expectancy in SCD, was not a determinant of QoL.",

Interestingly, pain rate was only associated with a reduced MCS, whereas the social circumstances of the patients were related to the PCS. These data suggest that frequent painful and unpredictable crises are an important psychological burden rather than a physical burden to sickle cell patients as has been suggested previously [12] . In contrast, social circumstances as reflected by occupation and level of education were mainly related to the PCS, suggesting that only patients in good physical performance are able to finish school and find jobs independently of the frequency of admission for painful crises. This was further supported by the finding that no correlation between the MCS and PCS was found in the sickle cell population, which is in contrast to letters the findings of QoL assessments in healthy individuals [7] . Similar to previous findings of McClish et al. [10] , we did not find a correlation between genotype and QoL scores. Also, no difference in QoL scores was observed between patients on hydroxyurea and those who are not on hydroxyurea. This might be explained by the fact that in our study population, hydroxyurea was only prescribed to reduce painful crises and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome. By reducing these complications in patients with an otherwise more severe clinical presentation, hydroxyurea may have improved the QoL. This is in line with a previous prospective study of Ballas et al. [13] who demonstrated an improved QoL with the use hydroxyurea.",

Briefly, it yields eight different scales (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, social functioning, mental health, vitality, bodily pain, and general health perceptions) of functional health and well-being as well as psychometrically based physical and mental health summary measures. The SF-36 is a generic measure, which is not age, disease, or treatment specific. Accordingly, the SF-36 has proven to be useful in surveys of general and specific populations, comparing the relative burden of diseases [7] . All patients were asked to complete this questionnaire during a routine outpatient visit. All scale scores are linearly converted to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating higher levels of functioning or well-being. We analyzed the scores of our study population and compared the data with the scores of the general healthy Dutch population [7] .",

Although several reports suggest correlation of TP53 mutation with the type of chromosomal translocation in childhood B-precursor ALL, it has not been directly confirmed in a single cohort study due to the limited incidence of TP53 mutation in primary samples at diagnosis. Leukemia cell lines generally show higher incidence of gene mutations compared with primary samples. Thus, to clarify possible differences in cooperation of the p53 pathway for leukemogenesis with the type of chromosomal translocation, TP53 gene mutation was analyzed in 32 B-precursor ALL cell lines. TP53 mutation was observed in 40.6% (13 cell lines), and missense mutation of R248Q was the most commonly observed (5 cell lines). Of note, TP53 mutation was frequently observed among MLLrearranged and t(1;19)-positive ALL cell lines, but was very rare among Philadelphia chromosome-positive and t(17;19)-positive ALL cell lines. Although the number of samples analyzed is limited, this is the first direct observation of the correlation between the incidence of TP53 mutation and types of translocation in B-precursor ALLs, suggesting a functionally different fusion gene product in the p53 pathway for leukemogenesis.",

Of note, TP53 mutation is widely observed in various tumors including leukemia. An early retrospective study of exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene in 50 B-precursor ALL cases demonstrated that only one case (2%) had mutation [2] , and a large retrospective study of 264 childhood B-precursor ALL cases at diagnosis demonstrated that only five cases (1.9%) had TP53 mutation in exons 5-8, which encode highly conserved regions during evolution [3] . The incidence of TP53 mutation in exons 4-9 among poor-outcome childhood ALL cases at diagnosis was 30% (3/10 cases) [4] . Later studies reported that TP53 mutation might be relatively frequent among ALL with MLL-rearrangement and t(1;19): the inci-dence of TP53 mutation in exons 5-9 in MLL-rearranged ALL at diagnosis was 23% (3/13 cases) [5] , and that in exons 2-11 in t(1;19)-ALL at diagnosis was 10% (2/20 cases) [6] . In contrast, TP53 mutation was rare in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive ALL: none of 15 Ph1-positive ALL cases at diagnosis had TP53 mutation in exons 2-11 [7] . Although these reports suggest correlation of TP53 mutation with the type of chromosomal translocation in childhood B-precursor ALL, it has not been directly confirmed in a single cohort study due to the limited incidence of TP53 mutation in primary samples at diagnosis. Leukemia cell lines are usually established from leukemia in progressed disease status, and, thus, generally show higher incidence of gene mutations compared with primary samples [8] . In fact, Kawamura et al. [6] reported that the incidence of TP53 mutation was increased to 80% (4/5 cell lines) among t(1;19)-ALL cell lines, suggesting that the incidence of TP53 mutation might be augmented in cell lines. Accordingly, ALL cell lines would be useful tools to confirm the correlation of TP53 mutation with chromosomal translocations.",

The distribution of the 16 mutations identified in 13 cell lines is shown in Fig. 1A and compared with that in previous reports on B-precursor ALL samples [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and T-ALL samples [18, 19] . Five (38.5%) of the 13 cell lines with TP53 mutation had missense mutation of c.743 G>A resulting in p.R248Q, and 2 cell lines (15.4%) had missense mutation of c.817C>T resulting in p.R273C; both are well known as hotspots. Among the 16 mutations, 11 mutations were located in highly con-served regions. This pattern of distribution was similar to that in B-precursor ALL samples previously reported, in which 5 (18.5%) of the 27 samples with TP53 mutation had R248Q.

Of note, consistent with the series of clinical samples in previous reports [5] [6] [7] , the incidence of TP53 mutation among MLL-rearranged and t(1;19)-positive ALL cell lines was significantly higher than that among the other ALL cell lines including Ph1 and t(17;19)-positive ALL cell lines (P < 0.05, chi-squared test). Although the number of cell lines analyzed is limited, this is the first direct observation in a single analysis of the correlation between the incidence of TP53 mutation and types of translocation in B-precursor ALLs. The incidence of TP53 mutation among MLL-rearranged and t(1;19)-positive ALL cell lines observed in this study was higher than that in previous reports using clinical samples, suggesting that TP53 mutation plays a role in disease progression and/or the in vitro proliferative activity of MLL-rearranged and t(1;19)-positive ALL but not necessarily Ph1 and t(17;19)-positive ALL. It should be noted that E2A-HLF chimera derived from t (17;19) has the potential to protect cells from apoptosis induced by activation of the p53 pathway [20] , suggesting that E2A-HLF might overcome at least the proapoptotic activity of p53. Similarly, it was reported that BCR-ABL blocks apoptotic cell death induced by DNA damage without altering p53-dependent G1 arrest [21] . Thus, E2A-HLF and BCR-ABL may have the potential to overcome the pro-apoptotic activity of p53 and, thus, TP53 mutation is not necessary for disease progression. In other words, regardless of the TP53 gene status, Ph1-positive ALL and t(17;19)-ALL could be relatively resistant to therapeutic modalities that activate the p53 pathway such as irradiation. In contrast, without TP53 mutation, MLL-rearranged ALL and t(1;19)-ALL might be relatively sensitive to therapeutic modalities that activate the p53 pathway, and, thus, TP53 mutation could be one of the prognostic factors for therapeutic outcome in these leukemias.",

TP53 mutation might be associated with the functional significance of the fusion gene product derived from translocation in the p53 pathway. (KOPN-30bi, 257bi, 266bi, 272bi, YAMN-73, 283bi, and 291) , 4 t(17;19)-ALL cell lines [11] (UOC-B1, HAL01 [14] , YCUB-2 [15] , Endo-kun), and 5 other ALL cell lines including 1 with t(12;21) (Reh) [16] and 4 with others (Nalm6, KOPN-32 [13] , 235 [13] , and 261 [17] ). Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), reverse transcription was performed using random hexamer (Amersham Bioscience, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and then incubated with RNase (Invitrogen). The state of the TP53 gene was tested by the yeast functional assay [12] as described previously [22, 23] . In brief, RT-PCR amplified TP53 cDNAs were cotransfected with a linealized gap vector carrying the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the gene into the yIG397 strain containing an integrated plasmid with the ADE2 open reading frame under the control of TP53-responsive promoter. Yeast containing the mutant TP53 cDNA fails to transcribe ADE mRNA and formed red colonies, whereas yeast expressing the wild-type TP53 forms white colonies. Thus, the status of the TP53 gene is quantitatively analyzed by the color of colonies. When functional assay demonstrated the TP53 mutation, sequences of We describe here the clinical manifestations of 37 patients with combined coagulation factor (F) V and FVIII deficiency, which is the commonest multiple coagulation factor deficiency state. Only a few cases are reported in the literature from India. Prolonged bleed post injury/ surgery (62%) is the commonest manifestation in our series, and epistaxis (19%) is rare in our patients in comparison to other series described in the literature. Although the frequency of bleeding manifestations differs among various reports, there is no evidence for increased bleeding manifestation due to combined deficiency of two coagulation factors as against a single coagulation factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series of this disorder described so far. Combined Factor (F) V and VIII is the commonest combined hereditary coagulation factor deficiency with a prevalence of 1:1,000,000 [1] . It is an autosomal recessive disorder of blood coagulation [2] and the frequency of such autosomal recessive disorders increases 8-10-folds in populations where consanguinity is common. It is caused by a defect in lectin mannose binding protein 1 (LMAN 1) gene or in multiple coagulation factor deficiency (MCFD) gene 2 [3] [4] [5] . It was initially described by Oeri et al. [6] in 1954 and so far about 150 patients have been described from around the world [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The largest of these studies so far, describe the clinical manifestations of this disorder in 27 patients of Iranian origin [7] . Patients who are homozygous for this combined factor deficiency state maintain a factor level between 4% and 30% [12, 13] . We present herewith the clinical and phenotypic data of combined FV and FVIII deficiency in a large series of 37 patients of Indian origin seen at our center.",

Prolonged bleeding post trauma/surgical procedure was the most frequent (62%) symptom in our patients. Our data shows that the pattern of bleeding among patients with combined FV and FVIII deficiency in India is different from that reported from Iran and Israel, even though the mean factor levels are similar.

There is a need for careful documentation of clinical data from different population to see what the profile is for large number of patients and whether there are any ethnic differences. Further molecular studies to identify the causative mutations in patients with this disease will shed light on the basis for the clinical diversity seen among the patients. We studied CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Tumor cells stained positive for CD1d in 21/44 cHL cases, whereas in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), only 9/31 stained positive. In contrast, CD1c expression was more common in NHL. The percentage of iNKT cells in cHL cell suspensions was similar to the percentage in reactive lymph nodes and was not related to the CD1d expression status of the tumor cells. In conclusion, we found expression of CD1d in HRS cells in half of the cHL cases, and also observed a substantial population of iNKT cells in cHL cell suspensions. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a B-cell neoplasm characterized by a minority of neoplastic cells, the Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, which are located within an extensive infiltrate of reactive cells, such as T cells, B cells, plasma cells, stromal cells, eosinophils, and macrophages. The HRS cells shape their microenvironment by attracting specific favorable T cell subsets, like regulatory T (Treg) and T helper 2 (TH-2) cells and producing factors such as CC-chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17 or TARC), transforming growth factor (TGF)-b and interleukin (IL)-10 [1] . Additionally, HLA class I is downregulated in HRS cells in 65% of the cHL cases and HLA class II in 40%, possibly as a strategy to escape from an effective immune surveillance [2] . All together, these factors may suppress the development of an effective antitumor response and provide a microenvironment that is favorable for the HRS cells.",

            "text": "Recent studies have suggested that T cells restricted to nonclassical MHC class I-like CD1 molecules may be involved in immune surveillance of hematological malignancies [3] [4] [5] [6] . CD1 molecules are nonclassical MHC class I-like molecules that present lipid antigens to T cells, triggering a specific immune response. Of the five CD1 isoforms (CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e) expressed in human tissue, only CD1c and CD1d are expressed in B cells [7] . The T cell receptors (TCRs) of T cells that recognize CD1c are indistinguishable from those that recognize MHC class I or II complexes. Most CD1c-restricted T cells appear to be TH-1-like cells that provide adaptive immunity to microbial-lipid antigens [8] . In contrast, CD1d presents lipid antigens to natural killer T (NKT) cells. The best characterized CD1d-restricted NKT cells in humans are the invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, also known as type I NKT cells. These cells are characterized by the expression of an invariant Va24Ja18 chain paired to a semi-invariant Vb11 chain [9] . Two distinct functional subsets of human iNKT cells are recognized in terms of cytokines production and cytotoxic activation. CD42 iNKT cells are more likely to be cytotoxic and produce TH-1 type cytokines, whereas CD41 iNKT cells are more likely to produce both TH-1 and TH-2 type cytokines after stimulation [10] . Several studies have shown the impor-tance of iNKT cells in B cell malignancies [4] [5] [6] . In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), CD1d1 tumor cells loaded with aGalCer can activate iNKT cells and in turn induce cell death of tumor cells [4] . Malignant multiple myeloma is characterized by a reversible functional defect in iNKT cells in comparison with nonprogressive myeloma and premalignant myeloma [5] . Furthermore, iNKT cells were shown to induce effective antilymphoma responses and were essential for the survival of mice in murine lymphoma models [6] . The role of iNKT cells in the immune surveillance in cHL is unknown. Here, we examined the expression of CD1c and CD1d in HRS cells and tumor infiltrating cells in 44 cHL cases, as well as in four cHL cell lines. Furthermore, we studied the presence of iNKT cells in cell suspensions of 10 cHL cases.",

In tonsil tissue, CD1c stained positive in the mantle zone (MZ) and predominantly negative in the germinal centers (GC) of secondary lymphoid follicles (Fig. 1A) consistent with the previously reported expression pattern [11] . HRS cells in cHL were consistently CD1c negative in all cases (Fig. 1B) , whereas 14 out of 39 non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) were positive (Table I) . The absence of CD1c expression in both GC B cells and HRS cells is consistent with the current assumption that HRS cells are derived from GC B cells [12] . CD1c expression has been reported in some other B-cell NHL subtypes, including GC B cell derived follicular lymphoma [11] . In B-cell NHL, an inverse correlation was noticed between CD1c and the proliferative activity assessed by expression of Ki-67 [11] . This is in line with the lack of CD1c staining in GC B cells that show a high proliferation index and high CD1c expression in the MZ B cells that are in a resting state. Ki-67 was shown to be highly expressed in HRS cells [13] correlating with the lack of CD1c expression. CD1c expression was found in reactive cells in all cases with a percentage varying from a few to the vast majority, similar to the CD1c expression pattern observed in interfollicular regions of tonsil tissue.",

By flowcytometry, we validated that CD1d was present on the membrane in cHL cell lines (data not shown). In normal tonsil tissue, CD1d staining was observed mainly in the MZ and showed no positive staining in the GC (Fig. 1G ) consistent with the reported results [14] . CD1d was detected in HRS cells in 21 out of 44 cHL cases (48%) (Fig. 1H , Table I,  Supporting Information Table I) , showing both cytoplasmic and membranous staining. No correlation was found with EBV status and CD1d expression (Table I) . CD1d was also positive in the reactive background, usually in more than half of the reactive cells. Nine of the 39 NHL cases were positive for CD1d (23% , Table I ), i.e., in three out of 19 GC B cell derived NHL and in six out of 20 non-GC B cell NHL (Table I, Supporting Information Table I ). The CD1d expression in HL is remarkable since GC B cells and the majority of the GC B cell derived NHL are negative. Positivity of HRS cells indicates that these cells might have acquired CD1d expression during malignant transformation. CD1d expression has been detected in some B cell malignancies, such as CLL [4] and multiple myeloma [5] . In these B cell malignancies, iNKT cells activated by a-GalCer loaded CD1d1 tumor cells resulted in the induction of apoptosis of the tumor cells in vitro [4, 5] .",

The mean percentage of iNKT cells was 4% (range 0.8-8%) in cHL and 4% (range 0.4-7%) in RLN (Table II) . iNKT cells were present at similar percentage in either CD1d positive or CD1d negative cHL cases. Two distinct iNKT subsets have been distinguished as Th1 type (CD4 2 iNKT) and Th2 type (CD4 1 iNKT) in terms of cytokine production and cytotoxic activation [10] . We observed a similar percentage of CD41 iNKT cells, i.e., around 50%, in cHL and RLN (Table II) . Given the high expression of CCL17 in HRS cells of cHL [15] and the high expression of the CCL17 receptor, CCR4, on CD41 iNKT cells [16] , it might be speculated that especially the CD41 iNKT cells are present in the close vicinity of HRS cells and might favor the survival and growth of HRS cells. Since it is known that the rosetting CD41CD262 T cells in HL have several features of anergy [17] , the CD1d-restricted iNKT cells might also be dysfunctional or anergic favoring HRS cells survival by escaping from an effective immunosurveillance in cHL. Taken together, we showed expression of CD1d in HRS cells of cHL cell lines and a significant proportion of cHL cases as well as the presence of a marked population of iNKT cells in the reactive background of cHL. The CD1d-iNKT cell axis might play a role in the disturbed immunoregulation in cHL.",

The exact prevalence of REL, BCL11A, and MYCN gains at the time of CLL diagnosis is currently unknown in consecutive series of the disease.
