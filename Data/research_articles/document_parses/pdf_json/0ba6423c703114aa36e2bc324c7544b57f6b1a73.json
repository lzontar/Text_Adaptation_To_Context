These were circulated to the Governors of the Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Surgeons of Asia (ELSA) for expert comments and discussion. The results of these were compiled and are presented in this paper. Results The recommendations include guidance for selection and screening of patients in times of active community spread, limited community spread, during times of sporadic cases or recovery and the transition between phases. Personal protective equipment requirements are also reviewed for each phase as minimum requirements. Capability management for the re-opening of services is also discussed. The choice between open and laparoscopic surgery is patient based, and the relative advantages of laparoscopic surgery with regard to complications, and respiratory recovery after major surgery has to be weighed against the lack of safety data for laparoscopic surgery in COVID-19 positive patients. We provide recommendations on the operating room set up and conduct of general surgery. If laparoscopic surgery is to be performed, we describe circuit modifications to assist in reducing plume generation and aerosolization. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic requires every surgical unit to have clear guidelines to ensure both patient and staff safety. These guidelines may assist in providing guidance to units developing their own protocols. A judicious approach must be adopted as surgical units look to re-open services as the pandemic evolves.",

Countries like China have seen an early surge followed by a sustained recovery, while others in Asia, like Singapore, after controlling the curve are now seeing surging numbers. There remain concerns about middle income Asian countries with limited screening and containment resources, resulting in a poor understanding of the extent of disease. This could result in the hypothetical but real concern of not only a resurgence over time but also that these countries could become reservoirs of ongoing infection. There are diverse economic conditions in Asia. Affluent countries seem to be able to absorb the financial shock of diverting resources to testing and treating COVID-19 patients, while putting most of the elective or non-emergency care on hold. Other Asian countries are having difficulty diverting resources from standard care and may be unable to hold back the provision of much need emergency and elective surgical care for long. The COVID-19 pandemic across Asia has interrupted the delivery of not only elective surgical care, but also has had a distinct impact on the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS). MIS has benefits of early recovery, shorter length of stay and equitable cost in certain scenarios and these value-adds have promulgated to wider adaptation of MIS across Asia. The general approach of reducing or stopping elective surgery to support emergency care and fulfill the needs of COVID-19 patients is very reasonable where there is wide community spread with limited system capacity. However, we should bear in mind that across Asia, many surgical institutions may not be called upon to support the COVID-19 efforts due to centralization of tertiary care. These surgical institutions may want to continue some level of non-emergent surgical care when there is limited community spread. There is a need during this COVID-19 pandemic for a surgical practice guideline in Asia that could be tailored to the needs of specific countries and their communities depending on the spread of COVID-19 and their local resources.",

Finally, all surgical services can revert to normal with the advent of a vaccine or effective therapy. This phased approach allows for a cautious introduction of surgical services while keeping health care workers safe, surgical disease, and COVID-19 at check. It will safe guard patient needs and prevent huge backlogs that would overwhelm the health care systems in Asia and may potentially result in unwanted outcomes in the form of morbidity to mortality.",

Aerosolization during laparoscopy is held as the most common reason for holding back laparoscopic surgery during COVID-19 outbreak. However, surgical plume results from tissue desiccation and thus the use of an electrocautery even in open surgery is potentially hazardous. Studies have shown that activated virus like, HIV and Papilloma virus can be found in surgical smoke that is blown away by the CO2 in laparoscopy and thus potentially infective [5, 6] . Also, hepatitis B virus has previously been demonstrated to be present in surgical smoke from HBV positive patients [7] . Erring on the side of caution, due to limited data on the use of laparoscopy in COVID-19 patients, many societies have cautioned against the use of laparoscopy [8, 9] . Li et al. in their study had shown that for the same energy device activated for 10 min during traditional open surgery versus laparoscopic surgery, the particle concentration of the smoke in laparoscopic surgery was significantly higher owing to low gas mobility in the pneumoperitoneum [10, 11] . It is also known that the low temperature aerosol arising from ultrasonic scalpels cannot effectively deactivate the cellular components of a virus. Another matter of concern is that the virus may concentrate in the gastrointestinal tract and surgical plume can thus be a source of infection even though the respiratory system is sealed by a closed and filtered respiratory circuit [12] . Mitigation strategies for aerosol formation and handling will be detailed in the recommendations below.",

Operating after hours should be avoided and the most appropriate skilled person as chosen by the team lead should perform the surgery 3. Limit the number of staff in the operating room to minimize exposure 4. Intubate and extubate within the operating room itself 5. Allow for a 5-min pause during intubation and extubation, with only the anesthetists and assistants, donning full PPE, to be in the operating room. This ensures that at least two full gas exchanges of the OR are taken and enhances safety in the very unlikely chance that the surgeons are operating on an undiagnosed COVID-19 case [13] 6. Trainee's participation in surgery is best not done as an operating surgeon given that it will delay surgery and may potentially risk complications and safety issues may arise [11] 7. The operating rooms ideally should be one as descried by Ti et al. [14] . An OR with a negative pressure environment located at a corner of the operating complex, and with a separate access, is designated for all confirmed (or suspected) COVID-19 cases. Only the ante room and anesthesia induction rooms have negative atmospheric pressures. But for countries with limited resources, an alternate OR complexes separated from the main OR can be identified for COVID-19 patients, thus avoiding contamination of other ORs. 8. Judicious use of PPE which includes a N-95 mask for high risk cases, impervious gown, double gloves, shields or goggles are recommended along with nonperforated shoes or rubber boots [15] . 9. No definitive evidence that PAPR reduces likelihood of viral transmission for potential airborne infections [16] . 10. Use regional anesthesia where possible to reduce intubation and general anesthesia related risk 11. Effective communication between the operating team, anesthetist and support staff is of paramount in helping to reduce operating time and improving safety. 12. Surgical plume needs to be removed effectively. During open surgery consider use of electrocautery pencil with suction. 13. Team changes will be required for prolonged procedures in full PPE [17] . 14. Adequate disposable of waste at the end of surgery. 15. During shifting of suspected COVID-19 patient to an outside recovery area or intensive care unit, handing over to a minimum number of transport personnel who are waiting outside the OR should be considered [18] . 16 . Personal protective equipment during transport should be not be the same as worn during the procedure [18] . 17. Continued education on the occupation hazard and updates on new research will help real time adjustment of protocols.",

Where a commercially available system can't be obtained due to cost or licensing issues a DIY technique that uses a draining tube connected to a ventilating port on the abdominal side and then to an underwater seal containing a virucidal solution like CIDEX\u00ae that connects to suction device can be used. d. Standard electrostatic filters used for ventilation offer 99.99% effective protection against HBV and HCV which have a diameter of 42 nm and 30-60 nm, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 has a larger diameter of 70-90 nm therefore according to an accepted publication of Mintz et al. [19] the filter can be connected via standard tubing to the trocar evacuation port to constitute an evacuation and filtering system which evacuates the generated smoke, as well as filters the potential viral load to ensure surgical staff safety without the need for active suction.",
