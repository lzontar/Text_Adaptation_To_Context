Here, we used thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase sequencing (TGIRT-seq) combined with peak calling to simultaneously profile all RNA biotypes in apheresis-prepared human plasma pooled from healthy individuals. Extending previous TGIRT-seq analysis, we found that human plasma contains largely fragmented mRNAs from >19,000 protein-coding genes, abundant full-length, mature tRNAs and other structured small non-coding RNAs, and less abundant tRNA fragments and mature and pre-miRNAs. Many of the mRNA fragments identified by peak calling correspond to annotated protein-binding sites and/or have stable predicted secondary structures that could afford protection from plasma nucleases. Peak calling also identified novel repeat RNAs, miRNA-sized RNAs, and putatively structured intron RNAs of potential biological, evolutionary, and biomarker significance, including a family of full-length excised introns RNAs, subsets of which correspond to mirtron pre-miRNAs or agotrons.",

Additionally, almost all RNA-seq studies of plasma RNAs have used retroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs) to convert RNAs into cDNAs for sequencing on highthroughput DNA sequencing platforms. Retroviral RTs have inherently low fidelity and processivity and even those that are highly engineered have difficulty reverse transcribing through stable RNA secondary structures or post-transcriptional modifications, resulting in under-representation of 5'-RNA sequences and aborted reads that can be mistaken for RNA fragments (24) . Thus, we still have an incomplete understanding of the biology of plasma RNAs and how to optimize their identification as biomarkers for human diseases.",

In addition to high fidelity, processivity, and strand-displacement activity, group II intron RTs have a proficient template-switching activity that enables efficient, seamless attachment of RNA-seq adapter sequences to target RNAs without RNA tailing or ligation (25, 26) . Further, unlike retroviral RTs, which tend to dissociate from RNAs at post-transcriptional modifications that affect base pairing, TGIRT enzymes pause at such modifications but eventually read through by characteristic patterns of mis-incorporation that can be used to identify the modification (20, 24, (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) . This combination of activities enables TGIRT enzymes to give relatively uniform 5'-and 3'-sequence coverage of mRNAs when initiating conventionally from an annealed oligo(dT) primer (25) and to give full-length, end-to-end reads of tRNAs and other structured small ncRNAs, when initiating by template switching to the 3' end of the RNA (20, 24, 25, 27) . In size selected RNA preparations, TGIRT-seq also profiles human miRNAs with bias equal to or less than alternative methods (25, 32) .",

In a validation study using rRNA-depleted chemically fragmented human reference RNAs with External RNA Control Consortium spike-ins, TGIRT-seq gave better quantitation of mRNAs and spike ins, more uniform 5' to 3' coverage of mRNA sequences, detected more splice junctions, particularly near the 5' ends of mRNAs, and had higher strand specificity when compared to benchmark TruSeq-v3 datasets (24) . This study also showed that TGIRT-seq enables simultaneous sequencing of chemically fragmented mRNAs together with tRNAs and other structured sncRNAs, which were poorly represented in the TruSeq datasets, even after chemical fragmentation (24) . A subsequent study of chemically fragmented human cellular RNAs with customized spike ins confirmed these findings and showed that TGIRT-seq enables simultaneous quantitative profiling of mRNA fragments and sncRNAs of >60 nt, but under-represents smaller RNAs due in part to differential loss during library clean-up to remove adapter dimers (33) . Recent TGIRT-seq profiling of structured RNAs in unfragmented cellular RNA preparations from human cells revealed previously unannotated sncRNAs, including novel snoRNAs, tRNA-like RNAs, and tRNA fragments (tRFs) (34) .",

Similarly, TGIRT-seq showed that highly purified EVs and exosomes secreted by cultured human cells also contained predominantly full-length tRNAs, Y RNAs, and Vault RNAs, together with low concentrations of mRNAs, including 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (5' TOP) mRNAs (30) . The same TGIRT-seq workflow using template switching for facile 3'-RNA-seq adapter enabled single-stranded (ss) DNA-seq profiling of human plasma DNA, including analyses of nucleosome positioning and DNA methylation sites that inform tissue-of-origin (35) , as shown previously for other ssDNA-seq methods (36, 37) .",

Additionally, we compared the fragmented mRNAs detected in plasma by TGIRT-seq with the polyadenylated mRNAs detected in the same plasma by ultra-low input SMART-Seq v4 and introduced the use of a peak-calling algorithm for analyzing TGIRT-seq datasets. We thus identified numerous mRNA fragments corresponding to annotated binding sites for ~100 different RNA-binding proteins. We also identified a wide variety of discrete structured RNAs and RNA fragments, including abundant repeat and transposable element RNAs, unannotated miRNA-sized RNAs, a family of putatively structured full-length, excised intron RNAs, some corresponding to mirtron pre-miRNAs and/or agotrons, and putatively structured intron RNA fragments, including a family corresponding to conserved structured segments of retrotransposed mRNAs that inserted within long introns.",

First, the initial TGIRT-template switching reaction was done at a lower salt concentration (200 instead of 450 mM) that increases the efficiency of 3'-RNA-seq adapter addition (26, 35) . Second, we used a modified R2R adapter that substantially decreases adapterdimer formation (32) , thereby improving the representation of very small RNAs, such as miRNAs and short tRNA fragments (tRFs). Finally, we used a modified R1R adapter with a 6-nt UMI to deconvolute duplicate reads (35) . The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument to obtain 10 to 27 million 75-nt paired-end reads, which were mapped to the hg19 human genome reference sequence. Mapping rates for the DNase-treated plasma RNA datasets (n=15) ranged from 82-96% (Supplementary File), with pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficients r = 0.67-1.00 (Fig. S2) . Although, we were concerned that the lower salt concentration used for template switching might increase the frequency of multiple sequential template switches, the percentages of soft-clipped and fusion/discordant read pairs, which include reads from multiple template switches, were relatively low (1.5-2.5% and 0.5-4.1%, respectively; Supplementary File).",

The plasma preparations also contained lower concentrations of specific cellular 5'-tRNA halves (0.02-68 CPM), 3'-tRNA halves (0.02-9,036 CPM), and shorter tRNA fragments (5'-tRFs, 0.02-39 CPM; 3'-tRFs, 3-640 CPM; and internal 2-tRFs, 0.02-7 CPM), with the proportion of reads corresponding to some 5'-tRNA halves and 5'-tRFs increasing after 3'phosphate removal (e.g., 5' half Gly-CCC, 2.9-fold increase; 5'-tRF Cys-GCA, 2-fold increase; see Supplementary File). Notably, TGIRT-seq identified 5' ends of 3'-tRFs that extend beyond the m 1 A modification site in the T\u03c8C loop, which is a strong stop for retroviral RTs and can be mistaken for the 5' end of 3'-tRFs ( Fig. S3) (39, 40) . Other structured sncRNAs in plasma, including Vault RNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs, 7SK RNA, 7SL RNA, 5S rRNA and 5.8S rRNA, were also present largely as full-length mature transcripts (Fig. S5 ), in agreement with previous findings (20) .",

Kraken2 assigns reads to bacterial, viral, and archaeal genomes based on matches to unique k-mer sequences in a database of non-redundant bacterial, viral, and archaeal sequences compiled from Refseq. We thus identified 2.83 million RNA reads assigned to bacteria, with the most abundant phyla being Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes and the most abundant genera being Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Acinetobacter, Halomonas, and Bacillus, consistent with other studies (41, 42) . A much smaller number of non-human RNA reads (~52,000) were assigned to viruses, the most abundant being Parvoviridae and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, a retrovirus (Fig. S7A ). The combined NaOH-treated plasma DNA datasets (n=4; 46 million deduplicated reads) contained only 12,000 non-human reads, much lower than 1% reported in another study using plasma prepared by a different method (43) . Most (93.3%) of the non-human DNA reads were assigned by Kraken2 to bacteria, mostly Pseudomonas spp., with only 64 reads assigned to viruses, mostly human \u03b2 herpesvirus 6B ( Fig. S7B and Supplementary File). The commercial plasma preparations had been screened by the supplier for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV-1, HIV-2, and syphilis, and we found no reads mapping to any of these pathogens.",

In the commercial plasma from multiple healthy individuals prepared by apheresis, the proportion of the TGIRT-seq reads mapping to protein-coding genes was relatively low (0.6-4.1%; Fig. 1C , lanes 4-6), but nevertheless sufficient to the identify mRNAs originating from 15,000-19,000 different protein-coding genes, with the highest number of different mRNAs detected after 3' phosphate removal with T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Fig. S8A and B) . The identities and relative abundances of different protein-coding gene transcripts in plasma pooled for multiple healthy individuals were similar to those in the previous TGIRT analysis using plasma RNA from a single healthy male individual (20) (r = 0.61-0.80; Fig. S8C ).",

The latter is a highly sensitive method for profiling polyadenylated mRNAs in which an engineered retroviral RT (SMARTScribe) initiates cDNA synthesis from an anchored oligo(dT) primer with an appended PCR primerbinding site and then template switches from the 5' end of that mRNA to an acceptor oligonucleotide containing a second primer-binding site, enabling PCR amplification of the resulting cDNAs. In our experiments, the resulting dsDNAs were fragmented by Covaris sonication and used to prepare DNA-seq libraries by using an NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep (New England Biolabs). The SMART-seq libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 to obtain 2.7-4.7 million 2 x 75 nt reads that mapped to >16,000 protein-coding genes with a transcript per million value (TPM) >0.1. Unlike TGIRT-seq, ultra-low input SMART-Seq does not preserve RNA strand information nor does it use an UMI to deconvolute duplicate reads. Bioanalyzer traces showed that the amplified dsDNAs obtained by SMART-Seq prior to Covaris sonication were substantially shorter than those from the cellular RNA control provided with the kit (peaks at 100-200 and 400-700 nt for plasma RNA compared to 700-7,000 nt for the cellular control RNA; Fig. 2A ), indicating that the poly(A)-containing mRNAs detected in plasma by SMART-Seq are enriched in 3' fragments.",

Similar correspondences were found for TGIRT-seq of plasma RNAs after 3'-phosphate removal (n=3; r=0.58) or after additional chemical fragmentation followed by 3'-phosphate removal (n=4; r=0.68; Fig. S8D and E). Heat maps comparing protein-coding gene transcripts detected by TGIRT-seq and SMART-Seq to primary tissue and platelet transcriptome data (44) (45) (46) indicated that the detected mRNA originated largely from hematopoietic tissues, including bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen, with contributions from erythrocytes, white blood cells, and platelets (Fig. S8F ), in agreement with other studies (10, 14) . The highly represented mRNAs detected by both TGIRT-seq and SMART-Seq included hemoglobins and other blood cell mRNAs (e.g., pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP) and S100 calcium-binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9), which are involved in regulating immune responses (47) (Fig. 2B and heat maps aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) mRNAs, which have potential intercellular signaling associated with different protein isoforms generated by alternative splicing (49) (Fig. 2B ).

This reflects that many of the additional protein-coding gene transcripts detected after 3'-phosphate removal had relatively low read counts and that the abundance of only a small proportion of protein-coding gene transcripts increased significantly after this treatment (0.41% by differential expression analysis using DESeq2; adjusted p-value < 0.01). Because 3' phosphates inhibit RNA-seq adapter addition by TGIRT template switching (25) , these findings are consistent with the suggestion from the previous TGIRT-seq analysis (20) that many mRNA fragments in plasma have 3' OH termini, as expected for RNA fragments generated by cellular ribonucleases that function in mRNA processing or turnover (50, 51) .",

To test this idea, we combined the TGIRT-seq datasets for all DNase-treated plasma samples (n=15) and removed reads from human blacklist regions, which are known to produce artifactual peaks (53) , as well as reads corresponding to rRNAs, Mt RNAs, and annotated sncRNAs, which were analyzed above.

Also prevalent in plasma were RNA fragments containing binding sites for DExH-box RNA helicase DHX30; GRWD1, a histone-binding protein that may also play a role in ribosome assembly; ZNF622m, a zinc-finger protein; BUD13, a spliceosome component; PPIG, a protein involved in protein-folding; and SERBP1, a mRNA-binding-protein.

TGIRT enzymes are advantageous for the analysis of tandem repeat RNAs because of their ability to reverse transcribe through stable higher-order RNA structures formed by interactions between the repeat units, enabling them to more completely reverse transcribe and better quantitate these RNAs than can retroviral RTs (58) . The peaks for the short tandem repeat RNAs in human plasma had a surprisingly narrow length distribution (sharp peak ~80 nt) with >50% of the short tandem repeat RNAs having complete or nearly complete read coverage across the annotated repeat region ( Fig. S14A and B). Of the top 15 RepBase-annotated repeat types with the highest peak count, 11 were low complexity sequences, such as polypurine or polypyrimidine tracts or simple repeat RNAs (e.g., (CCG)n and (TTC)n), and four were transposable element RNAs (AluSx, AluJb, FLAM_C and LINE-1 element HAL1-3A_ME) ( We noticed that some RepBase simple repeat sequences (e.g., (CATTC)n and (TTAGGG)n) were called by MACS2 at some loci with roughly equal numbers of reads on both strands, possibly reflecting mismapping of DNA or RNA reads. To address this issue, we used an Empirical Bayes method (Methods and Fig. S14C ) to identify the top 15 repeat sequences with the largest differences in the percentage of sense (+) orientation reads in DNase-treated plasma RNA compared to NaOH-treated plasma DNA and found that all corresponded to tandem repeats of short (3-6 nt) sequences, including centromeric and telomeric repeats (Fig. 3E, Fig. 5C and D, and Fig. S14C and D). We also detected potential HSATII RNAs, which had been identified previously as a repeat RNA present in plasma (12) , but with similar numbers of (+) and (-) orientations reads (2,327 and 2,414, respectively) and not called as peaks by MACS2.",

These retrotransposed mRNA sequences were identified by a BLAT search for >95% identity to the called peak in the human genome reference sequence and originated from six different highly expressed mRNAs (ribosomal protein mRNAs RPS3, RPL18A, and RPL41; translation elongation factor mRNAs EEF1A1 and EEF1G; and \u03b2-actin mRNA ( Fig. 8H and I, Fig. S16 ). All of these retrotranposed mRNA sequences had a short poly(A) tail (9-22 nt) and were flanked by short direct repeats (target site duplications (TSDs; Fig. S16 ), hallmarks of LINE-1 RT-mediated retrotransposition (68) . In all cases, the RNA peak identified in plasma corresponded to a smaller segment of the retrotransposed mRNA sequence that could be folded by RNAfold into a stable RNA secondary structure (\u0394G \u2264 -16.4 kcal/mole; Fig. 8H and I, Fig. S15D ). Comparison of genomic sequences showed the retrotransposition events that inserted the mRNA sequences within the introns were relatively recent, with six occurring in primates and two in placental mammals (Fig. S16 ). In all of these cases (and three additional cases of retrotransposed mRNA sequences described below), the RNA peak identified in plasma corresponded to a segment of the retrotransposed mRNA whose genomic sequence was identical to that in the gene encoding the functional mRNA (verified by searching the peak sequence against the hg19 human reference genome using BLAT and manually checking the sequences in the human genome browser and IGV), making it impossible to determine the origin of the RNA detected in plasma. Analysis of two introns with the largest number of homologous genomic sequences across primates and placental mammals showed that both the retrotransposed mRNA sequence and called peak region were more conserved than the flanking intron sequences, consistent with functional importance (Fig. S17) .",

Although not originally a focus of our study, we found that commercial plasma obtained by apheresis from healthy individuals had no detectable reads for pre-screened pathogens (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV-1, HIV-2, and syphilis), but did contain low levels of reads from bacteria and other RNA and DNA viruses ( Fig. 8) , with possible implications for the use of such plasma for clinical purposes (38) . The ability of TGIRT-seq to simultaneously profile a wide variety of RNA biotypes in human plasma, including structured RNAs that are intractable to retroviral RTs, may be advantageous for identifying optimal combinations of coding and non-coding RNA biomarkers for human diseases.",

The full-length, mature tRNAs and other sncRNAs present in plasma may be protected from plasma nucleases by stable RNA secondary or tertiary structure, bound proteins, or encapsulation in EVs, the latter suggested by TGIRT-seq analysis of RNAs present in highly purified EVs and exosomes secreted by cultured human cells, which likewise identified full-length mature tRNAs and Y RNAs as the most abundant RNA species (30) . Although the updated TGIRT-seq methods used in this work improved the detection of miRNAs and 5'-and 3'-tRFs, further analysis of these RNAs by RT-qPCR and Fireplex assays indicated that some miRNAs remained substantially underrepresented relative to RNAs >60 nt (manuscript in preparation). Thus, while comprehensive TGIRT-seq of heterogeneously sized RNA preparations can accurately determine the relative abundance of RNAs >60 nt (24, 33) , determining the quantitative relationship between very short RNAs and RNAs >60 nt requires orthogonal methods. Surprisingly, despite the size bias against very short RNAs, we identified 15 novel discrete short RNAs (13-25 nt; Fig.   8 , Fig. 9, Fig. S13, Fig. S15, Fig. S18 and Supplementary File). Only one of these short RNAs (non-high-confidence miR-4497; Fig. 9A ) could be found in miRBase, piRNAdb, tRFdb or cross-linked regions in AGO1-4 PAR-CLIP datasets (62) , raising possibility that they represent other classes of short regulatory RNAs, whose protein-partners and functions, if any, remain to be determined.",

The number of different mRNAs detected in plasma by TGIRT-seq was comparable to that detected in parallel assays of the same plasma by ultra low input SMART-Seq v4, which uses oligo(dT) priming, and higher than that in other studies using different methods that sequence mRNA fragments with or without size selection (4, 13, 14, 41) . Notably, the size distribution of cDNAs generated by ultra low input SMART-seq suggested that a substantial proportion of the mRNA fragments present in plasma have a length >200 nt (36%; Fig. 2A ), which would be lost by incorporating a size-selection step. Although the presence of other more abundant RNA biotypes is a limitation for mRNA detection by TGIRTseq, the proportion of reads corresponding to mRNA could be increased by depleting rRNAs and other abundant non-coding RNAs, by using a maximally efficient RNA extraction kit, and possibly by using plasma prepared from freshly drawn blood to minimize degradation of more labile mRNA fragments, as was done in the previous TGIRT-seq analysis of human plasma RNAs, which gave substantially higher proportions of mRNA reads (20) .",

As most cellular enzymes that function in RNA processing or turnover leave 3' OH groups while extracellular RNases, such as RNase 1, leave 3' phosphates (50, 51, 70) , these findings suggest that a high proportion of the mRNA fragments detected in plasma were generated by intracellular RNases that function in mRNA turnover rather than degradation of intact mRNAs that were released into plasma.",

Although these findings do not directly demonstrate the association of the annotated RBP with the protected RNA fragment, collectively they suggest that many of the mRNA fragments in plasma are protected from plasma nucleases by bound proteins, similar to the inferred protection of plasma DNA fragments by nucleosomes packaging or by the binding of transcription factors or other proteins (35) (36) (37) .

Seven of the full-length excised intron RNAs that we detected in plasma were annotated as both an agotron and mirtron, blurring the distinction between these two classes of RNAs. Notably, although we detected mirtron pre-miRNAs in plasma, we did not detect the corresponding mature miRNAs, raising the possibility that mirtron pre-miRNAs are selectively exported or have higher stability in plasma. While extracellular miRNAs have been suggested to function in intercellular communication (72, 73) , mirtron pre-miRNAs and agotrons may be as well or better suited for this role, with the mirtron pre-miRNAs entering cells as precursor RNAs that could be processed by DICER into mature miRNAs, and agotrons bound to AGO proteins entering cells as an RNP that could function directly in regulating gene expression in a miRNA-like manner.",

One of the most abundant full-length excised intron RNAs that we detected in plasma, PKD1 intron 29 (ID#333; Fig. 6 ), was highly conserved in both the parent gene and six distant pseudogenes (1 mismatch at a known SNP position), possibly reflecting selection for a sequence-dependent function of this intron.

Some of the intron RNA peaks that could be folded into stem-loop structures also contained unannotated discrete miRNA-sized RNAs (13-25 nt) that may have been processed out of the stem-loop structure. The latter finding raises the possibility that whatever their origin or original function, if any, structured excised intron RNAs in human cells may be accessible to DICER or other RNase III-like enzymes that cleave double-strand RNAs into discrete small fragments to generate a repository of non-coding short RNAs that could potentially evolve miRNA-like functions.",

In all cases, the retrotransposition event that inserted the mRNA sequence within the intron appears to have been mediated by a LINE 1 RT and was relatively recent, with most occurring in primates and a few occurring earlier in placental mammals. In all cases, the RNA peak detected in plasma matched a putatively structured portion of the mRNA sequence that was highly conserved within the intron, raising the possibility of functional importance. Additionally, for several highly expressed mRNAs, including three that were progenitors of processed pseudogenes in the human genome (TMSBX4, RPS29, and FTL), we detected antisense reads that could be cDNAs generated by an endogenous RT, possibly precursors of continuing retrotransposition events in human cells ( Fig. 9 and Fig. S20 ). Finally, we note that in addition to their biological and evolutionary interest, full-length excised intron RNAs and intron RNA fragments, like those we detected in plasma, may be uniquely well suited to serve as stable RNA biomarkers, whose expression is linked to that of multiple protein-coding genes. sequence (R1R) and the 6-nt UMI at its 5' end was then ligated to the 3' end of the cDNAs by using Thermostable 5\u2032 AppDNA/RNA Ligase (New England Biolabs) as described (35) . After clean up with a MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen), ligation products were amplified by PCR using a KAPA Library Amplification Kit (KAPA Biosystems KK2610) with 500 nM of Illumina multiplex primer (a 5\u2032 primer that adds a P5 capture site) and 500 nM of index primer (a 3\u2032 primer that adds an index and a P7 capture site). PCR was done with initial denaturation at 98 \u00b0C for 30 sec followed by 12 cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 45 sec, 60 \u00b0C for 15 sec, and 72 \u00b0C for 30 sec, and an additional final incubation at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. The PCR products were purified by using 1.3X Agencourt AMPure XP beads (2 or 3 cycles; Beckman Coulter) and evaluated by using an Sequence data processing. Fastq files were processed by using the TGIRT-map pipeline (74) with modifications for preserving UMI information and more stringent read trimming and filtering, including trimming of partial adapters and trimming each adapter sequence twice for each read. 6-nt UMIs were clipped and appended to the read ID, and only read pairs with average UMI Phred quality score <20 were retained.

In cases of identical overlap scores, a feature was selected with a priority to RBP-binding sites, repeat regions (RepBase), and NaOH-treated plasma DNA (n=4) datasets. To compensate for repeat sequences with low read counts, which could give misleading strand-specificity, we employed an Empirical Bayes method by using repeat sequences with high total counts (>50 deduplicated reads) regardless of strand from the combined plasma DNA datasets to construct a prior beta distribution of strand specificities for all repeat sequences (Fig. S14C ). This fitted beta distribution represents the probability distribution of detecting 0-100% (+) orientation reads for each repeat sequence in a pure DNA sample. Using the fitted beta distribution hyperparameters and the count data from either the plasma DNA or plasma RNA datasets, we then computed a posterior beta-binomial distributions of the percentages of (+) orientation reads for each repeat sequences, which represents how likely and to what degree the strand specificities were biased towards the (+) or (-) strand orientation. We then compared the posterior distributions for each unique repeat sequences between plasma RNA and DNA to obtain a distribution of differences in the percentage of (+) strand reads in plasma RNA versus plasma DNA (\u0394 %(+) in RNA vs DNA).",

Forty-seven of these newly identified RBP-binding sites peaks spanned two or more exons (45 in mRNAs, 1 in a pseudogene, and 1 in a lncRNA), with binding sites for AKAP8L (A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 8 Like, which functions in mRNA export) and TARDBP (TAR DNA Binding Protein, which regulates alternative splicing) found exclusively in such peaks (Supplementary File).

All of the mirtron RNA peaks detected in plasma corresponded to the fulllength excised intron RNAs (i.e., the putative pre-miRNA), to our knowledge the first time such intron-derived pre-miRNAs have been sequenced, and none corresponded to the annotated mature miRNA. Significantly, the remaining 21 putatively structured full-length excised intron RNAs, 48% of the total that we detected in plasma, including the second most abundant, PKD1 intron 29 (ID#333; denoted PKD1 in Fig. 3F), did not correspond to an identified agotron or mirtron (Supplementary File; additional examples in Fig. 6E and F). In initial mapping, the reads mapping to PKD1 intron 29 were distributed between the PKD1 gene and the same intron in six PKD1 pseudogenes (PKD1P1-P6), which are located on a distant duplicated segment of the same chromosome (chromosome 16). Notably, the introns in the parent and all six pseudogenes differed by only a single nucleotide at a known SNP position and were more conserved than the flanking PKD1 exons (6-8 mismatches in the 211-bp 5' exon and 1-3 mismatches in the 127-bp 3' exon), possibly reflecting that this intron has a critical sequence-dependent function. Nevertheless, only one of the full-length excised introns, PKD1 intron 45 (ID# M1; encoding miR-1225), was conserved in sequence across vertebrates and only six were conserved in sequence across primates (PhastCons scores \u2265 0.5; Fig. 7).

Sixteen peaks identified as corresponding to annotated RBPbinding sites mapped within introns (see above), and an another 15 such peaks were found among those mapping to long RNAs but lacking an annotated RBP-binding site.

            "text": "Preparation of RNA and DNA from human plasma. Human plasma pooled from healthy individuals was purchased from Innovative Research (Innovative Research, IPLA-N). The plasma was prepared by apheresis into K2-EDTA tubes and was certified by the provider as testing negative for HBV, HCV, HIV-1, HIV-2, and syphilis using FDA-approved methods.Nucleic acids were isolated from 4 mL of plasma by using a QIAamp cfDNA/RNA kit(Qiagen 55184) following the manufacturer's protocol, with the nucleic acids eluted in a final volume of 20 \u00b5L. To obtain plasma DNA, RNA was degraded by adding 1 \u00b5L of 5 N NaOH and incubating at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min. The solution was then neutralized by adding 1 \u00b5L of 5 N HCl, and the products were cleaned up with an Oligo Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo Research), with the DNA eluted in a final volume 10 \u00b5L. To obtain plasma RNA, DNA in the initial 20-\u00b5L nucleic acids solution was digested by adding 16-\u00b5L DNase I (1 U/\u00b5L) plus 4-\u00b5L 10X DNase I buffer (DNase I set; Zymo Research), incubating for 15 min at room temperature, and cleaning up with a Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator kit, with the RNA eluted in a volume of 10 \u00b5L. For one sample (ExoI_1), the DNase I-treated plasma RNA (~2 ng in 10 \u00b5L of eluant) was denatured by heating to 95 \u00b0C for 3 min and immediately placed on ice, then digested with exonuclease I by adding 1 \u00b5L of enzyme (20 U/\u00b5L) plus 1.5 \u00b5L 10X Reaction Buffer (Lucigen) and incubating 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, followed by clean up with a Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator kit eluted in a final volume of 10 \u00b5L. In two other samples, the initial 20-\u00b5L nucleic acids sample was split into 10 \u00b5L aliquots and digested with Exonuclease I as above. One aliquot was cleaned up with a Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator kit as above (ExoI_3), and other was treated with DNase I as above prior to clean up (ExoI_2; Supplementary File). To remove 3' phosphates and 2', 3' cyclic monophosphates, 2.5 \u00b5L of T4 polynucleotide kinase (5 U/\u00b5L) plus 2.5 \u00b5L 10X Reaction Buffer (Lucigen) were added to the initial 20-\u00b5L nucleic acids solution, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by incubation for 5 min at 70 \u00b0C to denature the enzyme followed by clean up with a Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator eluted in a volume of 20 \u00b5L. The samples were then incubated with DNase I prior to final cleaned up as above. Fragmentation of plasma RNA was done by using an NEBNext Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's protocol. 2 \u00b5L of 10X Fragmentation Buffer was added to 20 \u00b5L of nucleic acids and incubated for 2 min at 94 \u00b0C. The fragmented RNA was then cleaned up with a Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator kit, treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase to remove 3' phosphates and 2', 3' cyclic phosphates, cleaned up again with an RNA Clean & Concentrator kit, and treated with DNase I prior to final cleaned up as above. TGIRT-seq library construction. TGIRT-seq library construction was done as described (32), with modified RNA-seq adapters that decrease adapter-dimer formation and add a 6-nt unique molecular identified (UMI; six randomized nucleotides) in reaction medium containing 200 mM NaCl, which increases the efficiency of 3'-RNA-seq adapter addition by TGIRT templateswitching (26). For the initial template-switching and reverse transcription reactions, 10 \u00b5L of plasma RNA or DNA was pre-incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 \u03bcM TGIRT-III (InGex, LLC) and 100 nM of a synthetic RNA template/DNA primer substrate in reaction medium containing 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mM dithiothreitol. The synthetic RNA template/DNA primer consisted of a 35-nt RNA oligonucleotide that contains an Illumina read 2 (R2) sequence with a 3'-blocking group (C3 spacer, 3SpC3; IDT) annealed to a complementary 36-nt DNA primer that leaves a single nucleotide 3'-DNA overhang, an equimolar mixture of A, C, G, and T residues, that directs TGIRT-template switching by base pairing to the 3' nucleotide of a target RNA. Reactions were initiated by adding 1 mM dNTPs (an equimolar mix of 1 mM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP), incubated for 15 min at 60 \u00b0C, and terminated by adding 0.25 M NaOH and incubating at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by neutralization with 0.25 M HCl, with the resulting cDNAs cleaned up by using a MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen).

The TGIRT enzyme initiates reverse transcription by template switching from a synthetic RNA template/DNA primer substrate consisting of a 35-nt RNA oligonucleotide containing an Illumina read 2 (R2) sequence annealed to a 36-nt DNA primer. The latter leaves a single nucleotide 3' overhang (N, an equimolar mix of A, C, G, and T) that directs template switching by base pairing to the 3' nucleotide (N') of an RNA or DNA template, which is then reverse transcribed resulting in a DNA copy of the nucleic acid with the reverse complement of an Illumina read 2 sequence (R2R) seamlessly linked to its 5' end(20,35). After clean-up, a second adapter (R1R DNA), which contains the reverse complement of an Illumina read 1 sequence and introduces a 6-nt UMI (denoted UMI-R for the reverse orientation), is ligated to the 3' end of the cDNA using thermostable 5' App DNA/RNA ligase, followed by PCR with primers that add capture sites and indices for Illumina sequencing.
