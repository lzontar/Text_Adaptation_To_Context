It is hoped that the above analysis can provide a testable theoretical framework to allow for advances in our understanding and control of this deadly viral epidemic. In conclusion, early use of a combined anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs treatment, an inexpensive and readily available agents, in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia prevent complications of the disease and improve clinical outcomes. The combination therapy of anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs can over great benefits to COVID-19 patients with ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and ICU bed and mechanical ventilator shortages.
