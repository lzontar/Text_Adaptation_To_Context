A positive correlation has been observed between the spread of the virus and air pollution, one of the greatest challenges of our millennium. COVID-19 could have an air transmission and atmospheric particulate matter (PM) could create a suitable environment for transporting the virus at greater distances than those considered for close contact. Moreover, PM induces inflammation in lung cells and exposure to PM could increase the susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19 patient symptoms. The new coronavirus has been shown to trigger an inflammatory storm that would be sustained in the case of pre-exposure to polluting agents. In this review, we highlight the potential role of PM in the spread of COVID-19, focusing on Italian cities whose PM daily concentrations were found to be higher than the annual average allowed during the months preceding the epidemic. Furthermore, we analyze the positive correlation between the virus spread, PM, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor involved in the entry of the virus into pulmonary cells and inflammation.",

First, COVID-19, similarly to other viruses, could also have an airborne transmission, and particulate matter (PM) could act as a carrier through the aerosol, conveying the virus and increasing its spread. Secondly, PM could instead have induced damage to the lung cells, increasing the inflammation state [1] . This rise of inflammation may increase the mortality rate and the severity of expression of the disease in the most polluted areas. The virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the cell; ACE2 generates an anti-inflammatory peptide and is overexpressed to play its role in the case of inflammation from PM exposure, thus increasing the probability of COVID-19 entering the cells [2] . These hypotheses, which be applied in closed environments to decrease the probability of spreading these viral pathogens [8] . This phenomenon has been analyzed in a Hong Kong hospital during the 2003 epidemic. In this analysis, it is observed that the droplets are moist, but begin to evaporate after release by decreasing their size and may become small enough to circulate in the air. In the Hong Kong hospital, the distribution of air was analyzed, and it was shown that an unbalanced air diffuser distribution led to the spread of the Sars-Cov-1 virus in the 8 A department, where a greater incidence of the number of infections occurred [9] .",

The solid fraction is represented by diesel exhaust particles (DEPs), with a bio-persistent core of about 10-30 nm in diameter [24] . These primary particles, composed of elemental carbon, can then agglomerate into larger soot aggregates with mean diameters of 60-100 nm [23] . The DEP surface can adsorb more than 300 chemical compounds, which include PAHs, aliphatic hydrocarbons, quinones, transition metals, and others [25] .

Plants and cellular fragments, bacteria, fungi, viruses, parasites, and spores can be components of the bioaerosol [5] . Atmospheric PM would function as a carrier, or as a transport vector, for many viruses. Thus, PM may have increased the effectiveness of the virus spread in the aerosol as it creates a microenvironment suitable for its persistence [28] . PM10 and PM2.5 can be inhaled and, in addition to the polluting particles, the associated microorganisms are inhaled, too. Recent studies also indicate that microbial community composition and concentration are significantly affected by particle concentration and dimension [29] . The particles could also act as carriers, which have complex adsorption and toxicity effects on bacteria [30] . Certain particle components are also available as nutrition for bacteria and the toxic effect dominates in heavy pollution. The analysis of Franzetti et al. [31] of microbial community in PM10 and PM2.5 sampled in winter and summer in Milan (Italy) showed large seasonal variations in the microbial communities, with plant associated bacteria dominating in summer and spore forming bacteria in winter. The results obtained also indicate not only that the PM source can influence the presence of specific bacterial groups, but also that environmental factors and stresses can shape the bacterial community.",

The results of this article suggest that long-term exposure to air pollution increases vulnerability to the occurrence of more severe COVID-19 results. These findings are in line with the known relationship between PM2.5 exposure and many of the cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities that significantly increase the risk of death in COVID-19 patients [44] .

In fact, the main atmospheric circulation pattern during February 2020 was characterized by an anomalous anticyclonic system over the western Mediterranean basin, centered between Spain and Italy, and lower pressures over Northern Europe. This climatic condition, which produces dry conditions over southwestern Europe, may have provided optimal meteorological conditions for the virus propagation, both indoors and outdoors, in addition to the direct and indirect contact and short-range droplets [51] . Thus, PM may have played a carrier role for COVID-19. However, this remains one of the hypotheses, as the positive correlation between pollution in Lombardy and in other countries and the outbreak of the epidemic could also be the result of other reasons. In fact, it is known from both in vitro and in vivo data and from epidemiological studies that lasting exposure to airborne pollutants induces a state of chronic lung inflammation [12, 32, [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] .",

An increase in the mortality rate of several viral diseases has also been observed. So, in addition to analyzing the PM role in transmission, it is important to understand how exposure to pollutants can increase the susceptibility and severity of these diseases. As already discussed, PM has small dimensions and, for this reason, it can be inhaled. The repeated inhalation of these particles causes damage to lungs' health. Long-term exposure to particulate matter can induce systemic damage [32] . Exposure to pollution has also been linked to the high mortality of the Sars-Cov-1 virus. Cui et al. [57] , using the air pollution index (API), showed that, in the regions where this index was high, there was double the chance of death than the areas with a low API index. Similarly, in areas with a moderate API index, there was an 84% probability of increased risk of death from SARS. The authors conclude that lasting exposure to PM would increase the virus mortality rate.",

An analysis on lung cells A549 has shown a significant increase in IL8, an interleukin used as an indicator of the pro-inflammatory response following exposure to pollutants ( Figure 6 ) [52] . In fact, it has been observed that there are numerous mechanisms acting at the level of inflammation. For example, another mechanism to consider is the ability of pollutants to have effects on immunity by modulating the antiviral response of exposed subjects. A fundamental role of the inflammatory response is given by macrophages, cells that can incorporate foreign particles, including microorganisms, into their cytoplasm and destroy them (Figure 7 ) [56] . However, some studies have shown that exposure to pollution can reduce the phagocytosis ability of macrophages, which thus will not be able to properly inactivate the viruses [54] .

However, some studies have shown that exposure to pollution can reduce the phagocytosis ability of macrophages, which thus will not be able to properly inactivate the viruses [54] . Summing up, the exposure to polluting agents alters the immune response of the lung cells and induces an increase in oxidative and inflammatory stress. This cellular condition facilitates the attack of viruses and increases the severity of viral infections in exposed subjects. For example, pneumonia, often of viral origin, increases as a result of episodes of high PM10 pollution. A 1999 study already investigated how PM10 alters respiratory tract inflammatory responses to the syncytial virus (RSV), a frequent cause of viral pneumonia in infants and the elderly. It has been observed that, at high levels of PM10, the response to the virus is reduced because the immune response to both the virus and PM10, simultaneously detected, is less effective than the single immune response focused on defense against the RSV [59] . The Po Valley in northern Italy, where Milan is located, represents one of the most polluted areas of the country for both the high number of industries present and for its particular geographical conformation as it is enclosed between the Alps and the Apennines. During 2010, in Milan Torre Sarca, PM10 and PM2.5 samples were collected, and administered to mice for the purpose of analyzing the damage due to exposure to these particulates in the lung. The microbiological analysis revealed the presence of pathogens adsorbed to the particles [31] , and in alveolar cells and in the Summing up, the exposure to polluting agents alters the immune response of the lung cells and induces an increase in oxidative and inflammatory stress.

Exposure to DEP also results in increases in pro-and anti-oxidant (HO-1, iNOS, Cyp1b1, Hsp70) protein levels, although stress persists only in cardiac tissue under repeated instillations. Statistical correlations suggest that stress marker variation was probably the result of soluble components and/or mediators' translocation from the first deposition site. This mechanism appears more important after repeated instillations, as inflammation and oxidative stress endure only in the heart. In summary, the chemical composition of UFPs influenced the activation of different responses mediated by their components or pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative molecules, indicating DEP as the most damaging pollutant in the comparison [26] . Studies have shown that patients with systemic diseases have an increased risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 infection [61] .

            "text": "COVID-19 is characterized by the presence of spike proteins on its crown, which allow it to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on the cells. The virus enters the cells by endocytosis, infecting them. ACE2 is a membrane enzyme found in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines' cells, and it regulates blood pressure by catalyzing the cut of the vasoconstrictor peptide, angiotensin 2, into angiotensin 1-7, which is instead a vasodilator and anti-inflammatory molecule [66] . It is hypothesized that, because increasing age leads to an increase in blood pressure, as a compensatory response, our body expresses a greater number of ACE2 on cell membranes to respond to this effect. However, this increase in expression also heightens the targets that allow access to the COVID-19 virus. Some hypertensive drugs increase the expression of ACE2, so this correlation should be verified. ACE2 also has another task, as the angiotensin 1-7 peptide also has an anti-inflammatory function. It has been observed that the activation of ACE2 can reduce the severity of lung damage from hyperoxia by inhibiting the inflammatory response and oxidative stress. ACE2 can in fact inhibit the intracellular signal of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFKB) (pathway that activates the inflammatory response) and activate that of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) (pathway that activates the anti-inflammatory response), as a protective mechanism against ROS [67] .",

It was observed that, while in WT mice, there was an improvement in lung damage after a few days, in mice lacking ACE2, the improvement was less evident.

The first seems to be an excellent candidate because of the presence of a certain allelic variant in the Italian male population. ACE2, on the other hand, was not related to the sex-predisposition, but a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2285666, was detected in the Italian and East Asian population. This SNP had already been analyzed as a potential risk factor for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery problems, and thus could be a genetic variant indicating a comorbidity for the virus. According to the study, ACE2 would play an important role, but it remains to be assessed whether the increase in the level of lung gene expression is related to an increase in the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. This increase in the level of expression of this variant could be owing to exposure by PM [69] .",
