            "text": "u-Defensins are pleiotropic, macrocyclic peptides that are expressed uniquely in Old World monkeys. The peptides are potent, broad-spectrum microbicides that also modulate inflammatory responses in vitro and in animal models of viral infection and polymicrobial sepsis. u-Defensins suppress proinflammatory cytokine secretion by leukocytes stimulated with diverse Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Studies were performed to delineate antiinflammatory mechanisms of rhesus u-defensin 1 (RTD-1), the most abundant u-defensin isoform in macaque granulocytes. RTD-1 reduced the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin (IL)-1b, and IL-8 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human blood monocytes and THP-1 macrophages, and this was accompanied by inhibition of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Peptide inhibition of NF-kB activation occurred following stimulation of extracellular (TLRs 1/2 and 4) and intracellular (TLR9) receptors. Although RTD-1 did not inhibit MAPK in unstimulated cells, it induced phosphorylation of Akt in otherwise untreated monocytes and THP-1 cells. In the latter, this occurred within 10 min of RTD-1 treatment and produced a sustained elevation of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) for at least 4 h. pAkt is a negative regulator of MAPK and NF-kB activation. RTD-1 inhibited IkBa degradation and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and stimulated Akt phosphorylation in LPS-treated human primary monocytes and THP-1 macrophages. Specific inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) blocked RTD-1stimulated Akt phosphorylation and reversed the suppression of NF-kB activation by the peptide. These studies indicate that the anti-inflammatory properties of u-defensins are mediated by activation of the PI3K/ Akt pathway and suppression of proinflammatory signals in immune-stimulated cells.

            "text": "Mammalian defensins are cationic, tridisulfide-containing peptides comprising 3 subfamilies denoted as a-defensin, b-defensin, and u-defensin. Defensins contribute to host defense as antimicrobial agents [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and by regulating inflammatory [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and adaptive immune responses [14] [15] [16] [17] . a-Defensin and b-defensin have similar 3-dimensional topologies but differ in their disulfide linkages [18] . u-Defensins are macrocyclic peptides expressed in Old World monkeys (e.g., macaques and baboons) and are the only known cyclic proteins in animals [19] . The u-defensin backbone is produced by head-to-tail splicing of 2 nonapeptides excised from a-defensin-like precursors [20] . In rhesus macaques, alternate binary splicing of nonapeptides encoded by 3 precursor genes gives rise to 6 u-defensin isoforms, RTD-1 to RTD-6 [20, 21] . In baboons, alternate nonapeptide splicing produces 10 u-defensin isoforms [22] . u-Defensins are expressed at high levels in granules of neutrophils and in monocytes [20] , and RTD-1 is the most abundant u-defensin in macaques, constituting ;55% of the total u-defensin content of rhesus neutrophils [23] . u-Defensins have a major role in the antimicrobial activities of rhesus neutrophil-granule extracts [23] . Humans and other hominids lack u-defensins because of a stop codon in the preprocoding sequence of u-defensin genes in these species [24] . It has been suggested that the expression of u-defensins in Old World monkeys underlies differences in immune and inflammatory responses of these nonhuman primates from those of humans [19] .",

            "text": "Although a-defensins, b-defensins, and u-defensins were discovered based on their broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, subsequent studies have disclosed immune regulatory roles for these peptides [25] . For example, some a-defensins and b-defensins are chemotactic for T cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and monocytes [14] [15] [16] [17] , and they induce secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from activated dendritic cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and epithelial cells [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In contrast to these proinflammatory activities, we recently reported that u-defensins have anti-inflammatory properties both in vitro and in vivo. RTD-1 was a potent inhibitor of cytokine secretion by human peripheral blood leukocytes stimulated with diverse TLR agonists [26] . Naturally occurring u-defensin isoforms (RTDs 1-6) [23] possess variable potency in suppressing TNF expression by LPS-stimulated or Escherichia coli-stimulated leukocytes. RTD-1 suppressed inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-1b, and several chemokines in mouse models of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus infection [27] , E. coli peritonitis, and in polymicrobial sepsis [26] , and these effects strongly correlated with reduced mortality in each model. These results suggest that u-defensins modulate inflammation via regulation of pathways shared by diverse inflammatory stimuli. To identify regulatory pathways mediated by these novel macrocyclic peptides, we analyzed the effects of RTD-1 on stimulated THP-1 macrophages and human monocytes, evaluating effects of the peptide on cytokine expression and secretion and on signal transduction pathways involved in the inflammatory response.",

Initially isolated based on their antibacterial and antifungal properties in vitro [18] , subsequent studies have demonstrated broader host-defense properties mediated by their antiviral properties against herpes simplex virus [32] , HIV [33, 34] , and influenza [35] , and arming of phagocytes for enhanced killing of Bacillus anthracis [36] . Also, studies revealed that the protective effects of systemically administered RTD-1 in mouse models of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection [27] and sepsis [26] are mediated, at least partly, by suppression of immunopathological cytokine expression. To gain insights into the immunomodulatory mechanisms mediated by u-defensins, we analyzed the effects of RTD-1 on inflammatory pathways in THP-1 macrophages.",

Consistent with these findings, 10 mg/ml RTD-1, a concentration that we previously found was very effective in blocking TNF secretion from stimulated blood cells, was highly effective in blocking secretion of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-8 by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells and in human monocytes (Fig. 1) . Because RTD-1 binds inefficiently to LPS, its immune regulatory effects are not mediated by neutralization of LPS [26] . Here, we also show that RTD-1 suppression of these cytokines, and of CCL3 and CCL4, corresponds to down-regulation of the corresponding mRNA levels, indicating, for the first time, to our knowledge, that the previously observed anti-inflammatory mechanisms of u-defensins [26] are mediated by regulation of inflammatory gene expression as well. Of note, RTD-1 alone did not affect cytokine mRNA or protein levels in unstimulated cells (Figs. 1 and 2) .",

Consistent with this result, RTD-1 both suppressed TNF-a and IL-1b secretion by LPS-treated THP-1 cells in marked contrast to marimastat (Fig. 5) , a potent inhibitor of the TACE/ADAM17 sheddase that generates soluble TNF-a, which did not inhibit IL-1b release (Fig. 5) .

Inhibition of CREB and HSP27 phosphorylation is consistent with the suppression of p38 MAPK, which phosphorylates these proteins (Fig. 10) . p38 MAPK is also implicated in stabilization of mRNAs containing AU-rich elements, including TNF-a [39, 40] , IL-6 [41] , CCL3 [42] , IL-8 [41, 43] , and several other immune response genes [44] .

            "text": "RTD-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt was blocked by a specific PI3K inhibitor, implicating the PI3K/Akt pathway in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of RTD-1 (Fig. 8 ). PI3K-Akt is a known negative regulator of NF-kB and MAPK pathways and inhibits TNF-a gene expression in LPS-stimulated cells [31, 47, 48] . Consistent with this, resveratrol inhibits secretion of TNF-a and IL-1b in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells by stimulating the PI3K-Akt pathway, which is accompanied by inhibition of p38 and JNK MAPK [49] . Inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway increases the mortality and circulating proinflammatory cytokine levels in endotoxemic mice [50] , as well as in mice with polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture [51] . Additionally, glucan phosphate, which protects mice in the cecal ligation and puncture model, increased tissue PI3K activity in kidney, lung, and heart, correlating with survival of these animals [51] . Interestingly, both human a-defensin HNP1 and human b-defensins HBD2 and HBD3 stimulate expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from human conjunctival epithelial cells, which are accompanied by phosphorylation of Akt [12] . Both a-defensins and b-defensins are known to regulate cellular responses through receptor-mediated pathways; human neutrophil peptides induce signaling pathways through the P2Y6 receptor [7] . The human b-defensins HBD2 and HBD3 induce chemotaxis in monocytes through the CCR2 receptor [52] , and HBD2 induces chemotaxis in dendritic and T cells through the CCR6 receptors [15] . To date, there have been no reports of a receptor for u-defensins. Nevertheless, studies are underway to identify RTD-1 targets upstream of the PI3K-Akt pathway and the relationship of RTD-1-induced pAkt to downstream signaling pathways. The suppression of TNF-a secretion by RTD-1 is extremely rapid, suggesting that RTD-1 may also regulate pathways distinct from those involved in signaling and expression of proinflammatory genes [26] .",

For example, human b-defensin-3 inhibited LPS-induced gene transcription and proinflammatory cytokine secretion by mouse RAW264.7 macrophages via inhibition of the NF-kB pathway involving signaling through MyD88 and TRIF [53] . It has been suggested that the contrasting proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties reported for b-defensins may reflect differences in structural features and/or in the purity of the peptide preparations [53] . Another possibility, as suggested by others, is that the proinflammatory vs. anti-inflammatory properties of a single peptide may be a function of local concentration [55] [56] [57] .

(A) THP-1 cells were treated with diluent or 10 mg/ml RTD-1 and extracts were prepared from cells harvested at the indicated times. Extracts were resolved on SDS-tricine gels and probed using antiphospho-Akt (pAkt) and anti-Akt antibodies.

The immunomodulatory properties of the macrocyclic peptide are distinct from those of human a-defensins, and RTD-1 appears to suppress inflammation by mechanisms distinct from those of human b-defensin-3. Further, because RTD-1 and related u-defensins differentially inhibit TNF secretion from stimulated blood cells [26] , we propose that u-defensin isoforms may be unique tools for dissecting regulatory pathways that determine whether the host response to inflammatory stimuli results in health or disease.
