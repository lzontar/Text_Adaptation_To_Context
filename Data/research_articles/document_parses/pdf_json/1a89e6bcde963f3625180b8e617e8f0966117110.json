            "text": "Baculovirus expression systems are widely used to allow for the expression of recombinant proteins (1). The Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system (2) is often preferred as it is a rapid system where purified recombinant baculoviruses can be positively identified within 2 wk (3). The popularity of the system has further increased because the techniques used to isolate and purify the recombinant virus are relatively simple. A further advantage of insect cells is that they can fold, modify, traffic, and assemble newly synthesized polypeptides to form authentic, soluble end products (4-6). However, although the baculovirus-insect cell system has protein processing capabilities similar to those of higher eukaryotes, the insect protein processing pathways are not necessarily equivalent to those of higher eukaryotes (1). A good example of a similar but distinct processing pathway is the protein N-glycosylation pathway. Studies have shown that although insect cells could assemble N-glycans and transfer them to growing polypeptides, they have an unusual end-processing activity that trims an intermediate (common to both insect and mammalian pathways) to the insect-specific paucimannose end product (7). Nevertheless, baculovirus expression of viral proteins has been successfully used for the study of numerous viruses (1). This system has been particularly useful in the production of virus-like particles (VLPs) to study viral assembly processes and in several cases like the human papillomavirus and hepatitis C virus, such VLPs have been used in vaccine development (8, 9) . Another important application is the production of glycosylated viral antigens for immunization and protection against viral infection, for example, influenza A viral antigens expressed using baculovirus have been evaluated as potential vaccine candidates (10, 11) .",

            "text": "The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which affected more than 30 countries across five continents, has profoundly disturbed social and economic activities globally. A novel coronavirus, termed the SARS-coronavirus (CoV), was identified as the etiological agent of SARS (12) . The SARS-CoV genome is nearly 30 kb in length and contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) (13, 14) . Five of these ORFs encode for genes that are homologous to proteins found in all known coronaviruses, namely the replicase gene 1a/1b and the four structural proteins, nucleocapsid, spike, membrane (M), and envelope (E), whereas the remaining nine ORFs encodes for accessory proteins, varying in length from 39 to 274 amino acids, which are unique to SARS-CoV. The largest of these accessory proteins is termed 3a (also known as U274, X1, or ORF3). Antibodies specific for 3a have been found in convalescent patients (15, 16) and 3a has also shown to be expressed in SARS-CoV-infected cells (17) (18) (19) . 3a is a novel coronavirus structural protein as it is associated with virion purified from SARS-CoV-infected cells and it is incorporated into VLPs when co-expressed with M and E in the baculovirus system (20,21). 3a is predicted to have three transmembrane domains (13, 14) and when it is expressed on the cell surface, its N-terminus is facing the extracellular matrix whereas the C-terminus is facing the cytoplasm (19). It has also been reported that 3a is O-linked glycosylated, and this posttranslation modification may be important for its incorporation into virion (22,23) . The formation of a recombinant baculovirus expressing the 3a protein fused with a myc-tag at the N-terminus will be used to illustrate the methods used to express this protein using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system.",

As has been observed for other coronaviruses, the co-expression of two of the SARS-CoV structural proteins, M and E, is sufficient for the formation of VLPs. The M protein is a triplespanning membrane glycoprotein that interacts with the nucleocapsid and spike protein during virion assembly (26). The small E protein has more recently been recognized as an essential structural component of the coronavirion. A large portion of this protein is embedded within the viral membrane; only its hydrophilic carboxy terminus protrudes inside the virion (27,28). Nal and co-workers recently showed that the SARS-CoV M protein is N-glycosylated, whereas the SARS-CoV E protein is not glycosylated (29). Recombinant viruses expressing M and E respectively will be used to form VLPs. The co-expression will be shown by Western blot analysis, and the formation of VLPs will be shown by transmission electron microscopy. ",

This expression cas- sette is flanked by the right and left arms of Tn7. In the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system, recombinant bacmid DNA is formed using the site-specific transposition properties of the Tn7 transposon (32). Bacmid DNA (bMON14272) situated in E. coli DH10Bac cells, which allow for its propagation, contains the low-copy-number mini-F replicon, a kanamycin resistance marker, and lacZ\u03b1 from pUC. The attachment site for the bacterial transposition Tn7 (mini-attTn7) is inserted in the N-terminus of the lacZ\u03b1 peptide. When these cells are grown in the presence of X-gal and the inducer IPTG, blue colonies are formed, because the lacZ\u03b1 can complement a lacZ deletion present on the chromosome. The expression cassette present on the pFastBac1 (donor plasmid) is transposed to the mini-attTn7 attachment site on the bacmid with Tn7 transposition functions provided in trans by a helper plasmid (pMON7124). The insertion of the mini-Tn7 of the pFastBac1 vector into the mini-attTn7 attachment site of the bacmid disrupts the expression of the lacZ\u03b1 peptide. Therefore, colonies containing recombinant bacmids will remain white in the presence of X-gal and IPTG because the lacZ\u03b1 gene cannot express.",

The PCR using the M13 Forward (-40) and M13 Reverse primers is ideal to verify that the isolated bacmid DNA contain the gene of interest, because the bacmid contains these primer sites flanking the mini-attTn7. PCR fragments were amplified using a combination of various primers: 3a reverse and 3a forward primers (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3) , M13 Reverse and 3a forward primers (Fig. 2, lane 4) , or 3a reverse and M13 Forward (-40) primers (Fig. 2 , lane 5).

            "text": "1. Colony PCR can be used as an alternative technique to screen for positive colonies. This could be done using a toothpick or sterile yellow tip to pick a colony and submerge the colony into the PCR mix. The fragment can then be amplified using a PCR program that is optimum for the primer combination, with the exception being an extended initial denaturation time. The primer combination used within the PCR can be specific for the gene of interest, or specific for priming sites on the pFastBac1 vector which flank the multiple cloning site (pFastBac_ Fwd: 5'ACCATCTCGCAAATAAAG3' and pFastBac_Rev: 5'AACAACAATT GCATTCATTTT3'). 2. When preparing the multiple antibiotic plates, the tetracycline concentration was increased from 10 \u00b5g/mL to 15 \u00b5g/mL. This was done to decrease the amount of satellites colonies obtained. After the 48-h incubation, plates were incubated at 4\u00b0C. This allowed for an enhancement of the blue colonies, which allowed for a more defined distinction between white and blue colonies. 3. The amplicon size between the two universal primers on the bacmid DNA is 2.3 kb when no gene is inserted. If the gene of interest together with the bacmid DNA is greater than 4 kb, it is recommended that a Taq polymerase such as the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche) (38) is used, which will allow for amplification of larger fragments. 4. It is generally assumed that a confluent 25-cm 2 flask of Sf9 cells contains approx 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells. These cells, diluted in 10 mL of media, will then contain 1 \u00d7 10 6 cell/mL. 5. It is important to note that insect cells are not incubated in a CO 2 incubator but in a normal humidified incubator at 27\u00b0C. It is possible to obtain a slower growth at 19-22\u00b0C, but it is not advisable to exceed the temperature of 28\u00b0C, because the insect cells do not grow well at higher temperatures. Also, it is extremely hard for the cells to recover once they have been placed under stress. 6. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles of virus samples are not recommended, as this can decrease titer. It is therefore recommended that a working stock of recombinant virus be stored at 4\u00b0C. Virus stocks can safely be stored this way, without loss of titer, for a least a year. 7. Assuming that the P1 viral stock has a titer of 1 \u03eb 10 6 pfu/mL, the number of cells to be infected is 1 \u03eb 10 7 cells/mL (1 \u03eb 10 6 cells in 10 mL of media) and the MOI required is 0.1 pfu/mL, it can be calculated that 1 mL of the P1 viral inoculum is required. 8. For a quick scan of VLPs, after the lysed cells have been separated from the cell debris, it is possible to place an aliquot of the clarified supernatant onto a formvar coated copper grid, stain the grid with PTA and view immediately by transmission electron microscopy.",

After the cells were allowed to attach for 1 h at 27\u00b0C, bacmid DNA which contained the inserted gene of interest was transfected into the Sf9 cells using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). While the cells were attaching, 1 \u00b5g of Midiprep bacmid DNA was added to 100 \u00b5L of unsupplemented Grace's medium (Invitrogen) in a 1.5-mL microfuge tube (tube A). Six microliters of Cellfectin reagent was diluted in 100 \u00b5L of unsupplemented Grace's Medium in a separate 1.5-mL microfuge tube (tube B). The contents of tube A were added to the contents of tube B, and the solution was gently mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Five minutes before the incubation time had expired, the Sf-900 II SFM medium was removed from the cells, and the cells were washed once with 2 mL of unsupplemented Grace's Medium after which the wash media was removed. A volume of 0.8 mL of unsupplemented Grace's Medium was added to the DNA-lipid complex, and this solution was added to the Sf9 cells. 3. The cells were incubated at 27\u00b0C incubator for 5 h, then the incubation media was removed and 2 mL of the complete growth media was added to the cells. The six-well plates were then incubated in a 27\u00b0C humidified incubator for 72 h (seeNote 5). 4. The baculovirus infection cycle is characterized by a bi-phasic replication cycle during which two virion phenotypes are produced: (I) Occlusion derived virions (ODV) and (II) budded virus (BV) (33).",

These procedures include the co-infection of insect cells with M and E recombinant viruses, the expression of viral proteins by Western blot, and the purification of VLPs. The methods used to purify the VLPs were similar to that outlined in ref. 25. 3.3.1. Infection of Insect Cells With M and E Recombinant Viruses 1. Triplicate 175-cm 2 tissue culture flasks with 2 \u03eb 10 7 cells of Sf9 insect cells were co-infected with the two recombinant viruses expressing M and E proteins at an MOI of 5:1. These recombinant viruses were kindly donated by Dr. Yu-Chan Chao (24). 2. Once CPE was observed (usually 72 h postinfection) cells were harvested. Three rounds of infection were completed for a total of nine flasks. 3. To confirm that the co-infected cells were expressing both M and E, infected Sf9 cells were lysed with 5% SDS gel loading buffer. Even though the E protein can withstand temperatures up to 100\u00b0C, previous studies have shown that the M protein forms insoluble aggregates when boiled (34). Thus, E:M lysate was heated at 50\u00b0C for 15 min. 4. The lysate was then subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously.",
