We chose DTI for evaluation of hyperacute stroke management as this time interval best subsumes most processes possibly affected by our institutional protected code stroke protocol.

The remainder 116 patients (median age was 77 [66-83] years, 41.1% were females) were subjected to complete protected code stroke protocol and considered for final analysis. Upon arrival, 5 of 116 (4.3%) patients had fever or respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 that resulted in highest priority testing for SARS-CoV-2. Three of these patients were transferred from remote hospitals and required invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. Laboratory test results for SARS-CoV-2 were negative in all these cases. During the following clinical course, respiratory symptoms in these patients could be explained by aspiration pneumonia (n=3), pulmonary embolism (n=1) and stroke-related respiratory compromise (n=1). None of these patients had chest imaging features suspicious of COVID-19. Thus, no repeat laboratory testing was deemed necessary in these patients. Of the 111 patients who had negative infection control screens, all were tested negative. Baseline characteristics and test results are summarized in the Table. Of the 116 code stroke patients screened for symptoms of COVID-19, 28 (24.1%) patients were treated with thrombolysis alone (n=11), thrombectomy alone (n=6) or combination of both (n=11).

Although the Federal Institute for Disease Control and Prevention estimated overall infection risk in Germany as constantly high during the study period, numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saxony were lower than in federal states affected more severely by the pandemic (8) . Moreover, universal laboratory testing was established in a stage of the local outbreak when governmental containment measures have been initiated, which resulted in a slowdown of the spread of the disease. Pre-test probability of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the regional code stroke population has therefore likely decreased over the study period. Moreover, diagnostic performance of RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimen is unknown yet. Depending on the assay utilized, false-negative results can be expected in about 20% of patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 (9) . In our cohort, however, symptoms of viral illness were rare and none of symptomatic patients showed suspicious chest imaging during hospitalization. Lastly, it seems unlikely that stroke constitutes a frequent primary neurological manifestation of COVID-19 as recently discussed (7) .",

However, it is noteworthy that yield of universal laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 observed in our cohort of code stroke patients might vary among geographic regions due to widely varying infection rates limiting generalizability of our data. In fact, in a cohort of 215 consecutive pregnant women admitted for delivery at two hospitals in New York City, one of the epicenters of the pandemic, 33 (15.4%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a similar universal at-entry screening protocol (10) . Of these, 29 were asymptomatic underscoring necessity to consider geographical characteristics of infection spread in the development of disease-specific protection protocols.",
