Symptoms of Kawasaki disease in general and incomplete Kawasaki disease have been seen in a subset of pediatric patients having a current or previous infection of SARS-CoV-2. A viral infection, such as a SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, could result in extensive antigen-antibody immune complexes that cannot be quickly cleared in a subset of patients and thus create a type III hypersensitivity immune reaction and cause Kawasaki disease or Kawasaki disease symptoms (also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome) in a subset of patients. Extensive binding of antibodies to viral antigens can create antigen-antibody immune complexes, which, if not eliminated in certain individuals having dysfunctional complement systems, can start inflammatory type III hypersensitivity symptoms, including protease releases that can disrupt epithelium, mesothelium, and endothelium basement membranes, and induce pervasive inflammation throughout the body. This could continue after SARS-CoV-2 infections end if the first wave of protease attacks on basement membranes created new secondary autoantibodies and new uncleared antigen-antibody immune complexes.",

The SARS-CoV-2 virus matches approximately 80% of the genome of the Severe Acute Respiratory Symptom (SARS) virus, which originated from a bat virus (Ye et al. 2020) . Symptoms of Kawasaki disease in general or incomplete Kawasaki disease have been seen in some pediatric patients having a current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (Jankowicz 2020; Jones et al. 2020; McCrindle et al. 2017; Maggio and Corsello 2015) . Kawasaki disease in general, incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease and Kawasaki disease symptoms (also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome) seen in some pediatric patients after SARS-CoV-2 viral infections can be the result of virus infections having high replication rates, such as SARS-CoV-2 virus, creating uncleared antigen-antibody immune complexes and type III hypersensitivity immune reaction symptoms, as further discussed below.",

Similarly, some symptoms may moderate in patients after 1-2 weeks of fever, which is typically remittent and spiking (more than 39-40 \u00b0C); and without appropriate treatment, fever can continue for 1-3 weeks (McCrindle et al. 2017 ).

Proteases can destroy epithelium, mesothelium, and endothelium basement membrane proteins including elastin and collagen, essential to lungs and blood vessels throughout the body's organs, skin and other luminal tissues, and even attack cartilage, causing joint pain (Punt et al. 2019 ).

This can include protease releases that can disrupt luminal tissue epithelium, mesothelium, and endothelium basement membranes, and destroy elastin, collagen, and cartilage, and create pervasive inflammation throughout the body. Kawasaki disease, incomplete Kawasaki disease, or Kawasaki disease symptoms can result in some pediatric patients being unable to avoid a type III hypersensitivity reaction. This could continue after SARS-CoV-2 infections if the first wave of protease attacks on basement membranes created new autoantibodies and new uncleared antigen-antibody immune complexes. In summary, Kawasaki disease results if some pediatric patients have certain virus infections and have immunodeficiencies with slow or weak mobilizations of interferons, NK cells, and T cells to suppress viral replication, and thus depend on antibodies, while lacking the ability to quickly eliminate the extensive antigen-antibody immune complexes that are created.",
