Major cities have implemented their strategy to lift the emergent status of COVID-19, including the release of the lockdown of the city, and planned how to resume the emergent measures if they detect the second outbreak (1, 2) . The governments and public resources already provided the general answers to prevent COVID-19, such as washing hands, social distancing and refraining from going outside (3) . Clinical evaluation of the first outbreak of COVID-19 at the community level would suggest more personalized ways to prevent the second rather than the re-lockdown of cities or provinces, which causes a significant social impact. Herein, we initiated a clinical program of measurement of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific IgG antibody using the point-of-care test kit to assess the magnitude of COVID-19 in the community clinic setting under the approval of the institutional review board (IRB) (Approval Number: NC2020-01 of the ethical review board of Navitas Clinic, Tokyo, Japan).

A common idea on the antibody test for the contagious disease is a public health purpose, which is a benefit to predict the population already infected based on the proportion of persons with positive results. Delay in the expansion of the capacity for the diagnostic PCR test to detect SARS-CoV-2 in Japan has made difficulties in evaluating the COVID-19 pandemic, in turn, caused obstacles planning the recovery measures (4) .

The selection bias is a tough problem unless a full survey includes all residents is performed. Our IRB also mentioned that careful interpretation is necessary when we analyze the positive rate of the antibody test.
