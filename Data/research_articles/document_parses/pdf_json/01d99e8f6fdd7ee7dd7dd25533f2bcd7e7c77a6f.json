The greatest fallacy in this century is that communicable diseases are gradually being eliminated -this is untrue.

The epidemic process refers to the occurrence, dissemination, spread and termination of diseases, and depends on the infection sources, transmission routes and susceptible population [2] . Factors influencing communicable diseases could be divided into two groups: those affecting the epidemic process, including infection intensity, discovery time, etc; and those affecting emergency management, including social security, medical security, resource security, population quality, population distribution, knowledge on diseases, research capacity, social impact, public psychological tolerance, natural environment, etc [3] .",

The three cases were actually a family: the father (79 years old), the mother (76 years old) and the daughter (49 years old). The parents came from Wuhan to Zhuhai by high-speed train for a family reunion on 11 January 2020. The Zhuhai Center of Disease Control (CDC) conducted an epidemic survey for the three cases and their liquid samples were collected and sent to the National Health Commission. Combined with the epidemic survey, clinical symptoms and laboratory examinations, experts from the National Health Commission made a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 for the three cases. After treatment of 13 days, the daughter was discharged from hospital on 30 January 2020. The mother was classified as a critical COVID-19 patient and was discharged from hospital on 05 February 2020; she was the first cured critical COVID-19 patient in Zhuhai.",

Although it is far from Wuhan, Zhuhai experienced a great movement of population during this complex emergency. As a tourist destination, Zhuhai also attracts a large number of tourists. Therefore, the management of this emergency had great impact and challenges for Zhuhai. Facing the large population migration, Zhuhai took a series of measures in COVID-19 control and epidemiology.",

All students attended online classes at home after the semester was postponed. All residential areas adopted closed management. The CDC required that all residents returning to Zhuhai isolated themselves at home for 14 days. The government of Zhuhai established a series of measures and policies to support the many small-medium enterprises during such a longterm termination of business, including labour subsidies, scientific research input, loan discounts, tax relief, etc. The Zhuhai CDC established 10 emergency response teams for epidemiological investigation, case report, specimen collection, epidemic site disinfection, close contact management, emergency monitoring, health education, risk assessment, technical guidance, close contact tracing. Medical staff were sent to bus stations, quays, railway stations, and airports to screen suspicious cases. Fever clinics in Zhuhai were opened around the clock.",

Disinfection of elevator buttons, public toilets, and clinic waiting-room benches was also increased. Training of cleaning staff was strengthened, and they were given more comprehensive protective clothing. For doctors, morning shifts were reduced or staggered to avoid gathering. In order to strictly prevent the spread of COVID-19, inspectors detecting the virus wore protective clothing, N95 masks and goggles, and did not touch anything outside throughout the operation.",
