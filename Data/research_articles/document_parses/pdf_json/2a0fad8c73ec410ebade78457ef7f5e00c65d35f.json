On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. 1 As of March 30th, 2020, it has rapidly spread to more than 203 countries and with more than 638,146 cases worldwide and 30,039 deaths. 1 In India, so far 1071 cases have been reported with 29 deaths till March 30th, 2020. 2 The cases are rising at an exponential rate. Daily increase in the number of cases and associated mortality has forced lockdown in various countries to check the spread of the virus.",

More than 90% of its genome resembles that of a bat (now believed to be the zoonotic host for this SARS-CoV-2). 3 It resembles another severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from 2012 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 4, 5 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to b corona-virus (CoeV) and binds to zinc peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein for cell entry after activation of spike protein. 6 It is well known that ACE2 is expressed majorly in the lung (that appears to be the predominant portal of entry), also in the heart, intestinal epithelium, vascular endothelium, and kidneys. 7, 8 ACE2 has an important role in protecting the lung. But viral binding to its receptor deregulates the protective pathway and enhances pathogenicity. Expression of ACE2 on various organs could explain the multiorgan dysfunction 7,8 that has been described in some cases of COVID-19.",

Critical patients had septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction. The case fatality rate (CFR) varies by location and intensity of transmission and has been reported to be 0.7e5.8% 15 which is higher than that of influenza (0.1%). It is important to note that the CFR is dependent on the age at the time of presentation and associated comorbidities. The CFR is <1% for those aged <50 years, 1.3% for patients aged 50e59 years, 3.6% for patients aged 60e69 years, 8% for those aged between 70 and 79 years, and more than 14% for those aged >80 years. 14 In COVID-19, the overall symptomatic secondary attack rate (the rate of transmitting the disease to close contacts) is 0.45% for close contacts and >10% for household contacts. 16 In a two meta-analysis of six and eight studies from China that examined presence of comorbidities, 17, 18 hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes was seen in approximately 17%, 16.5%, and 5e9%, respectively, with higher incidence in those requiring intensive care.

Therefore, QT calculation in ECG is mandatory when drugs are used and QTc >500 should to be taken as the upper limit. Patients infected with COVID-19 are likely at increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Although there are no published case series thus far, there are reports of abnormal coagulation parameters in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) also have the potential to interact with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and can result in myopathy due to elevated statin levels when administered together. Similarly, heart failure has been described in almost 20% of cases, especially in those with underlying kidney disease. 31 However, it is not clear whether it is because of direct myocardial injury or exacerbation of underlying LV dysfunction. Cardiogenic shock is seen as a feature in critically ill patients with COVID-19. More commonly, it is a spectrum of overlap between cardiac and primary pulmonary manifestation, thereby giving a mixed shock picture. Brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography can help in clarifying the diagnosis. 32 It is important to ascertain the type to choose the Editorial / Indian Heart Journal xxx (xxxx) xxx mechanical respiratory or circulatory support with extracorporeal membranous oxygenation and so on. The utility of these support systems is still not well ascertained. 33 Another concern is patients of heart transplantation presenting with COVID-19. In 2 such cases described, 34 both presented with fever and had ground glass opacities in the lung. They responded well to treatment after management with antivirals and glucocorticoids. In a series of 87 patients, the incidence of COVID-19 in patients with heart transplantation was not found to be higher. 35 At present, it is not clear how COVID-19 is going to impact need and management of cardiac transplantation. More data are needed to draw definite conclusions in this regard. Further, if the recipient is negative for SARS-CoV-2 and has no prior exposure or symptoms in 2e4 weeks, it is currently recommended to continue heart transplantation without any change in regimens. 36 ",

Ribavirin and remedesivir are antiretroviral agents that interrupt RNA replication by acting as nucleotide analog. 41 Trials are underway to test their efficacy in COVID-19 42, 43 . Similarly, lopinavir/ritonavir are a combination of protease inhibitors that inhibit RNA replication have been tried with variable success in treating COVID-19 44,45. They have synergistic action with ribavirin. Other antiviral agents such as arbidol and favipiravir have been used but conclusive data are still awaited. 46 In view of wide interactions of these drugs with P2Y12 inhibitors, prasugrel is the preferred choice. 47 In case it cannot be used, a testing guided approach with platelet function assays is strongly recommended. In view of the cytokine storm seen in COVID-19, interleukin-6 antagonists (tocilizumab and sarilumab) are potential therapies that have been tried, and trials are underway. 48, 49 Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to block the entry of the virus into the cell. 50 A small study tested the effect of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on respiratory viral loads in patients with COVID-19. 51 Virus elimination was faster in those taking hydroxychloroquine and even faster when the combination was taken. This needs to be verified in future studies. Definitive evidence for their use in prophylaxis and management is awaited in trials. 52 Other potential promising therapies include use of recombinant human ACE2 (APN01) that reduces inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and has potential to neutralize the virus and protect the lung 53 and camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor that blocks SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. 54 Lack of definitive treatment and vaccines puts preventive strategies in forefront, while managing COVID-19. It is pertinent to note that healthcare workers are at elevated risk for contracting the virus. In a study, approximately 4% of the infected individuals were healthcare providers. 55 This emphasizes the need for selfprotection with personal protective equipment (PPE) before caring for patients with COVID-19. As discussed, the transmission occurs most commonly via respiratory droplets, and hence selfprotection with face mask, eye protection, gloves, and protective gowns are important for healthcare professionals. 56 ",

Proper screening of all the patients should be performed before they are allowed to enter the waiting area. Patients in the waiting area should maintain distance of more than one meter apart. Strict implementation of \"one doctor, one patient, and one consultation room\"\" should be performed. Patients and their family members need to wear masks and keep a distance. The medical staff of the electrocardiogram room was also in close contact with patients when performing electrocardiogram, so they also needed proper protection. Regular cleaning of noninvasive facilities such as ECG, echocardiography, Holter monitors, and so on has been proposed to safe guard self and others.",

A recent article has put the things in right perspective for all the intervention doctors and staff. 56 It is strongly recommended to defer all the elective cases to minimize exposure time and preserve resources. In patients with active COVID-19 presenting with ST elevation, myocardial infarction, and who are stable, fibrinolysis is a reasonable option. In case of urgent intention, for all staff directly involved in the procedure PPE should be worn, and powdered air-purifying respirators are reasonable. In patients requiring intubation, it should be ideally performed before arrival in the cath laboratory. It is recommended to use HEPA filters between tubes and bags. Further, while most of the laboratories are typically configured with positive pressure ventilation, many of such laboratories were converted to negative pressure isolation in setting of COVID-19 in China. 57 Regular education programs and close coordination with infection control team are also of paramount importance. Feeling under pressure and working under extreme circumstances are likely to be experienced by medical care providers on many occasions. Stress and the panic associated with the current situation will be more evident in the near future, so managing mental health and psychosocial well-being during this time is as important as managing physical health. In addition to self-protection, we should learn to protect our families from us during the epidemic.",

If this is not adopted, transmission chains can continue at a low level and then resurface once physical distancing measures are lifted. The time has come when we must think, plan, and perform professionally to fight this epidemic. Our interventions need to be self-assessed periodically whether they are relevant in the changing environment. We need not confine ourselves in providing temporary remedies but strive for ensuring sustainable and viable solution. While no definitive management is there, it is important that the countries those have not witnessed or are about to witness social transmission must learn the lessons well from countries already facing the disaster. Wisdom lies in not repeating the same mistake that others have done but learning from them.",
