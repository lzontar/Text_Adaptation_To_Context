Differing from other coronavirus (CoV) genera, which mainly infect birds or mammals, deltacoronaviruses (\u03b4-CoVs) reportedly infect both animal types. Recent studies show that a novel \u03b4-CoV, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), can also infect calves and chickens with the potential to infect humans, raising the possibility of cross-species transmission of \u03b4-CoVs. Here, we explored the deep phylogenetic history and cross-species transmission of \u03b4-CoVs. Virus-host co-phylogenetic analyses showed that \u03b4-CoVs have undergone frequent host switches in birds, and sparrows may serve as the unappreciated hubs for avian to mammal transmission. Our molecular clock analyses show that PDCoV possibly originated in Southeast Asia in the 1990s, and that the PDCoV cluster shares a common ancestor with Sparrow-CoV of around 1810. Our findings contribute valuable insights into the diversification, evolution, and interspecies transmission of \u03b4-CoVs and the origin of PDCoV, providing a model for exploring the relationships of \u03b4-CoVs in birds and mammals.",

Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012, CoVs have attracted more and more attention (De Groot et al., 2013; Peiris, Yuen, Osterhaus, & Stohr, 2003) . Deltacoronaviruses (\u03b4-CoVs) were first detected in wild Asian leopards and Chinese ferret badgers in 2006 during virological surveillance in southern China (Dong et al., 2007) , and are also a newly identified genus in the Coronaviridae subfamily. Subsequently, three avian \u03b4-CoV species were reported in 2009 and seven other \u03b4-CoV species were identified in birds or pigs between 2009 and 2012, respectively (Woo et al., 2012) . In 2014, an emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus, a porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), was detected in the USA (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014) . PDCoV has now been widely reported in the USA and Asia, where it has caused huge economic losses in farming. Recent researches have shown that \u03b4-CoVs are present in birds such as pigeon, falcon, and quail in Saudi Arabia (Lau et al., 2018) , and sparrow in the USA (Chen et al., 2019) , the PDCoVs are present in Tibetan pigs (Wang et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Host range is defined as the number of host species infected by a virus, which is a virus trait to understand the epidemiology and pathogenicity of pathogens. As one of the major factors in viral evolution, viruses rarely spread effectively in new hosts that were previously unexposed or uninfected (Lau & Chan, 2015) . The cross-species transmission of the virus poses a continuing threat to public health. Due to the increased contact between humans and other animal species, there is the possibility of cross-species transmission and subsequent disease outbreaks (Parrish et al., 2008) . Among RNA viruses, CoVs contain the large RNA genomes, ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length, which make them genetically more permissive to genome modification. About two-thirds of each CoV genome comprises two overlapping ORFs (Orf1a and Orf1ab). The remaining genome includes the structural proteins' ORFs; namely Spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N). Differences also exist in the accessory proteins encoded by different CoVs (Gorbalenya, Luis, John, & Snijder, 2006) . Previous studies have reported that cross-species transmission of CoVs is closely associated with the S protein, the nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) (papain-like protease, PLpro), and the accessory protein(s) (Cui, Li, & Shi, 2019; Forni, Cagliani, Clerici, & Sironi, 2017; Forni et al., 2016) .",

Presently, the greatest genetic diversity in \u03b1-and \u03b2-CoVs is documented in bats, and previous studies have confirmed SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are originated from bats (Hu et al., 2017; Memish et al., 2013) ; however, the evolutionary history of \u03b4-CoVs is poorly understood. Genetic diversity levels in \u03b4-CoVs suggest that they are likely to be widely distributed in avian species around the world. Even if no \u03b4-CoV have been found in human so far, we could not exclude that the host range of \u03b4-CoV (avian, pigs and leopard cats) might preclude of cross-species potential to other hosts, including humans. Therefore, the possible zoonotic spread of new viruses to humans would pose a significant threat to global public health. Here, we investigated the origin and evolution of \u03b4-CoVs. The data we have obtained will help with the preparation of countermeasures against the possible future risk of zoonotic transmission of \u03b4-CoV to humans.",

Using the genome from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, a \u03b3-CoV genus member) as the outgroup, maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the complete genome ( Figure   1A ) from \u03b4-CoVs using IQ-TREE. Based on the phylogenetic tree topologies and viral hosts, the \u03b4-CoVs separated into three groups: PDCoVs, Sp-CoVs, and other bird-CoVs. Moreover, we constructed three phylogenetic trees based on the ORF1ab, S, and E-M-N genes sequences of \u03b4-CoVs. The topological structure is basically consistent between genome and ORF1ab; however, Sp-CoVs strains showed inconsistent topology in the phylogenetic trees of S and E-M-N gene, differing from the ORF1ab gene phylogenetic tree ( Figure S1A ). This inconsistent topologies of S and E-M-N genes of Sp-CoVs, in which outlier sequences were found in other bird-CoVs subgroups in a phylogenetic tree ( Figure S1A ) might be attributed to cross-species transmission or/and genomic recombination.",

Moreover, genetic diversity in ADCoV exceeds that in PDCoV, suggesting a long evolution of \u03b4-CoVs in birds. Thus, a possible risk is that \u03b4-CoVs will spread more widely in birds. As we know, Southeast Asia contains one of the most globally abundant and diverse bird populations, and previous research indicates that avian influenza always originates in Asia, especially Southeast Asia (Martin et al., 2006) . Whether a high risk for new ADCoV infections in mammals exists in Southeast Asia deserves future attention. Certainly, the close genetic similarity, codon usage, and GC bias in \u03b4-CoVs isolated from sparrows and pigs makes the Sp-CoV/PDCoV lineage particularly attractive for researchers in the context of cross-species transmission. S gene from Sp-CoVs had a large span through all \u03b4-CoVs, which may allow the virus to spill over into new hosts.

However, our results suggest that the origin of PDCoV may be the result of a recombination between different Sp-CoVs. Interestingly, the GC content of PDCoVs is slightly below that of Sp-CoVs, possibly promoting adaptation in the avian-derived virus to replicate in mammals. Wong, et al. reported that the selective pressures on Human Influenza Virus reduced the GC content of the viral genome, and this might assist the formation of less stable viral mRNA structures at lower host temperatures and enable the virus to escape the innate immune system (Wong, Smith, Rabadan, Peiris, & Poon, 2010) . It is possible that a similar situation would enable PDCoV to undergo efficient replication in pigs via a reduced GC content. Additionally, \u03b4-CoVs are prone to cross-species transmission in birds, but the lower interspecies hurdles in pigs would make them more susceptible to avian virus infections. Generally, cross-species transmission of CoV is closely associated with the viral S protein, PLpro and the accessory proteins. As one of the main structural proteins, their S protein participates in receptor-binding and host adaptability (Cui et al., 2019) . PLpro is involved in processing the viral polyproteins and regulates the innate immune response (Forni et al., 2016) . Our results showed that more sites underwent positive selection in the PLpro gene than in the S gene (2 sites vs 12 sites), which implies that the S gene has played a more important role during PDCoV evolution. For the accessory proteins, \u03b4-CoVs own open reading frames (ORFs) encode a wide variety of accessory proteins, some of which are host derived, while some have been lost during viral evolution. Studies have shown that the accessory proteins in PDCoV target the host's antiviral innate immune responses, which are also thought to promote viral adaptation to the host (Fang et al., 2018) . Our results reveal that the number of accessory proteins in PDCoV are fewer than in the other \u03b4-CoVs. This suggests that some of the accessory genes are not essential for PDCoV replication in pigs, and are also not the most important factor for the host switch from birds to mammals.",

(A) ML phylogenetic tree for the \u03b4-CoVs genome. The best-fitting nucleotide substitution model was determined automatically by the program following 1000 bootstrap replicates, and the phylogenetic trees were visualized using iTOL v.4 (Interactive Tree of Life, http://itol.e mbl.de/). The PDCoVs collapsed into one node are shown in a blue triangle, the Sparrow-CoV is shown in red font, and the other ADCoVs are shown in green font, bootstrap support values higher than 95 are shown with orange dots. The sequence names of \u03b4-CoVs are shown in a uniform format (NCBI accession number-Strain name-Target host-Isolated country-Isolated year). (B) Genome-based recombination analysis using SimPlot v3.5. The settings were as follows: window size, 500; step size 20; gap stripping, on; Kimura distance model. (C) The different event costs used for the host-virus phylogeny congruence test. All possible cospeciation, duplication and host switch events are shown. Sp-CoV is marked in red font.
