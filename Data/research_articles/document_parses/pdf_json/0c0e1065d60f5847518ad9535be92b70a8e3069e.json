Only light microscopy findings were reported. 19 Acute cardiac injury is also described in patients with SARS-CoV-2, with one study finding elevated cardiac troponin in 10% (12/120) of critically ill patients, associated with increased mortality. Although the authors propose viral myocarditis as the etiology of cardiac death in these cases, histopathological examination or direct viral testing of myocardial tissue are not reported from this series. 20 One individual case report describes a patient with rapidly progressive cardiogenic shock attributed to SARS-CoV-2 viral myocarditis, who ultimately succumbed to non-cardiac complications of their illness. The patient underwent endomyocardial biopsy demonstrating low-grade inflammatory infiltration of the myocardium. SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were visualized in the cardiac interstitium by electron microscopy. RT-PCR and viral culture were not performed. 21 In another reported case, light microscopy findings were similar, but SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in myocardium by RT-PCR. In this case, electron microscopy and viral culture were not performed.

Because of the prevalence of COVID-19 associated cardiac dysfunction, donors should be screened for cardiac dysfunction and excluded accordingly.",

In autopsy specimens from six patients with severe COVID-19 and acute renal failure, histopathology revealed acute tubular necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated viral nuclear protein in the cytoplasm of tubular epithelial cells in all six samples. Several control stains were not included. 23 In a larger series totalling 26 deceased patients with severe COVID-19, 9 patients had renal tissue samples examined by electron microscopy, with intact virus particles detected in 7 cases. A different group of 6 patients had renal tissues examined by immunohistochemistry, with SARS-CoV-2 nuclear protein detected in 3 cases. Unfortunately, complete clinical data including kidney function were not available for more than half of the tested patients, although all wzere deceased due to severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure and multi-system organ failure. 24 One autopsy study examined specimens of lung, heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, stomach, intestine, and skin from three patients with COVID-19 using histopathology, electron microscopy, and real-time PCR. The authors report degeneration, necrosis, microvascular injury, and pathologic findings of chronic disease in non-lung tissues but state that electron microscopy and real-time PCR revealed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-lung organs. 25 In summary, autopsy studies of SARS-CoV-2 are limited. There has been no demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 in liver. SARS-CoV-2 virions have only been detected in myocardium from a single patient with severe cardiac dysfunction, but not in others who were similarly assessed. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in kidney. None of these studies has performed viral culture to demonstrate the presence of transmissible virus. These studies were performed in patients with the most severe presentations of COVID-19 and organ dysfunction who are unlikely to be suitable organ donors based on medical quality. Thus, extrapolation of these results to persons with asymptomatic or mild infection with isolated respiratory symptoms is likely not appropriate. CoV-2 additionally fall within the same subgenus, bind to the same receptor, and share 79% genetic homology. 26 There are no reports of transmission of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV through either transfusion or transplantation, although these viruses were less widespread than SARS-CoV-2 and some transplant",

There have been no proven or probable reports of any RNA respiratory virus, including influenza, transmitted to a non-lung organ transplant recipient. [37] [38] [39] This is despite the fact that several common RNA respiratory viruses may be associated with viremia, similar to SARS-CoV-2. In a study of immunocompromised patients with respiratory syncytial virus, viral RNA was detected in blood of 30% of patients. 40 Influenza RNA has been detected by RT-PCR of blood and stool from infected typical hosts. 41,42 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza has also been detected by immunohistochemistry in the kidney. 43 Thirteen patients who were unintentionally transplanted with organs from donors later discovered to be positive for 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza had favorable outcomes, without infection. Six of the thirteen recipients did not receive any posttransplantation prophylaxis against influenza. 44 The availability of vaccination, treatment, and prophylaxis appropriately factor in the decision to accept organs from deceased donors with influenza. Currently, such an Accepted Article option is not available to mitigate the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 in an exposed transplant recipient. In summary, considering decades of accumulated experience with other RNA respiratory viruses in transplantation, there is no well-documented transmission of any of these viruses through non-lung organ transplantation.",

The possibility of donor to recipient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded with the existing clinical data, but, for some patients, that uncertainty may be preferable to the alternative. A critical review of available data and biology of SARS-CoV-2 and related RNA respiratory viruses suggests that the risk for transplant transmission is low, especially among donors with mildly Accepted Article symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. Looking beyond individual patients' outcomes, we must also consider possible impacts on healthcare workers and health systems. As the acuity of this pandemic changes, a reevaluation of the current recommendations is warranted. For patients with life-threatening organ dysfunction and a low probability of a suitable and timely non-infected match, organ transplantation from carefully selected deceased donors with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a life-saving opportunity.

We have presented evidence that recipients of organs from carefully selected donors with SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to develop transplant-transmitted infection, but surgical teams will be in close contact with infected donors. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare workers has been described in the context of rapidly expanding disease clusters in China, Italy, and the United States. The risk of transmission is increased in settings where personal protective equipment and other resources are strained by an overwhelming caseload and inadequate supplies.45 In contrast, there is published evidence across a range of healthcare settings demonstrating that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the healthcare setting can be prevented with appropriate infection control measures.[46][47][48] Transplants from SARS-CoV-2 positive donors should occur only in the context of optimal infection control measures where personal protective equipment is available and where staff are appropriately trained and supervised in its use. Hospitals already operating at or above capacity may not be able to guarantee the availability of the resources, including staff, critical care facilities, and personal protective equipment necessary to make these transplants successful.Transplant candidates or their surrogates must receive clear and comprehensive counseling before choosing to accept a transplant from a SARS-CoV-2 positive donor, including the uncertainty of transmission and associated consequences. In an environment of uncertainty, candidates or their surrogates should be engaged in shared decision making that transparently addresses the anticipated/intended outcomes of transplantation, and the broad range of potential unanticipated outcomes. Transplants from selected SARS-CoV-2 positive donors should be undertaken with the intention to benefit patients, but with acknowledgement of the possibility of harms. Through a process of informed consent, transplant programs can establish trust and prepare stakeholders for the possibility of an unanticipated outcome, even donor-derived infection, which is already acknowledged for a range of infectious agents.",
