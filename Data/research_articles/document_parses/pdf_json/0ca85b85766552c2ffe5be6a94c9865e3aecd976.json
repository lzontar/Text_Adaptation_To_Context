Although the majority of children have mild disease and recover quickly, almost 5 million children worldwide progress to life-threatening organ dysfunction and even death (4) . The concept of sepsis has been traditionally used to characterize children with infection that manifest higher severity of disease with signs indicating presence of a systemic response to infection (5) . The World Health Organization resolution on sepsis (6) stipulates quality improvement and public health interventions at local, national, and international level to reduce the burden of sepsis. Although recent meta-analyses indicate that sepsis is responsible for a substantial proportion of global childhood deaths from infection (7), evidence demonstrates substantial variability in the definition of sepsis and lack of precision when applying the term in clinical practice, coding, and research (8) which may lead to underestimation of the burden of sepsis.",

SIRS was conceptualized as the body's systemic response to an insult (e.g., infection) and included age-specific abnormalities in two or more of the following variables: 1) body temperature; 2) heart rate; 3) respiratory rate; or 4) WBC count. However, these criteria were nonspecific and do not reliably discriminate children with infections on a more severe trajectory or a higher risk of mortality (12) . Ideally, sepsis criteria should meet both the need for sensitive early recognition as well as for specific separation of severe from mild infections. In the absence of a gold standard test to diagnose sepsis, the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference used expert opinion to provide agespecific cutoffs for SIRS criteria and operationalized definitions of organ failures (9) . Since then, numerous studies have provided insights into the epidemiology, recognition, and treatment of sepsis in children (13) (14) (15) . However, the diagnostic value of specific criteria to identify children with sepsis has never been rigorously evaluated.",

This review only assessed hemodynamic criteria (hypotension, vasopressors, and hypoperfusion) and excluded pediatric studies, randomized controlled trials, and studies of specific pathogens and populations, thereby limiting its applicability to pediatrics. Furthermore, results of adult trials cannot be automatically generalized to the pediatric population because of significant differences in epidemiology (16) , mortality rates (17) , underlying diseases (18) , disease-specific outcomes (13, 19) , and differing results of septic shock trials in adults and children (20, 21) . Therefore, SCCM convened the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce in June 2019 to assess, develop, and validate criteria for the identification of sepsis in children. The Taskforce recognizes the need to assess both criteria for recognition of children with possible sepsis and for identification of sepsis leading to poor outcomes such as multiple organ failure or death. As part of this process, the Taskforce will conduct a systematic review, a survey, a Delphi process and a data-driven derivation and validation exercise. The goals of this systematic review are to synthesize evidence on individual factors, clinical criteria, or illness severity scores that may be used to identify children with infection who have or are at high risk of developing sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and separately to synthesize evidence on those factors, criteria, and scores that may be used to identify children with sepsis who are at high risk of progressing to multiple organ dysfunction or death.",

Literature before 2004 often lacked reference to specific sepsis criteria and as such, we anticipated it would be hard to reliably extract associations between sepsis criteria and outcomes prior to 2004. Studies with fewer than 50 children with sepsis, septicemia, severe sepsis, or septic shock will be excluded as they are unlikely to be adequately powered to describe criteria for recognition of possible sepsis or criteria for sepsis leading to multiple organ failure or death and are likely to have a high risk of bias due to their small sample size (22) .

Conflicts will be resolved by discussion or by a member of the Systematic Review Working Group if consensus cannot be reached. Data extraction will include information related to study characteristics (i.e., title, authors, year of publication, country, language, journal, study design, sample size, and inclusion/exclusion criteria); population characteristics (age, sex, admission diagnosis, level of care available, location of the admission within the hospital/clinic, disease classification of population studied, and patient comorbidities); exposure (pathogen, source, community-acquired vs hospital-acquired infection, or sepsis as per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria [33] , specific definition of sepsis used); clinical criteria (Table 1) ; and outcomes (PICU admission, 28-d mortality, PICU mortality, PICU and/or hospital length of stay, and NPMODS). Studies may report varying thresholds of \"normal\" for laboratory data such as serum glucose and bicarbonate; these thresholds will be documented in our data abstraction form. The authors will be contacted to obtain missing data on study methods or patient level data needed for computation of sensitivity and specificity of dichotomous outcomes. We will not contact authors for patient level data for calculation illness severity scores if these were not reported in the original article.",

Continuous outcomes will be summarized using mean and sds or medians with interquartile ranges as appropriate. Binary outcomes will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. We will construct a two-by-two table for each criterion identified in the included studies and will add 0.5 to all cells if any of the cells are zero. For each criterion, we will calculate its sensitivity and specificity for predicting sepsis, multiple organ failure, or death and report the corresponding 95% CIs. We will also calculate the likelihood ratios for the presence (positive likelihood ratio) or absence (negative likelihood ratio) of each criteria/score and pretest and posttest probabilities of the outcome (sepsis, multiple organ failure, or death). For interventional studies, only the outcomes in the usual care arm of the study will be included in these estimates. When a criterion is assessed in four or more studies, we will perform a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies to calculate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity as well as provide the pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We will use a hierarchical random-effects bivariate logistic regression model, which accounts for heterogeneity as well as the correlation between sensitivity and specificity. We will examine sources of heterogeneity, including differences in methodology, setting, patient populations as well as differences in clinical presentations (e.g., different diagnosis or disease prognosis). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed and reported using a chi-square test and the I 2 statistic. It is likely that there will be significant heterogeneity between studies and we will therefore pool results when studies are considered comparable (I 2 value < 40%) using a random-effects meta-analysis. We will perform subgroup analyses with respect to age, diagnostic category (e.g., oncology, severe acute malnutrition), community-versus hospital-acquired infections, healthcare setting (low vs high resource), and other relevant factors with the aim of providing more precise pooled estimates. We will present the results using sensitivity-specificity coupled forest plots as well as pooled receiver operating characteristic curves.",

We will choose a threshold used in the majority of the studies and contact authors to receive individual-level data for the rest of the studies to calculate sensitivity and specificity. For studies with missing thresholds, we will impute missing data based on information provided in similar studies. Similarly, some studies report summary measures of the continuous outcome (e.g., mean and sd of lactate levels) rather than provide sensitivity and specificity by dichotomizing the outcomes. For such studies, we will request patient level data, and if provided, will calculate sensitivity and specificity based on a threshold used in the majority of the studies.",
