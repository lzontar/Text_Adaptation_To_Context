One approach for detecting cases without the need of extensive testing relies on voluntary self-reports of symptoms from the general population. 1 However, the incubation period of COVID-19 2 may limit active monitoring based primarily on symptoms. Considering that nearly one of every four adults in the United States already uses Twitter, and nearly half of them use it on a daily basis, 3 in this proof-of-concept study, we assessed (1) whether users report personal information on Twitter that could more broadly indicate potential exposure to COVID-19, and (2) the utility of our social media mining approach for automatically detecting these users and analyzing the chronological and geographical distribution of their reports. To our knowledge, the use of real-time Twitter data to track COVID-19 4 has not extended to user-level, personal reports. Thus, our natural language processing and machine learning framework could advance the use of Twitter data as a complementary resource \"to understand and model the transmission and trajectory of COVID-19\". 5 .

We used a maximum sequence length of 100 tokens to encode. After feeding the sequence of token IDs to BERT, the encoded representation is passed to a dropout layer (dropping rate of 0.1) and, then, a dense layer with 2 units and a softmax activation, which predicts the class for each tweet. For training, we used Adam optimization with rate decay and warm-up. We used a batch size of 64, training runs for 3 epochs, and a maximum learning rate of 1e-4 for the first 10% of training steps, with the learning rate decaying to 0 in the latter 90% of training steps. Prior to automatic classification, we pre-processed the tweets by normalizing user names (i.e., strings beginning with \"@\") and URLs, and lowercasing the text.
