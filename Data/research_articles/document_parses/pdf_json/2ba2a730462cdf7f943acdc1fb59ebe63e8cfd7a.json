Since December 2019, it has infected millions of people, caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands, and resulted in incalculable social and economic damage. Understanding the infectivity and transmission dynamics of the virus is essential for understanding how best to reduce mortality whilst ensuring minimal social restrictions to the lives of the general population. Anecdotal evidence is available, but detailed studies have not yet revealed whether infection with the virus results in immunity. In this work, we have extended the generic SIR framework to analyse empirical infection and fatality data from different regions to investigate the reinfection frequency of the disease. Our model predicts that cases of reinfection should have been observed by now if primary SARS-CoV-2 infection did not protect from subsequent exposure in the short term, however, no such cases have been documented. This work, therefore, provides a useful insight for serological testing strategies, lockdown easing and vaccine design.",

To date, the virus has resulted in over six million confirmed infections, almost 400,000 deaths and caused huge social and economic damage. Over 90% of countries have implemented travel restrictions [2] and countless businesses have been closed.",

Longitudinal profiles of antibody responses in recovered SARS-CoV-1 patients showed that IgG levels were maintained in >90% of patients for 2 years, however this dropped to approximately 50% of the convalescent population after 3 years [6] . While it is too soon to predict the long term serological response of SARS-CoV-2, it has been shown in a study of 285 individuals presenting with COVID-19 that 100% tested positive for IgG [7] , and a study of hospital staff in France also supported the use of serologic testing to diagnose those who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 [8] . Rhesus macaque monkeys that had recovered from a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection showed no recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms upon being re-challenged with the virus [9] [10] , however, it is not clear whether this immunity will apply to the human population, or how long it may last for. It is therefore important to investigate whether infection provides immunity against further reinfection, as this can open up new quarantine easing strategies and decrease the further social and economic burden of the virus. SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) modelling uses a set of differential equations to determine how the number of infected and recovered individuals changes over time given a specified rate of infection and recovery. It was first used in 1927 by Kermack and McKendrick [11] and has since been used to model epidemics from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) [12] to SARS [13] . Variations of SIR modelling have been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to look at the varying burden on healthcare systems based on public health intervention [14] , the absence of a stable disease-free equilibrium [15] and infection rate [16] , as well as the eventual size of the overall pandemic [17] . An extension of the model has also been used to simulate the changing death rate as a function of the number of individuals infected, and it was found that an equilibrium point was reached where there are no further reinfections [18] .",

Figure 2 shows how the population of each state in the model changed over the course of a typical simulation. The number of susceptible individuals initially remained steady, until day 55, when there was a sharp decline due to the increase in primary infections (Figure 2A ). The number of individuals infected just once started to increase steadily after day 40, and continued to do so throughout the simulation until lockdown effects enacted on day 53 (the 23 rd of March 2020) took effect to control the number infected. The average recovery time used in the simulations was set as 28 days, as this is greater than the median recovery time suggested in the report of the WHO-China joint mission on coronavirus disease 2019 [21] . After the 28-day lag time, the individuals infected once started to recover, resulting in an increase in the Recovered (once) state through to the end of the simulation ( Figure 2B ). As the number of recovered individuals started to increase, so did the number of people infected for a second time, and similarly the number of people recovered for the second time started to increase after the 28 day recovery lag time ( Figure 2C ). The number of deaths started to rise from day 55 onwards, and fatalities continued to increase through to the end of the simulation ( Figure 2D ).",

The number of modelled reinfections (0.1\u00b10.3; Table 2 ) reflects this, and so even without immunity from infection no reinfections would be expected to occur. Similarly, in Switzerland and Singapore, very low numbers of reinfections were predicted by the model (6.2\u00b12.5 and 6\u00b12 respectively; Table 2 ). It is possible that these very low numbers of reinfection cases could have been missed due to misdiagnosis or lack of follow up testing. We therefore applied our model to data from Germany [19] , Italy [19] , New York City [20] [22] and the USA as a whole [19] , which have recorded far higher numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections (174355, 224760, 189027 and 1467884 respectively, when the data was accessed).

We therefore compared the results of our simulation for Germany with and without the recovery data as an input. Without recovery data, the model used a 28-day lag before recoveries started, meaning very few secondary recoveries took place ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, when recovery data was included secondary recoveries began very soon after reinfections had taken place, usually the next day, and by the end of the simulation, almost the entire infected population had recovered ( Figure 4B ). Because secondary recoveries occurred faster, there were 76 more reinfections with the reinfection data than with the modelled data ( Table 2 ). This suggests that we have in fact underestimated the number of predicted reinfections in our model; as no documented reinfection cases have been reported this strongly supports our conclusion that initial SARS-CoV-2 infection is effective at preventing reinfection in the short term.",

To investigate a more life-like recovery rate, the United Kingdom simulations were repeated again using the modelled recovery data, while shortening the lag time for recovery. As expected, we found that the rate of reinfection was increased as the lag time was decreased from 28 days through to 7 days, as there was a larger population that recovered from a primary infection. With a 7-day lag time, the number of people in the infected (2 or more times) state peaked at around day 100 of the simulation ( Figure S1 ). The total number of people reinfected throughout the simulation increased with a decreasing lag time, with 70\u00b18, 121\u00b111, 187\u00b114 and 267\u00b116 reinfections for 28-day, 21-day, 14-day and 7-day recovery lag times respectively. With a median recovery time of one to two weeks for mild cases [21] , the 7-day or 14-day lag times represent more realistic figures for the recovery rate. It is therefore extremely unlikely that the large number of reinfections that these lag times suggest would have been missed, and so we conclude that initial infection results in immunity against SARS-CoV-2. reuse, remix, or adapt this material for any purpose without crediting the original authors. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) in the Public Domain.

We modelled actual infection and fatality data from different regions and countries around the world and found that all regions investigated, with the exception of Australia, should have recorded cases of reinfections if primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 did not provide some level of immunity. Australia may be an exception as the country was relatively quick to adopt early social distancing measures such as mass testing and contact tracing, as well as preventing international travel from high risk countries [25] . We also found that rehospitalisation cases should have been seen amongst hospitalised cases in New York City. To date, however, no reinfections have verifiably been recorded anywhere in the world. A report from South Korea suggested that 116 patients recovered from COVID-19 had tested positive by RT-PCR for the virus again [26] , however, this has since been explained as the 'false-positive' detection of remnants of viral RNA rather than reactivation or reinfection. The lack of documented reinfections suggests that short-term immunity to the virus is produced by an initial infection, however, our model cannot predict whether this immunity will last over longer time scales.",

Comparison with realworld recovery data from Germany suggested that the actual recovery time may be significantly shorter, giving rise to an underestimation of the reinfection rate in our modelled data. This was supported by an increase in the number of predicted reinfections in the United Kingdom simulations when we used a shorter recovery lag time of 7, 14 or 21 days. In addition, there were no allowances in our model for transmission being localised to regions smaller than a nation or state; the daily infection data was likely to be only a fraction of the total number of infections due to asymptomatic or mild infections not being recorded, and infections were recorded on the date of testing, not the actual date of infection. We also note that significant differences in testing, reporting and shielding of the vulnerable exist between the different regions in this study. In every region, we expect that the impact on our simulation would be to underestimate the number of reinfections, though these differences mean direct comparisons between countries are not valid. Taken together, this suggests that the actual reinfection rate would be significantly higher than that predicted by our model if there was no immunity conferred by prior infection.",
