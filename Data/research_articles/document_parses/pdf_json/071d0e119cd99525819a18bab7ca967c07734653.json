This article reviews extant perspectives of health as capital, reflecting upon how a conceptualization of health capital might be conceived by two of the main contrasting traditions: human capital theory affiliated with the Chicago School of Economics and Bourdieusian concepts of social field and capital. Arguing that a Bourdieusian perspective is potentially more fruitful to capture the importance of social and cultural dimensions in the construction of individual health, this article arrives at a conceptualization of health capital as the aggregate of the actual or potential resources possessed by a given agent that have the capacity to affect the position of agents in the social field of health. Drawing on Bourdieu's conceptualization of forms of capital, this article discusses the efficacy, the legitimation, and the positioning of health capital, uncovering its potential for understanding contemporary trends in health practices and health discourse.",

            "text": "The idea of relating the health of an individual to capital goes back to debates in political economy starting with Mushkin's (1962) view of health as an investment and Becker's (1964) view of health as a part of human capital. Grossman (1972) builds on these perspectives and introduces the term \"health capital\" as part of a model of the demand for the commodity \"good health.\" This model views health as a \"durable capital stock that produces an output of healthy time\" (Grossman 1972, p. 246 ) and depreciates with age, but that can be invested in through medical treatments. Grossman (1972) argues for health capital being different from other forms of human capital: instead of focusing on increasing worker productivity, health capital focuses on life-long earnings by viewing health as both a \"consumption commodity\" directly entering consumers' \"preference function\" and an \"investment commodity\" resulting in a larger amount of time available for \"producing money earnings and commodities\" (Grossman 1972, p. 225) . Sick days incur an \"opportunity cost of the time that must be withdrawn from competing.\" Grossman's (1972) health capital and the associated model of the demand for health have spawned one of today's main recognized paths of research into the economics of health. The field of health economics is predominantly focused on studying the functioning of the healthcare system and ways of improving health policies. Grossman's model and its successors provide numerical tools for studying individual health from a statistical perspective, where the individual is a tiny mechanical part of the macro-level healthcare apparatus.",

Grossman would refer to health capital in this sense as an investment commodity. While health capital clearly could be an asset in the production of market goods and other commodities, the construction of individual health could also be viewed as an end in itself. In this sense, it could be viewed as the outcome of the production processes of the consumption commodity health capital driven by the \"fundamental demand for 'good health'\" (Grossman 1972, p. 248) .

Health capital as a conceptual framework for understanding the construction of individual health could be viewed as task-specific at different scales: from tasks such as the patient-specific day-to-day management of chronic illnesses like diabetes (Scambler et al. 2014 ) to more general tasks such as the prevention of lifestyle diseases through individual exercise and dieting advocated by health promotion campaigns (Ayo 2012) .",

The agents strive for social distinction within the field, accumulating symbolic capital in the form of recognition and status. This symbolic capital complements the economic, social, and cultural capital that shapes their class belongingness. Class and status, in turn, structure the agents' capacities and dispositions. Bourdieu (1986) views capital as accumulated labor that has the capacity to affect the social positions of agents in a field. Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) introduce the notion of \"field-dependency\" of capital to signify how capital determines the social positions of the agents within a given field depends on the specific rules and relations of that field. This could open up for understanding health capital as field-dependent capital, determining the social positions of the agents within the social field of health. Here, the social field of health includes not only institutionalized health encounters in the form of interactions between patients and health professionals but also individuals' everyday health practices outside of institutionalized contexts. Health capital could then be viewed as a unique form of capital different from but drawing upon the synergy of economic, social, cultural, and symbolic capital contextualized to the social field of health.",

It could provide not only an opportunity for a deep investigation of the how but also the potential to explain the why in the construction of individual health by considering the symbolic aspects of capitals. Bourdieu (1987, p. 4 ) defines symbolic capital as \"the form that the various species of capital assume when they are perceived and recognized as legitimate.\" While social and symbolic capital are inherently \"very strongly correlated\" (Bourdieu 1987, p. 4) , Bourdieu (1986, p. 49 ) also postulates that the \"transmission and acquisition\" of cultural capital \"are more disguised than those of economic capital\" and that \"it is predisposed to function as symbolic capital.\" By this, he refers to cultural capital often not being recognized as capital, but as \"legitimate competence, as authority exerting an effect of (mis)recognition.\"",

The following sections will use this perspective to explore and discuss the efficacy, the legitimation, and the proper place for health capital through reflection on socially and culturally embedded mass-cultural trends in the increasingly complex and individualized social field of health. Bourdieu (1986, pp. 53-54) discusses the efficacy of different forms of capital, postulating that social and cultural capital \"can be derived from economic capital, but only at the cost of a more or less great effort of transformation, which is needed to produce the type of power effective in the field in question.\" The effort required to leverage economic capital as health capital and, thereby, the efficacy of health capital is likewise field-dependent, as the rules of the field and the dispositions of the agents differ significantly from one context to another. One would, for example, expect a higher degree of convertibility in predominantly privately organized healthcare systems such as the one of the United States compared to tax-financed egalitarian systems such as the Danish one, where healthcare is virtually free and the market for privately paid medical services only fills a small niche (Saunders 1995) .",

The entailing increase in self-efficacy and empowerment is at odds with the dominating force relationships in the healthcare field, which are built on institutionalized professional care and the expert status of health professionals.

The legitimation of health capital by proto-professional peers within such a \"filter bubble\" (Pariser 2012) has, for example, given rise to the phenomenon of anti-vaccination movements (Goldenberg 2019) , which is challenging public health on a global scale.",

First, health capital does not presuppose an institutionalized context such as health encounters but also provides a means for understanding everyday health practices that do not involve health professionals in prominent roles or at all. Second, by integrating social and economic resources and symbolic aspects on an equal footing with cultural ones, health capital allows exploring their effect without having to consider them mediated through transformation to cultural capital. While cultural capital in the form of medical knowledge and communication skills are naturally dominant in health encounters, other forms of capital such as social capital in the form of social density (Turner 2003 ) play a significant role in a broad spectrum of everyday health practices.",

Health capital allows understanding the observed heterogeneity by considering that individuals differ regarding their health capital and, consequently, perform widely varied everyday health practices and react differently on efforts to strengthen their health literacy and self-efficacy. Instead of targeting patients exclusively by shared medical conditions-as customary in empowerment initiatives-taking individuals' social, cultural, and economic background into account has the potential to improve the outcome of such initiatives.",
