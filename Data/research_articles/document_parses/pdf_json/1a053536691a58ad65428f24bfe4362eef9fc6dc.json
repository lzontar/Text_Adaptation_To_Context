            "text": "The reproduction number, R, is a key epidemiological parameter that quantifies the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual. When a pathogen emerges in an entirely susceptible population this parameter is referred to as the basic reproduction number, R0. When some population-level immunity exists, the parameter is referred to as the effective reproduction number, Re. These reproduction numbers provide valuable information about a pathogen's potential for spread in a population and the associated implications for control efforts (1-3). Reproduction number estimates for any one pathogen are time and context specific, with factors such as contact patterns, population immunity, and behavioral change contributing to variability in these estimates (4, 5) . For these reasons, the reproduction number is usually monitored over time to track the progress of an outbreak. The instantaneous reproduction number, Rt, estimates the average number of secondary infections generated by an infected individual at time t and sequential estimates over the course of an outbreak can provide valuable insights into the need for interventions and/or the effectiveness of control programmes already in place.",

            "text": "Numerous mathematical and statistical methods have been developed to estimate the reproduction number of an emerging pathogen (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . The choice of method to be used largely depends on the available data, with more data typically allowing the parameterization and use of more complex methods. However, in the early stages of an outbreak, epidemiological data are often sparse and highly uncertain. In the case of emerging pathogens, data can be particularly limited, as surveillance systems may be unprepared for the detection and reporting of a new pathogen. In addition, limited understanding of the dynamics of a new pathogen can often inhibit the parameterization and use of more complex transmission models. This has particularly been the case for SARS-CoV-2, which was first reported in China in December 2019 and has since reached more than 200 countries and territories, as of May 2020 (13) . Though new evidence is rapidly emerging on aspects of transmission dynamics such as generation intervals and the proportion of asymptomatic infections (14) , many uncertainties remain, including the duration of immunity, the role of seasonality on transmission and the effects of immunological cross-reactivity with endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV). Incorporating such uncertainties into mechanistic models of transmission can prove challenging in early outbreak contexts, where statistical methods are often the only available tool to infer the level of transmission from a limited amount of data, such as a time series of reported case numbers. Quantifying local transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2 has been, and will continue to be, critical for guiding the pandemic response (15) (16) (17) (18) . Understanding the accuracy and limitations of these methods in the context of real-time outbreak analysis scenarios is crucial in order to optimally inform outbreak response activities, including the need for new control efforts or the relaxation of efforts already in place.",

Estimates of R0 were frequently over-estimated at all time points assessed, the magnitude of which was generally greater for higher values of actual R0 ( Figure S2 ). As expected, higher values of R0 used for data simulation generally resulted in epidemics that peaked at earlier time points, subsequently resulting in a reduction in the number of epidemic simulations where the growth phase continues beyond 9, 12, 15, etc., weeks, and an under-representation of high R0 simulations at the later epidemic stages assessed ( Figure S2 ).

For epidemic simulations with Poisson noise, mean absolute bias ranged from 0.88 (linear exponential growth) to 1.64 (Wallinga and Teunis) at 6 weeks and from 0.36 (Poisson and maximum-likelihood exponential growth) to 0.49 (linear exponential growth) at 15 weeks. Similarly, for epidemic simulations with negative binomial noise, mean absolute bias ranged from 1.07 (linear exponential growth) to 2.60 (Wallinga and Teunis) at 6 weeks and from 0.48 (Poisson exponential growth) to 0.80 (Wallinga and Teunis) at 15 weeks. The relationship between estimated R0 and actual R0 for individual simulations by method and time point are shown in Figures S3-S5 for the scenarios of data with no added noise, Poisson noise and negative binomial noise, respectively.",

Estimates of R0 obtained for the earliest stages of the epidemic assessed in this analysis (i.e. at 6 and 9 weeks, corresponding to approximately 2 and 3 generation time intervals respectively) were associated with larger bias and uncertainty for all methods assessed. Using simulated epidemic data, we found that estimates of R0 frequently overestimated the actual R0 value used in the simulation process, particularly in the early fitting stages, 6 and 9 weeks, even when the true case time series (i.e. a constant proportion of infected individuals that is accurately detected and reported) is observed.

The trend of decreasing average R0 estimated in the early stages of epidemic growth was also observed for some countries when fitting to national case surveillance data from the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean (e.g. French Guyana, Martinique, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as shown in Figure 3 ). The limited efficacy of existing interventions against vector-borne pathogens such as Zika suggest the possibility that methodological bias could explain these trends rather than reductions in transmission at that time. In addition, early analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China estimated a declining trend in the reproduction number from 7.93 (95% CI: 5.00-12.00) on the 29 th December 2019 to 2.60 (95% CI: 0.57-5.17) on the 18 th January 2020 using the Wallinga and Teunis method, attributing this reduction to the effectiveness of prevention and control measures taken at that time (21) . However, the largest decrease in R estimated by Liu et al., was observed between the 29 th of December and the 2 nd of January 2020, prior to the implementation of significant interventions, from which point the estimates of R largely stabilised for the remainder of the period of estimation (21) . Apparent trends of decreasing R0 during early epidemic growth can potentially be misinterpreted as larger-than-actual decreases in pathogen transmissibility, which may lead to overestimation of the potential impact of interventions and longer than expected times to epidemic extinction. Awareness of this bias is crucial for estimating transmissibility in the early stages of an epidemic and accurately interpreting the subsequent implications for control (22) .",

As countries expand surveillance systems to better manage the pandemic, the assumption of constant reporting of cases implicit in these methods likely do not hold true until the capacity of the surveillance system has stabilised, and a consistent case definition is applied. In these contexts, whilst testing capacity is growing, the use of hospital admission or death data, where available, may be preferable for inferring R0 if the reporting of these data is believed to be constant in time. Delays in the time from infection to hospitalisation and/or death, however, result in significant lags between when the transmission events occur and when they can be quantified.

We observed varying strengths and limitations associated with each of the methods considered here and the sensitivity of these factors to levels of random noise and the amount of available data. While the linear exponential growth rate method performed poorest in terms of coverage of actual R0 values when fit to simulated data with no added noise, it had the highest coverage of actual R0 values when fit to data with added random noise, driven by increased confidence interval widths in the presence of overdispersion.

There are a number of limitations in our analysis, including the simplicity inherent in the assumptions of homogenous mixing in fully susceptible and closed populations that were used to simulate the case data. These assumptions do not reproduce the sub-exponential growth dynamics that can occur in empirical epidemics as driven by complex spatial structures, local contact networks and other sociobehavioural factors not accounted for in this analysis (24, 25) . The results of this analysis are based on weekly epidemic case-time series, which may not fully reflect results obtained when daily case reports are available. However, whilst the larger number of datapoints provided by daily time series may potentially improve methodological performance in the early epidemic stages, daily case counts may be subject to increased errors/overdispersion and substantial day-of-the-week effects. In addition, noise was added to the case time series in the form of random errors to reflect stochasticity in the infection and reporting processes, inherently assuming the noise to be random. Systematic forms of noise/bias, such as reporting delays, changes in health-seeking behaviour or case definitions, incorrect generation time assumptions etc., are not accounted for in this analysis. Here, we show that R0 estimates frequently overestimate the actual R0 values even when the true case time series is observed (i.e. a constant proportion of infections that is accurately detected and reported), when the true generation time is known, and when the assumption of exponential growth is met (both in the simulation model and in the estimation method).",

We show how the performance of these methods can vary over time when fit to increasing amounts of case data, in line with a real-time outbreak analysis scenario, and demonstrate the sensitivity of methodological performance to varying levels of random noise in the data. This has important implications for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as we show that true changes in transmissibility in the early stages of epidemic growth may be difficult to disentangle from changes in methodological accuracy and precision, particularly for data with significant overdispersion. Cautious interpretation is warranted when using these methods to infer transmission patterns in the early stages of epidemic growth, as apparent declines in R0 estimates may be mis-attributed to the effectiveness of control efforts and lead to incorrect conclusions about the course of the epidemic. Several generations of pathogen transmission may need to be observed for accurate R0 estimation by these methods. An awareness of this trend in bias over time is crucial for appropriate interpretation of R0 estimates and any subsequent implications for the planning of outbreak response activities.",

We assumed there was no transmission before the onset of symptoms. We also assumed entirely susceptible closed populations with randomly selected sizes ranging in multiples of 10, from 10 3 to 10 6 , and assumed homogenous mixing in the population. The epidemic was seeded with a random number of between 1 and 5 initially infected individuals. Daily incidence data were simulated for a period of 2 years which was then aggregated to weekly data for consistency with the empirical data reported during the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean. We assumed that 20% of all infections resulted in reported case-notifications which was constant over time. 250 unmitigated epidemic simulations were generated, each of which was fitted to under 3 different scenarios of random noise -no noise, mild noise and high noise. To represent stochasticity in the reporting and infection processes underlying the observed case incidence, Poisson (mild noise) and negative binomial (high noise, dispersion parameter=3) distributed random errors were separately added to the simulated epidemic.",
