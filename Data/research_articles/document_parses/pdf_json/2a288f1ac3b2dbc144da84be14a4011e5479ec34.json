Currently, lung-protective ventilation strategies, including open lung and low-tidal-volume, are among the major ARDS mechanical ventilation strategies to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury for both adults and children [1] . Despite advancements in our understanding of lung-protective low-tidal-volume ventilation, the mortality associated with pediatric ARDS remains high and has changed little in the last 20 years (22-40%) [2, 3] . No consensus has been reached on the optimal mode of ventilation for pediatric ARDS patients refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) using low tidal volume combined with sufficient positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). Over the past 3 decades, such patients have commonly transitioned from CMV to high frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV) for refractory hypoxemia or to limit cyclic high peak pressures [1] .

However, until recently, it was not widely used as a rescue mode for the difficult-to-oxygenate patient with ARDS. As the name suggests, APRV mode has been described as a continuous positive airway pressure with a brief intermittent release phase allowing the release of only partial lung volume. In adult patients with ARDS, compared with other conventional ventilatory modes, APRV may improve oxygenation due to increased recruitment of lung volumes, length of stay in the intensive care unit and ventilator-free days [5, 6] . Until 2018, pediatric research on APRV was restricted to case reports, case series and prospective crossover studies [7] . A recent study by Lalgudi Ganesan et al.

The trial was terminated early after 50% enrolment when the analysis demonstrated a trend toward higher mortality in the APRV group compared with the conventional low-tidal volume ventilation.

Determination of failure of CMV and the decision to employ alternative modes was left to the discretion of the attending intensive care physician. Despite the lack of a standardized ventilator protocol, the authors' institutional practice for ARDS is to initiate CMV with a minimum of 5 cm H 2 O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), low tidal volume (6-8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and to attempt to wean FiO 2 to \u22640.60.

The main findings of this study were that in a cohort of pediatric patients with severe ARDS, when CMV did not achieve a specific target level of oxygenation, initiation of APRV was able to significantly and sustainably improve oxygenation. Inverse ratio ventilation (IRV), HFOV and APRV are non-conventional modes of ventilation considered as a rescue treatment for patients with moderate to severe ARDS who are refractory to CMV [11, 12] . All these nonconventional modes increase oxygenation by increasing the average P aw [13] . In the current study, when transfer was made from CMV to APRV mode, the average P aw increased significantly. As the inspiration duration is relatively much longer than the expirium duration in both IRV and APRV, the duration at high pressure in the respiratory cycle is prolonged, causing elevation in the P aw values.
