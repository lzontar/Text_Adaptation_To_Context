Among hypertensive patients, ACEI/ARB used appeared to be associated with lower mortality compared to patients not taking ACEI/ARB. Currently available data from observational studies have shown contrasting findings regarding relationship between ACEI/ARB use and outcomes in Covid-19 patients. In a study of 1128 hospitalized patients with HTN, Zhang et al showed that inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with decreased risk of mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users [6] . However, Reynolds et al found no significant association between use of ACEI/ARB and risk of developing critical illness among those tested positive for Covid-19 [7] . Similarly, ACEI/ARB use was not associated with risk of in-hospital mortality in a large multicenter study of hospitalized Covid-19 patients [10] . On the contrary, there was increased percentage of patients admitted to ICU in the ACEI/ARB group compared with non-users in a large multi-center study [11] .",

We also noted lower proportion of severe illness in ACEI/ARB group compared with non ACEI/ARB group among the HTN patients, although this didn't reach statistical significance. However, these associations in HTN sub-group are hypothesis generating and should be interpreted cautiously as the analysis was based on studies limited to 1,895 patients.

Significant heterogeneity was noted across the studies (I 2 =65% for mortality and I 2 =77% for severe illness). No single study influenced results or heterogeneity in sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analysis comprising only patients with HTN showed reduced risk of mortality in patients on ACEI/ARB when compared with those not on ACEI/ARB [0.64 (0.45-0.89); p=0.01]. In terms of severe illness, no significance was observed in trend between ACEI/ARB users vs. non-ACEI/ARB users [0.76 (0.52-1.12); p=0.16] (Figure 2).",
