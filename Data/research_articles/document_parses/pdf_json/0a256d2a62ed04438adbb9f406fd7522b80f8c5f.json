Detection of individuals at high risk for critical condition is crucial for control of the disease. Herein, for the first time, we profiled and analyzed plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of mild and severe COVID-19 patients. We found that in comparison between mild and severe COVID-19 patients, Interleukin-37 signaling was one of the most relevant pathways; top significantly altered genes included POTEH, FAM27C, SPATA48, which were mostly expressed in prostate and testis; adrenal glands, small intestines and liver were tissues presenting most differentially expressed genes. Our data thus revealed potential tissue involvement, provided insights into mechanism on COVID-19 progression, and highlighted utility of cfDNA as a noninvasive biomarker for disease severity inspections.",

We investigated gene expression pattern in cfDNA via analyzing the sequencing depth-normalized, relative coverage of the promoters. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the relative coverage around promoters of known genes on the two time-course data sets and controls (Fig.  1) . Six gene clusters showing significantly different patterns between mild and severe cases were identified ( Fig. 1A and Fig. 1C) . Notably, the average coverage around gene promoters from cluster 2 and 6 decreased along hospitalization time line for the severe case (suggesting upregulation of these genes), while such pattern did not exist in mild case (Fig. 1A) , indicating that the genes involved in disease course could be different in mild and severe cases.",

Cluster 2 shows a clear trend of increased expression in the severe case, especially at the last three time points; significantly enriched pathways in this cluster include cytosolic sulfonation of small molecules (p = 0.009) and RUNX1 regulates genes involved in megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet function (p = 0.01), which is in accordance with the dropping platelet counts from clinical laboratory records of the severe case (Table 1 ). Cluster 6, which showed similar trend with cluster 2, involves Ub-specific processing proteases (p = 2.8\u00d710 -9 ) and deubiquitination pathways (p = 3.3\u00d710 -9 ), which are commonly hijacked by viruses for replication and pathogenesis, and were reported containing druggable targets to treat COVID-19 (22) . Other enriched pathways include olfactory signaling pathway (p = 0.003), G alpha (s) signaling events (p = 0.006), signal regulatory protein family interactions (p = 4.5\u00d710 -7 ), and cell-cell communication (p = 2.3\u00d710 -4 ), which are expected given inflammatory and immune responses in severe COVID-19.",

We laid emphasis on differences between mild and severe cases, while not significant either between cases and controls, or within controls. Table 2 lists top 10 genes out of all significantly differentially expressed genes ( Fig. 2A and Table S4 ), and the coverage pattern around the promoters of the top 10 genes were shown in Fig. S2 . Strikingly, the top 3 genes, namely POTEH (Prostate, Ovary, Testis-Expressed Protein On Chromosome 22), MGC39584 (Family With Sequence Similarity 27 Member C), and C7orf72 (Spermatogenesis Associated 48) are all highly linked to male gender: POTEH and MGC39584 are specifically expressed in prostate and testis, and C7orf72 is associated to spermatogenesis (23) . The significant difference of genes related to male reproductive system are corroborated by previous studies that claimed spermatogonia cells to be targets attacked by SARS-CoV-2 (24,25).
