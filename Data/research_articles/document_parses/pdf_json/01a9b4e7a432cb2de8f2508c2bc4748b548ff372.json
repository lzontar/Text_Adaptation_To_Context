While any age or breed of cat can develop FIP, FIP disproportionately affects pedigree kittens: most studies found that around 70% of FIP cases occurred in pure-bred cats under 2 years of age. In this paper, some questions about FCoV and FIP that are likely to be asked of, and by, a veterinary nurse will be addressed.",

Therefore, after the death of a cat to FIP, the litter tray can be disinfected using bleach, and soft furnishings can be steam-cleaned. To be 100% sure that all coronavirus has gone, wait 2 months before obtaining another cat. If there are already cats in the household who were in contact with the FIP cat, those cats should be tested for FCoV antibodies. It is important to use a sensitive test (i.e. one which doesn't give false negative results; for example the FCoV Immunocomb, Biogal, Israel (Addie, Boucraut-Baralon, et al., 2015) ) and the new cat or kitten should only be introduced after the existing cats have become seronegative, which can take some months to occur. The FCoV infection status of the new cat or kitten should also be established. An alternative option to FCoV antibody testing is to offer FCoV RT-PCR testing of faecal samples, which has become widely available. The advantages of FCoV RT-PCR tests are that they are able to differentiate cats who are actually shedding virus from those who were previously infected and have a residual antibody signal. One disadvantage is cost, which is higher than for antibody tests, plus there is a delay in getting results back from a reference laboratory. An advantage of FCoV antibody testing over RT-PCR is that a single negative FCoV antibody test rules out FCoV infection (provided the test is sufficiently sensitive and the cat is over 10 weeks old), whereas several monthly faecal RT-PCR tests must be performed to be confident of a negative result (Addie & Jarrett, 2001) . Where cat guardians are unable to reliably obtain faecal samples uncontaminated by the faeces of other cats in the household, viral RNA can also be detected on plain cotton rectal swabs (not in transport medium) performed by the veterinary surgeon or nurse.",

In the case of kittens, bear in mind that maternally derived antibodies to panleukopenia virus can persist until 20 weeks of age (Addie, Toth, Thompson, Greenwood, & Jarrett, 1998) and interfere with primary vaccination. The stress of a vaccine is not simply about the journey to the veterinary surgery and the procedure of giving an injection: the adjuvant contained within the vaccine is a major stressor to the immune system (Batista-Duharte, Portuondo, P\u00e9rez, & Carlos, 2014). If booster vaccination is essential, then use the least number of components possible, just core vaccines. For example, feline leukaemia (FeLV) vaccination is not core in countries such as the UK, where FeLV prevalence is under 1%, and in many cats' situations (e.g. indoor-only cats) (Lutz et al., 2009 ), but if it has to be given, then choose a non-adjuvanted vaccine, such as the recombinant canarypox FeLV vaccine (Purevax, Boehringer Ingelheim): such vaccines cause less inflammation and are likely safer in cats (Graf, Guscetti, Welle, Meier, & Pospischil, 2018) .",

Pedigree kittens are most at risk because unfortunately the majority of cat breeders don't wean kittens at 5-7 weeks of age and isolate them from adult cats and other kittens (who may be shedding virus), which would prevent kittens from becoming infected (Addie & Jarrett, 1992 ). In addition, kittens get infected at an early age, before their immune systems are fully developed. Posters, such as the one shown in Figure 3 , are available for educating the public about the dangers of buying a FCoV-infected pure-bred kitten. These posters can be downloaded, printed and put up in the practice waiting room (http://www.catvirus.com/Choosekitten. htm#Poster). If uninformed cat breeders were to experience consumer pressure to become FCoV-free, that would prevent a great deal of FIP from occurring.",
