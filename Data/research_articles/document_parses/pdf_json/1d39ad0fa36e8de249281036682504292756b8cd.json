Besides diseases because of traditional menaces such as cytomegalovirus and the Epstein-Barr virus, we have seen other viruses such as human herpes virus 6 and human herpes virus 8 emerge as problems for some transplant recipients. We have also experienced the occurrence of West Nile virus infection in transplant recipients (1) , an issue that will likely become more problematic in 2003 and beyond. While these infections are potentially devastating for transplant recipients, they share one important feature -namely transplant recipients do not represent a major vehicle by which infection is disseminated to others. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection represents a different threat -a threat that is characterized by grave consequences for the transplant recipient and the potential for transmission of infection to other patients, families and health care workers.",

This epidemiologic link takes into account the incubation period of SARS, which is usually up to 10 days (11) . Probable pediatric SARS cases have so far been shown to always have a well-defined epidemiologic link with disease in adult family members occurring before the onset of disease in the child.

Poor test sensitivity is a major factor limiting the utility of the currently available tests. \u2022 Infected transplant patients are expected to have a high viral burden and prolonged viral shedding which may facilitate transmission to other individuals. \u2022 Transplant programs should develop institutional appropriate screening of all patients, families and staff. Such screening may be part of the general hospital policy relating to patients, visitors and staff. \u2022 As we approach the forthcoming respiratory season, appropriate measures should be taken to review and upgrade infection control procedures in a variety of settings, including outpatient transplant clinics. \u2022 In the era of SARS, screening of donors and recipients should be modified to include clinical and epidemiologic information relevant to SARS. \u2022 Because of the unknown risk of transmission of SARS-CoV by organ transplantation, a conservative approach should be taken with respect to the evaluation and isolation of recipients who have received organs from donors from regions affected by SARS. Such an approach should take into account the likelihood that a donor may be within the SARS incubation period at the time of donation.
