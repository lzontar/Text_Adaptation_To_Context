In this cohort of previously healthy children, most of the infected with hMPV had mild or moderate symptoms, with no need of hospitalization. 20 Whereas a high-risk population has a greater chance of having a poor outcome with viruses that are usually associated with mild disease (ex: hMPV), it is possible that some respiratory viruses, such as RSV and ADV, are indeed causing more severe infections, irrespectively of health condition status.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 430, "end": 432, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Marguet et al, in a study evaluating the role of each respiratory virus in the severity of bronchiolitis, showed that young infants (median age 2.4 months), previously healthy, had a more severe presentation when RSV was causing the disease, compared to other respiratory viruses. On the other hand, when hMPV was causing bronchiolitis, there was a lower risk of prolonged hospital stay. 21 We observed significant clinical and demographic differences among the different etiologies in the infants with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. When RSV was the causative agent, patients had fewer comorbidities (p=0.004) and had a tendency of being younger (p=0.07) than patients with other viruses. Garcia et al in a publication of risk factors in 4,285 children hospitalized due to bronchiolitis, comparing RSV versus non-RSV cases, reported similar results, with more underlying diseases in the group without RSV (37.5% vs 27% of the RSV positives). 22 The detection rate of each of the respiratory viruses studied was similar to other studies that used comparable diagnostic methods and study population. 23, 24 We found a high prevalence of adenoviruses in our samples, corresponding for the second most frequent virus detected (27% of the positive samples). The frequency of adenoviruses varies in the different studies depending on population selected for screening and on the method applied for diagnosis. Studies that compare the sensitivity of the different diagnostic methods, demonstrated that PCR increased the number of positive cases by three to four times when compared to immunofluorescent assays. 25, 26 Nevertheless, local epidemiological characteristics, such as overcrowding or poor sanitary conditions, may be involved, considering the results published by Moura et al in Brazil, where 26.6% of the positive samples in children hospitalized with LRTI had an adenovirus. They screened for respiratory viruses in a hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo city, during the years of 1995 and 2000 using immunofluorescent assays. 27 Bezerra PGM et al., 28 also reported similar results in a surveillance study carried out in children under 5 years old in a Northeastern region in Brazil. They collected samples from 407 children (median age 8 months) including hospitalized and outpatients. RSV was the most frequent pathogen (37.3%), followed by adenovirus (24.8%) and hMPV (10.3%).

Several studies have demonstrated a reduction on hospitalization rates and mortality in high-risk patients that receive passive prophylaxis against RSV infection. 32, 33 In the last five years there was an extension in the inclusion criteria of these prophylaxes in Brazil, with major changes in 2014. Influenza vaccine was given to all children under 5 years of age, rather than the previous 2 years of age limit and palivizumab was incorporated as a national program and not limited any more to only a minority of the Brazilian states. These changes, probably a result of improvement in the respiratory virus surveillance system throughout the country that occurred as a response to the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 epidemic, promoted awareness to health care professionals and the population to these existing prophylaxes. Some studies already demonstrate an increment in the number of doses of influenza vaccine during the last five years. 14 Our study had some limitations. Samples were not screened for all of respiratory viruses known to cause lower respiratory tract infection in this age group, such as rhinovirus, other enteroviruses, coronaviruses and human bocavirus, which probably explains the low virus detection rate. Other respiratory pathogens that cause severe respiratory disease in young infants, such as Bordetella pertussis, were also not included. 34 Therefore, a broader diagnostic panel, including these agents, might have provided a more precise analysis. However, the viruses included in this study are wellestablished causes of respiratory infections, with low rates of viral coinfection and, except from adenoviruses, low rates of viral persistence, making it easier to compare the differences in etiology. 3 In conclusion, in this study we found that young age and underlying diseases are both independent risk factors for worse outcome in children hospitalized with a respiratory virus. Identification of this special population by health care professionals along with fast diagnosis of the viral nature of the disease, allow a more aggressive approach that may help to reduce morbidity and mortality in this group. Recent changes in Brazil, with broader access of the available prevention tools, through directed programs for high-risk population, will probably result in the reduction of severe respiratory infections in children. Future studies evaluating this new scenario are necessary to confirm the positive impact of these prophylaxes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 212, "end": 215, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 216, "end": 218, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 310, "end": 312, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 605, "end": 608, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 609, "end": 611, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1390, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1816, "end": 1818, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2181, "end": 2182, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Santa Casa de Miseric\u00f3 rdia Hospital and by the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.
