The latter belongs to the coronavirus group II. TGEV and PEDV are highly infectious and highly contagious enteric viruses of swine. PEDV and TGEV infections are considered difficult to distinguish clinically and also histopathologically [9] [10] [11] but can be distinguished by using modern, up-to-date techniques such as PCR and/or specific sequencing [12] . TGE is an economically important disease that might result in high mortality and was first described in the 1940s. While older animals generally recover by time, piglets under the age of three weeks usually die from the infection. The TGEV genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense 28.5-kb RNA. The viral membrane contains three transmembrane proteins: the S protein (220 kDa), M protein (29 to 36 kDa), and minor E protein (10-kDa). The S surface protein initiates the infection by binding to the cell surface. It also mediates the subsequent fusion between the viral and cellular membranes. The S protein binds to aminopeptidase N and to sialic acid. Aminopeptidase N binding is required for TGEV to initiate the infection of cells [13] .

Like other coronaviruses, TGEV is fragile and highly sensitive to disinfectants as further detailed in the chapter by Wolff et al. Epidemic peaks mostly occur during the cold season. After an incubation period of one to three days, symptoms of TGEV-associated disease emerge that include watery diarrhea, typical foul smelling yellowish-green feces that often contains flecks of undigested milk, vomiting, and loss of appetite. While the mortality rate is high in suckling piglets -up to 100% in piglets under two weeks of ageclinical symptoms in older piglets and adults are often mild and these animals will survive if especially their hydration status is adequate and ensured. The mortality rate is generally lower in these animals and will largely depend on additional factors such as secondary bacterial infections, cardiovascular decompensation, chilling and dampness. Outbreaks usually only last a couple of weeks with occurrence of specific neutralizing antibodies in mucosa, blood and milk. Further, lactating sows are highly susceptible. Clinical signs may include vomiting, severe diarrhea, malnutrition, and cease of lactation. In large herds the disease can persist for some time, often contributing to post-weaning diarrhea. The clinical symptoms of endemic/enzootic TGE are usually less severe in the older pigs, making a clinical differentiation between TGE and other infectious enteric diseases, like that caused by rotaviruses and/or clostridia, impossible. Upon histopathological examination, villous atrophy is frequently found in both rotaviral and enzootic TGE infections. Mixed infections are possible and underscore the importance of a strict disease management and/or prevention regimen. TGE represents a reportable disease also in EU member states. There is no specific treatment available yet, however, electrolytes, nursing and enhanced management of the piglets may reduce mortality and lethality. In smaller herds cross-suckling of affected piglets onto recovered sows would offer a biological treatment.

The most characteristic clinical sign of wet FIP is ascites. Other symptoms may be rather unspecific like swollen lymph nodes, ocular symptoms with conjunctivitis and/or corneal ulcers. As the name suggests, fluid accumulation is minimal in the dry form of FIP. Instead, other, rather unspecific symptoms dominate.
