It seems to have originated as a reaction to the well-meaning attempts by the profession to get widespread water fluoridation accepted as a public health measure to reduce the then epidemic incidence of caries. I have to admit to some sympathy for the argument that this is a violation of the right of people not to be subjected to compulsory medication. Despite this, there is now overwhelming evidence that fluoride is safe and highly effective and its concrete health benefits outweigh the rather abstract ethical argument. In the 1970s the opposition to fluoride exploded. You only have to look at some of the anti-fluoridationists' posters and adverts to see just how extreme the opposition was. Even scientists got in on the act. When the two researchers, Yiamouyiannis and Burk, 1 published their study (1977) supposedly establishing a link between fluoride and cancer, the scare went viral and was, it seems, lodged forever in the public's subconscious. No amount of academic rebuttal and comprehensive demolition of the junk science of Yiamouyiannis and Burk could ever eradicate it. It remains alive and well to this day, lurking in people's brains like a herpes simplex virus in a ganglion, emerging every now and again on the Internet to spread its damaging message into new minds.",

'Hi' she said with a grin, in response to my greeting and sat down in the chair for her yearly dental examination. She was a regular attender who had been coming for check-ups ever since she was a tot. It was a shock to discover a large carious cavity in her lower second primary molar. We were all shocked, Sophie, me and her Dad. What on earth could have gone wrong in such a low-risk patient? The usual investigations followed. No, Sophie was not especially fond of sweets. The family were very health conscious and ate an excellent diet. The children were scrupulous teeth brushers which they did twice a day. At last the 'F' word was mentioned. What sort of toothpaste did they use and did it contain fluoride? Actually, the Father admitted, they had changed to an herbal, fluoride-free paste about six months ago. He 'did not believe in fluoride' and was worried about possible health risks which he had heard about on the Internet.",

The toxic time bomb, 2 published in 1984, immediately became a best seller. It claimed that the mercury in dental amalgam was the cause of a wide variety of symptoms including headaches, nausea, brain damage, kidney disease, muscle weakness and digestive disorders. Dentists were besieged by patients asking to have all their amalgams removed and replaced with composite. Again no amount of reputable scientific studies was enough to kill this mind virus off and like fluoride it remains lodged in millions of brains and across the Internet. A family member called me not so long ago to ask if it was safe to have amalgams in their mouth. I have every sympathy with unfortunate sufferers of conditions like MS and ME who are desperate for a solution to their conventionally untreatable disease and who grasp at the possibility that amalgam removal may help. The fact that this is a damaging and expensive delusion is the sad truth.",

The 'age of doom' seemed to reach a peak in the 1990s and has been in slow decline since then, but it is inevitable that more scares will emerge, some of which will affect dentistry. To pursue the metaphor of the scare as a mind virus or 'meme' as Richard Dawkins would call it, 11 I believe the only effective strategy is to develop a herd immunity. As we have seen, academic rebuttals and scientific evidence, although essential, have limited effect. What is needed is for there to be a general awareness of the scare as a specific phenomenon and the fact that the overwhelming majority of them have turned out to be simply false. Far too often when the scare fails to deliver disaster we simply forget it and move on to the next one. Who now remembers the 'millennium bug' which caused a near panic in 1999 or the 'global cooling' scare of the 1970s? There needs to be a far greater willingness to hold the scaremongers to account and to remind the public of previous false alarms. In this way we can build up a general scepticism which will act as a counter to the tendency we all have to believe the worst.",
