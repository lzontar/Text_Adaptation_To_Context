Figure 1 shows the design of our model. Each cycle is one day in our model. The parameters used in the model were estimated based on the reported incidence released by the NHC of the People's Republic of China or recent investigation on the outbreak (Table 1 ). Daily reported incidence of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, death, and recovery in China is available from 11 January, 2020. [10] However, given that the probability of misdiagnosis is likely to be high in the early stage of the outbreak, we used the reported incidence between 0:00-24:00 on 25 Jan 2020 (the most updated data when the analysis was performed). The parameters included in the model were transition probabilities from one state to another in any given day. Briefly, we estimated the probability of being infected (Actual_infection_rate), the probability of being admitted to ICU if being a confirmed case (ICU_rate), and the probability of recovering from infection if being hospitalised (Recover_rate) according to the reported incidence and the total population in Wuhan. We further assumed that the probability of recovering from infection if not being hospitalised (SelfRecover_rate) would have been onethird of the Recover_rate. We also assumed that 2% of the confirmed cases admitted to isolation ward would experience deterioration of the symptoms and be admitted to ICU (ICU_After_Isolation). Probability of remaining in the ICU in the next day (ICU_cont) as estimated based on an assumption that a confirmed case can be discharged after receiving treatment for averagely 10 days in the ICU. We considered a 14% death rate among the hospitalised cases (Death_rate) according to the recent investigation by researchers from the University of Hong Kong. [11] Lastly, the report by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggests there were a total of 4,000 cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City (uncertainty range: 1,000 -9,700) by 18th January 2020. [12] Comparing to the number of cases released by the NHC of the People's Republic of China, this report suggests a diagnosis rate of less than 10%.
