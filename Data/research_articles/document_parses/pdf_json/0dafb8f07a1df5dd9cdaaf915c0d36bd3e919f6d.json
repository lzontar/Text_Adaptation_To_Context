The biosensor employs a single-strand deoxyoligonucleotides (ssDNA) probe, conjugated to immobilized gold nanoparticles on the core surface of an optical fiber. We explore the steric effects on hybridization affinity and limit of detection (LOD), by using different ssDNA probe designs and surface chemistries, including diluent molecules of different lengths in mixed self-assembled monolayers, ssDNA probes of different oligonucleotide lengths, ssDNA probes in different orientations to accommodate target oligonucleotides with a hybridization region located unevenly in the strand. Based on the optimized ssDNA probe design and surface chemistry, we achieved LOD at sub-nM level, which makes detection of target oligonucleotides as low as 1 fmol possible in the 10-\u00b5L sensor chip. Additionally, the FOPPR biosensor shows a good correlation in determining HLA-B27 mRNA, in extracted blood samples from patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), with the clinically accepted real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method.

The analysis of gene sequences and gene polymorphisms plays a fundamental role in numerous important applications, such as genetic disease diagnostics, molecular medicine, pathogen detection, genetically modified organism (GMO), drug screening, and forensics. As nucleic acid itself does not provide any signal, current methods of identification of specific DNA sequence in biological samples are based on isolation of double stranded (ds) genomic DNA and further polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the target sequence of DNA with an appropriate label. However, performing PCR protocols requires tedious procedures of hours, using sophisticated equipment in central laboratories, by skilled personnel, and thus, limits its applicability in becoming rapid point-of-care testing (POCT) methods.

Nevertheless, as shown in Table 3 , the LOD in the case, as shown in Figure 5c , is similar to, or slightly better, than that in the case as shown Figure 5a . This may be attributed to the larger size of the analyte, which causes larger change in local RI upon hybridization. To consider the steric effect when a target ssDNA has a length longer than the ssDNA probe, we divide this into two possibilities as shown in Figure 5b ,c, where the hybridization region is located unevenly in the target ssDNA. In this scenario, we separately thiolate the H5 ssDNA probe at either 3 -end to produce thiolated H5-3 ssDNA probe or 5 -end to produce thiolated H5-5 ssDNA probe so that the orientation of the immobilized ssDNA probes are opposite. As a result, the same 60-mer target ssDNA will bind with the two immobilized ssDNA probes in opposite directions, as shown in Figure 5b ,c. When H5-5 ssDNA probe, as shown in Figure 5b , is used, the longer fragment (not used for hybridization) becomes close to the surface and may cause more steric hindrance than when H5-3 ssDNA probe as shown in Figure 5c is used. Figure 7 shows a typical real-time FOPPR sensorgram, when H5-5 ssDNA probe was used to detect the 60-mer target ssDNA, at a concentration of 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 M. A response time of~650 s was observed. We carried out the binding affinity study as described in Section 3.2 to examine the binding constants and LODs in these two cases.
