Modified Buda scoring system for interstitial lung disease (ILD) was used to evaluate the severity and treatment effect of COVID-19 on ultrasonography. The differences between modified lung ultrasound (MLUS) score and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) Warrick score were analyzed to evaluate their correlation. COVID-19 showed the following sonographic features: thickening (12/12), blurred (9/12), discontinuous (6/12) pleural line; rocket sign (4/12), partially diffused B-line (12/12), completely diffused B-line (10/12), waterfall sign (4/12); C-line sign (5/12); pleural effusion (1/12), and pulmonary balloon (Am line, 1/12). The last two features were rarely seen. Differences of ultrasonic features, including lesion range, lung signs and pneumonia-related complications, between COVID-19 and CAP were statistically significant (P\uff1c0.05 or 0.001). MLUS scores (P=0.006) and HRCT Warrick scores (P=0.015) increased as the severity of COVID-19 increased. The differences between moderate [29.00(25.75-37.50)] and severe [43.00(38.75-47.25)] (P=0.022) or between moderate and critical [47.50(44.25-50.00)] (P=0.002) type COVID-19 were statistically significant, compared with those between severe and critical types. 3 Correlation between MLUS scores and HRCT Warrick scores was positive (r=0.54, P=0.048). MLUS scores (Z=2.61, P=0.009) and HRCT Warrick scores (Z=2.63, P=0.009) of five severe or critical COVID-19 patients significantly decreased as their conditions improved after treatment. The differences of sonographic features between COVID-19 and CAP patients were notable. The MLUS scoring system could be used to evaluate the severity and treatment effect of COVID-19.",

However, it is imperative to find out how to semi-quantitatively diagnose COVID-19 in an early stage and make a differential diagnosis from other types of pneumonia (Tsung et al. 2012 ). The histological changes in viral pneumonia are mainly characterized by interstitial lesions accompanied by lymphocyte infiltration, and often pulmonary interstitial fibrosis in the advanced stage (Shen et al. 2003) . Since ultrasound has been widely used in the diagnosis and differentiation of interstitial pulmonary abnormalities (Volpicelli et al. 2012; Lichtenstein 2014) , we hypothesized that ultrasound could be used to differentiate COVID-19 from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).",

The modified lung ultrasound (MLUS) scoring system used in this study was modified based on the ILD Buda scoring system (Buda et al. 2016) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) Warrick scoring system with a maximum score of 60 points (Table 3 ). The scoring system mainly consisted of three items: (1) pleural line involvement, including thickened, blurred, irregular or discontinuous pleural line; (2) lung parenchymal involvement, including B-line, partially diffused B-line, completely diffused B-line (white lung) and lung consolidation; (3) complications, including pneumothorax, emphysema, and pleural effusion. Pleural line, pulmonary parenchyma and complications were observed and 8 scored respectively in each section. There were 10 sections of bilateral lungs, the pleural line score less than 18 points, the lung score less than 34 points, the complication score less than 8 points.",

Many studies (Volpicelli et al. 2012; Lichtenstein 2014; Reissig et al. 2012; Alzahrani et al. 2017 ) have shown that ultrasound imaging is more sensitive than chest X-ray examination in the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (Mongodi et al. 2016 ) and CAP (Ho et al. 2015) . It can also make a sensitive diagnosis of viral pneumonia such as H1N1 or H7N9 earlier than chest X-ray examination (Ho et al. 2015; Testa et al. 2012 ) and thus has been recommended as an alternative screening method for such pneumonia in endemic 11 areas (Testa et al. 2012; Tsai et al. 2014; Lissaman et al. 2019). However, ultrasound identification between viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia remains a huge challenge. This study indicated that ultrasound was feasible in the diagnosis of COVID-19, and the ultrasound images were mainly manifested as B-line artifact, rocket sign, and partially or completely diffused B-line. Small consolidation and abnormal pleural line were detected in some cases. Noticeable differences in sonographic features were shown between COVID-19 and CAP. Ultrasound images of CAP were often manifested as large and circumscribed consolidation accompanied by bronchial gas phase or liquid phase, and pleural effusion was more common in CAP patients while their lung lesions were, to some extent, limitedly distributed when compared with those of COVID-19 patients. Consolidations were more extensive in bacterial pneumonia because a large number of fibrinogens permeated out from blood vessel to alveoli as the permeability of the blood vessel increased. Lung tissue was completely degassed and performed as a solid tissue echo in ultrasound which was described as varying sizes of \"hepatic-like changes\". Consolidations usually occurred in lung segment or sub-segment and might be accompanied by bronchial gas phase or liquid phase. Viral pneumonia such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was histologically characterized by interstitial pneumonia with lymphocytes infiltration.",

Viral pneumonia could be easily distinguished from bacterial pneumonia by ultrasound with the pathological differences. A limited number of studies (Tsung et al. 2012) showed that the pathologic features of COVID-19 were mainly manifested by diffused interstitial inflammation alveolar damage, including apoptosis and shedding of alveolar epithelial cells, formation of pulmonary hyaline membrane, obviously widened lobar space and infiltration of inflammatory cells composed of lymphocytes and monocytes. The similar pathological features among COVID-19, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Shen et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2020) were the pathological basis for the formation of lung ultrasound signs among patients with such diseases. The unique ultrasound signs of interstitial pneumonia included the disappearance of pleural line and the overlapping of B line, as well as white lung, waterfall sign, and small consolidations in severe patients with interstitial pneumonia. Combined with other studies, this study indicated that different viral pneumonias had the similar sonographic features, and there was still no evidence of obvious identification characteristics among them. However, compared with pulmonary edema and interstitial lung fibrosis, diffused B line or even waterfall sign were more commonly detected in COVID-19 patients. The reasons might be that the more severe pulmonary inflammation and more abundant mucus were conducive to the formation and fusion of B line in such patients (Volpicelli et al. 2012; Zeng et al. 2019a Zeng et al. , 2019b Zhu et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2020) .

To meet the clinical needs of emergency and critical care ultrasound, BLUE-plus protocol was adopted to assess COVID-19 interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Only 10 points (10 sections) were used for the observation of the pleural line, lung and thorax in the procedure, which significantly saved the evaluation time. Meanwhile, the Buda scoring system was modified (Table 1) patients. The results showed that the scores of lung abnormalities, calculated by the modified Buda scoring system, increased as the severity of COVID-19 increased, and there was a moderate correlation between MLUS scores and Warrick scores that were calculated by HRCT scoring method. Therefore, this new semi-quantitative pulmonary ultrasound assessment may be a viable approach for the evaluation of severity of interstitial pneumonia including COVID-19. Furthermore, the study suggested that this new semi-quantitative method can also be used to evaluate the treatment effects of methods (such as CT) for COVID-19 during the follow-up. It is worth mentioning that this study also indicated that the MLUS scoring system is better in distinguishing moderate group from severe or critical group, compared with HRCT which has an advantage in identifying severe or critical group. This should be emphasized in the clinical application of MLUS scoring system.",

All CAP patients underwent COVID-19 nucleic acid testing and showed negative results. Among the 20 cases, 10 had clear pathogenic evidence [pneumococcal pneumonia (6), gram-negative pneumonia (3), mycoplasma pneumonia (1)], 5 had pathological proofs confirmed by lung biopsy, 5 were clinically diagnosed with relieved symptoms and disappeared abnormalities on ultrasound and CT images after antibiotics therapy, and 3 had underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, respectively). The data were collected from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou Municipal Hospital, Jinjiang Municipal Hospital and the Affiliated Public Hospital of Quanzhou Medical College from December 2019 to February 2020. Lung ultrasound and chest CT examination Ultrasound instrument and examination Patients were examined by portable ultrasound diagnostic instruments in three versions: EDGE II (Sonosite, Washington, America) equipped with a 3.5-5 MHz convex array probe, s6pro (SonoScape, Shenzhen, China) equipped with a 2-5 MHz convex array probe, and Z6 (Mindray, Shenzhen, China) equipped with a 2-5 MHz convex array probe. Parameters and settings of imaging were optimized based on each individual scanning. To meet clinical urgent requirement, bedside lung ultrasound in emergency 7 (BLUE) protocol and BLUE-plus protocol were adopted for these patients to screen the lung at the upper BLUE-point, lower BLUE-point, phrenic point, posterolateral alveolar and/or pleural syndrome point (PLAPS-point), and posterior BLUE-point (Volpicelli et al. 2012). Thus, a total of 10 points were selected on both sides of the lung (Figure 1). Images of pleural line, lung parenchyma, and thoracic cavity at each point were recorded in each ultrasound section, along with 20 s of cine-loop. Lung ultrasound scanning was performed among CAP patients, at the upper BLUE-point, lower BLUE-point, phrenic point, PLAPS-point and posterior BLUE-point, in addition to the lesion areas (Volpicelli et al. 2012; Lichtenstein 2014).",
