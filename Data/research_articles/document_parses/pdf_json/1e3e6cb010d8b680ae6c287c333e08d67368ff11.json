There is some evidence that these measures were enforced and community mobility was significantly reduced (18). As the disease spread, drastic measures in Eastern European countries, and in the Western 'periphery' of Europe (Portugal), appear to have been more timely and effective in mitigating COVID-19 mortality. In the West, where the community circulation had initiated much earlier, the mid-March (or even later) measures were comparatively late and allowed a large mass of COVID-19 cases, building a critical reservoir of infection in the population.

Mortality and incidence rates decreased significantly for every day of delay till 50 days since 22 nd of January (that time interval point corresponds to March 11 th ). After that point, the gradient gets less steep and becomes non significant.Those countries in Europe which observed the earliest COVID-19 circulation, suffered the worst consequences in terms of health outcomes, specifically mortality. While only a matter of a few weeks difference, this time interval may have changed dramatically the reservoir of virus circulating in the community and thereby the trajectory of incident disease and resulting death. Getting to the first 100 cases depends also on seeding episodes. Large urban areas of Western Europe have more intensive global connection and a higher potential for more seeding events, which increased the chances of earlier community transmission in the country.Cumulative incidence and especially recorded mortality was the highest in countries that recorded sustained community circulation of SARS-Cov-2 before 11 th of March 2020, the date WHO declared COVID-19 a world pandemic. The least affected were those countries which recorded their first 100 COVID-19 cases after mid-March 2020.The longer the time it took to get to 100 cases, the easier to control the epidemic; the drastic, social isolation measures, undertaken in European countries, where community circulation of the infection started after March 11 th , seem to have been well-timed. This may explain their significantly lower COVID 19-related incidence and mortality compared with the Western European countries.On March 10 th and 11 th , the Italian government, the first in Europe, issued decrees(16,17) which introduced countrywide lockdown measures, limiting movement out of the home and banning a number of businesses (bars, retail shops etc). On March 20 th the measures were further tightened banning all non essential open air walking. During a short period, after the 11 th of March, most All rights reserved.
