Our initial sequence analyses communicated during the ongoing outbreak provided a preliminary idea of the molecular epidemiology, with outbreak viruses forming a homogeneous, monophyletic clade [17] . Paraphyly of concurrent viruses is expected when infections are independently acquired from a diversified source population such as expected in animal reservoirs. In Riyadh, concurrently circulating viruses were indeed distributed across at least 6 different clades, suggesting that these infections resulted from increased zoonotic activity or introduction of human viruses from other regions. One larger virus cluster was observed in Riyadh, associated with 1 specific hospital, suggesting nosocomial transmission (clade 2). The patient exported to Indiana had worked in this hospital, whereas the cases in the Netherlands were hospitalized in Madinah but not Riyadh [14, 15] .

These viruses may have been widely distributed in camels by late 2013 to early 2014, as they were detected in Taif (southeast of Jeddah) and in Qatar on the eastern Arabian Peninsula [16, 18] . Viruses encountered in Jeddah shortly before the outbreak such as Jeddah-1 or Jeddah_C6664 were clearly distinct, suggesting that the outbreak might have been initiated by the introduction of Jeddah-type viruses into camels in the region. The monophyly and similarity of outbreak viruses favors the idea that the subsequent transmission took place in humans. The regional restriction of outbreak viruses matches our earlier observation of low transmissibility between humans in nonnosocomial settings such as household contact clusters [19] . Despite a documented transmission from Jeddah to the capital, Riyadh, there was no evidence of further human-to-human spread in Riyadh. From the analysis of SNP patterns, it was concluded that all Jeddah-type viruses were homogenous, without evidence for concomitant circulation of other strains during the outbreak. Nevertheless, our preliminary sequencing studies found no relevant genetic changes sufficient to explain an altered epidemic pattern [17] . As we have now been able to isolate live viruses, we can provide a first sideby-side comparison of different viral strains of MERS-CoV. Of note, these virus isolates were representative of 2 likely nosocomial outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh, both causing international spread of the virus to the United States, the Netherlands, and Greece. Cell culture experiments yielded no evidence for changes in viral replication or immune escape. The absence of differences in serum neutralization disfavors antigenic variability as a promoter of transmissibility.

A subjective trend toward higher peak (but not average) concentrations later into the outbreak may be explained by increased disease awareness in hospitals, leading to an earlier investigation of suspected cases. Similar observations were made during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong where cases were detected with less delay after the outbreak had progressed for some time [20] .

This pattern is highly suggestive of an epidemiological hotspot where the virus is amplified and from where limited transmission chains are seeded. Indeed, KFH is the largest communal hospital in Jeddah and serves as the primary care center for all patients attending the Ministry of Health healthcare system, as well as for a large fraction of expatriate workers in the city. It is reassuring that the number of new cases in KFH declined toward the end of the study period. This trend started even before changes such as the closure of emergency rooms and the transfer of infected patients were implemented, pointing to the possibility that transmission may have been limited mainly by heightened awareness of the disease among healthcare workers and patients.

A low predictive value of clinical suspicion is caused by an insufficient case definition or lack of adherence to the case definition, as is suggested by a high fraction of tests in cases without a proper hospital registration number. Unjustified RT-PCR testing raises the likelihood of human error. As far as possible, we have assessed the technical capabilities of JRL and found no general issues of cross-contamination. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude issues elsewhere in the logistics chain, such as near the bedside where diagnostic samples may have been handled in bulk. The high similarity of all Jeddah-type viruses will make it impossible to resolve potential contamination sources retrospectively by sequencing of stored samples.
