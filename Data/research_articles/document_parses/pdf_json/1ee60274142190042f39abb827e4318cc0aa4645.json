COVID-19 is a highly infectious novel coronavirus which spreads via droplet transmission, causing a spectrum of disease from mild illness to severe bilateral pneumonia necessitating intensive care treatment. 1 While acute hospitals prepare for an influx of cases by increasing intensive care capacity and retraining staff, at the time of the events described here there was a lack of specific public health guidance for psychiatric services. In the following weeks, the Royal College of Psychiatrists produced COVID-19 guidance for the acute psychiatric setting and the National Association of Psychiatric Intensive Care and Low Secure Units has published guidance for management of acute disturbance in a psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. 2, 3 COVID-19 presents a unique challenge to the in-patient psychiatry setting owing to the nature of psychiatric illness and its treatment. The London PICU described here is a female, 10-bed locked ward comprising two corridors, each with five single bedrooms and two shared bathrooms. There is an extra care area, a seclusion suite, a communal area, including a dining room, and sensory, interview and clinical rooms. At the time of the outbreak, nine of the ten beds were occupied.

First, in those with serious mental disorder there is poorer management of physical health than in the general population, particularly comorbidities found to be prognosticators of COVID-19 disease severity: diabetes, hypertension, obesity and smoking. 4, 5 In addition, this patient cohort is often prescribed psychotropic medication that conveys an independent health risk, such as the cardiovascular and haematological risks associated with clozapine therapy, yet it is not fully understood whether this interacts with COVID-19 pathophysiology. 6 The management of behavioural disturbance in the context of COVID-19 was particularly challenging because of additional risks, which included: non-adherence to selfisolation procedures and physical health monitoring, the need for interventions such as restraint, rapid tranquillisation and one-to-one nursing. This huge challenge on the PICU contributed to the rapid transmission of COVID-19 between patients. Patients rarely maintained isolation measures and the enclosed layout of psychiatric in-patient wards makes it very difficult to follow social distancing and isolation procedures. There is one clinical room used for medical assessments, investigations and treatment administration. It is difficult to adapt this environment to meet the infection control standards needed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 while continuing to deliver safe and effective care to patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 377, "end": 379, "text": "4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 380, "end": 381, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 672, "end": 673, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The challenges facing acute psychiatric services"}, {"text": "Another challenge is that the mental health nursing workforce undergoes different training and registration from the general nursing workforce, limiting knowledge and experience in managing an acutely medically deteriorating patient. The patients on this PICU presented with a variety of symptoms, many had significantly deranged physical observations and complex comorbidity, yet did not meet the threshold for medical admission during this pandemic and so were treated on the PICU. As a result, their medical management was prioritised while also delivering effective psychiatric care. Many of the staff had little experience of the necessary high-level infection control procedures implemented to manage virus transmission, and this included PPE. This steep learning curve increased staff anxiety levels, potentially further contributing to sickness levels among staff.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The challenges facing acute psychiatric services"}, {"text": "Acute psychiatric services will face a number of ethical challenges over the coming months. During this pandemic many patients will be detained to in-patient units under the Mental Health Act 1983 for assessment and/or treatment of their mental disorder. If they become symptomatic for COVID-19 they will be expected to isolate in their room; when this is not adhered to how should it be enforced? Do we need to consider whether they fulfil the capacity criteria to make this decision? A patient's decision no longer affects only them: it also affects other patients, legally detained to the ward, unable to socially distance from the affected individual. The Coronavirus Act 2020 empowers public health officers to authorise initial restrictions to ensure assessment and screening for COVID-19, followed by up to 14 days' isolation. However, at present it is unclear how this will be implemented. The Mental Health Act allows for a detained individuals' liberty to be restricted in the context of their mental illness to protect themselves or others, but how should COVID-19 infection affect this? As clinicians and multidisciplinary team members, we are going to have to make difficult ethical decisions using the guidance and frameworks available to us, and our risk assessments must become more complex.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The challenges facing acute psychiatric services"}, {"text": "Although at the time of writing London is an epicentre for the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK, other acute mental health units will soon be facing similar situations, so it is important to share what has been learnt. All nine patients in this PICU tested positive for COVID-19: two had severe illness, with one requiring transfer to an acute hospital for treatment. One had moderate illness, five had mild illness, and one was asymptomatic at the point of testing but spiked a temperature on day 8. The proportion of severe illness was slightly higher than reported in the emerging global data, 5 despite the younger age range of the cohort. It is likely that the burden of medical comorbidity among the cohort is the reason for the higher prevalence of severe illness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 592, "end": 593, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary of learning"}, {"text": "As infection control measures were implemented from day 0, with staff utilising full PPE, it was assumed that transmission occurred between patients secondary to the index case.

The pace at which new processes were implemented is likely to have been beneficial. Weekly patient-facing ward rounds were suspended and daily multiprofessional meetings were held instead, followed by individual reviews. A risk mitigation plan was developed for each patient; this consisted of a minimum of 4-hourly physical observations, intermittent psychiatric observations plus intentional rounding, and a daily review of their physical status. Increased priority was given to physical health, with daily reviews of physical observations and paracetamol prescription, plus physical examination and phlebotomy where necessary. Before day 4, at which there could be cohorting of COVID-19-positive and -negative patients, medication and meals were taken to the isolating patients.

Encouraging patients to uphold self-isolation was challenging (Table 1) . To manage this, the ward was separated into COVID-19-negative and -positive corridors until all patients were confirmed positive. At the point from which the first case was suspected, patients were encouraged to wear masks to minimise transmission, given the poor adherence to self-isolation. Face-to-face assessments were limited to one interaction to prevent repeated staff exposure. Each interaction included all necessary interventions, including mental state assessment, physical examination and phlebotomy. Where physical restraint was indicated, personal protective equipment was worn, including a visor to protect from spitting, and the emergency response team was briefed about the nature of the risks. Zoning, segregation and seclusion were used to manage high-risk behaviours, but not solely as a means of preventing transmission. Where safe to do so, one-to-one nursing took place at the recommended 2 m distance. When rapid tranquillisation was required, consideration was given to the risk of respiratory decompensation in a COVID-19-positive patient. The guidance and understanding for managing COVID-19 in an acute psychiatric setting is evolving daily, and inevitably will have changed during the timeline of this article. However, the core principles on which clinical teams must base the difficult decisions ahead will remain. The Mental Health Act will remain clear in its remit, but use of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, Coronavirus Act 2020 and common law is likely to increase over the coming weeks when considering how to mitigate the additional and serious risk factors of COVID-19 in our patient cohort.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 193, "end": 202, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Summary of learning"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "World Health Organization.
