It can also be viewed in a stochastic framework, which is more realistic but also more complicated to analyze. In population dynamics, the deterministic models are developed with success in many situations. In these models appear some parameters and in concrete applications, its estimated values play a crucial role in the prediction of the studied system and even in the decision-making policies. Usually one considers that they are deterministic, but many times due to errors in measurements, variability in the populations, and other factors that introduce uncertainties, one can think of parameters as random variables. To consider these aspects, it is necessary to get some skills in probability theory, statistics, and differential equations. And the stochastic differential equation theory invites itself and fortunately there are many excellent books in this topics. For more details see for instance [14, 18, 15] . And with tools developed in this topic, interdisciplinary areas such as mathematical biology, biostatistics, and bio-engineering have become possible with rapid growth. There are interesting works done and the reader can see for example [12, 13, 16] and This work was completed with the support of the NLAGA project. arXiv:2004.13489v1 [q-bio.PE] 24 Apr 2020 references therein. Our aim in this work is one hand, to propose a stochastic model to analyze the pandemic of COVID-19. And on the other hand, we would like to deepen the numerical analysis of such phenomena in situations where the settings may be random. Many theoretical studies of the evolution of infectious diseases of the COVID-19 are recently proposed in [1, 4, 5, 6, 7] . In the simple SIR model, the total population for each country [3] is assumed to be constant and divided into three classes (susceptible, infected, and recovered). In the numerical simulations, we start with the deterministic case, following by the new proposed stochastic model in section 2, then 3 others SIR models and machine learning for forecasting where algorithms can include artificial neural networks, deep learning, association rules, decision trees, reinforcement learning and bayesian networks [20, 21] . First, we collect carefully the pandemic data from [2] , e.g. https://www.tableau. com/covid-19-coronavirus-data-resources, from January 21, 2020 to April 19, 2020 . After exploratory data analysis, we propose six (6) technics, a simple SIR model, a stochastic SIR with Brownian motion, SIR with Deaths, SIR with Fatal, SIR Exposed and Waiting cases with Fatal, and machine learning tools, to analyze the coronavirus pandemic in the worldwide. A special study is done for Senegal. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present a stochastic SIR model with the existence, uniqueness and some qualitative results. In section 3, we present approximation methods to estimate different parameters involving in the SIR models. It is followed by various numerical tests for comparative prediction.
