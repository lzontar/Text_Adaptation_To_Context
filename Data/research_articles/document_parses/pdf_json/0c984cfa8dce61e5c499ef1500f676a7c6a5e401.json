            "text": "The advent of immune checkpoint blockade antibodies has demonstrated that effective mobilization of T cell responses can cause tumor regression of metastatic cancers, although these responses are heterogeneous and restricted to certain histologic types of cancer. To enhance these responses, there has been renewed emphasis in developing effective cancer-specific vaccines to stimulate and direct T cell immunity to important oncologic targets, such as the oncogene human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), expressed in ~20% of breast cancers (BCs). Methods In our study, we explored the use of alternative antigen trafficking through use of a lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP) domain to enhance vaccine efficacy against HER2 and other model antigens in both in vitro and in vivo studies. results We found that inclusion of this domain in plasmid vaccines effectively trafficked antigens to endolysosomal compartments, resulting in enhanced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II presentation. Additionally, this augmented the expansion/ activation of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and also led to elevated levels of antigen-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells. Significantly, vaccination with HER2-LAMP produced tumor regression in ~30% of vaccinated mice with established tumors in an endogenous model of metastatic HER2+ BC, compared with 0% of HER2-WT vaccinated mice. This therapeutic benefit is associated with enhanced tumor infiltration of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Conclusions These data demonstrate the potential of using LAMP-based endolysosomal trafficking as a means to augment the generation of polyfunctional, antigenspecific T cells in order to improve antitumor therapeutic responses using cancer antigen vaccines.",

[1] [2] [3] Advanced HER2+ BCs can be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and HER2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), but these are not curative treatments for metastatic HER2+ BC. 1 2 Additional HER2 targeted treatments (such as small molecule inhibitors and the HER2-Antibody Drug Conjugate, T-DM1) also have efficacy in metastatic HER2+ BC but are not curative, thus more effective therapies for HER2+ BC are needed. 1 4 Although antigen loss or mutation are known mechanisms for therapeutic resistance, oncogenic HER2 expression remains elevated in therapy resistant cancers and is critical for their continued growth, making HER2 a compelling immunologic target. 1 2 5 In our previous studies, we developed HER2-specific viral vaccines encoding inactivated and truncated forms of HER2 6 7 which we used to stimulate HER2-specific immune responses in patients with advanced HER2+ BC. 6 These studies demonstrated that viral vaccines encoding truncated forms of HER2 could break HER2specific tolerance in HER2+ BC patients, with the induction of significant HER2-specific T cell memory responses in a subset of patients. Notably, we found that these HER2-specific memory responses were associated with enhanced progression-free survival. 6 As the HER2 specific immune responses were only observed in a subset of patients, we wanted to explore strategies to enhance immune responses to HER2, and considered genetic modifications to our vaccine.",

            "text": "One genetic strategy to enhance vaccineinduced, antigen-specific T cell responses Open access is by altering antigen trafficking to different subcellular compartments. [8] [9] [10] Lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) is a type 1 membrane protein possessing a short cytosolic C-terminus containing an endolysosomal targeting sequence. LAMP antigen targeting is a means to direct expressed antigens containing LAMP trafficking signals into the endolysosomal compartments and enhance MHC class II pathway presentation. 11 12 LAMP antigen trafficking circumvents the limitation of all nonexported proteins from viral and plasmid vaccines being routed to MHC class I pathways and enhances MHC class II presentation and subsequent stimulation of CD4+ T cell and B cell responses. 11 13 As MHC class II presentation has been linked to effective antitumor immunity 14 and CD4+ T cell responses associate with HER2-specific antitumor responses, [15] [16] [17] [18] LAMP-based vaccines have strong potential for use against HER2 and other cancer antigens. However, LAMP-based vaccines have been largely been used for pathogen targets, including HIV, HPV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), West Nile Virus, SARS, Hantavirus and Dengue virus. 11 12 19-24 These studies have collectively demonstrated an enhanced ability for LAMP vaccines to present antigens through the MHC class II pathway, resulting in improved pathogen-specific immune responses. More recent studies have used LAMP-based vaccines to skew immune responses to specific allergens, such as the Crly2 protein from Japanese Red Cedar pollen, toward a non-allergic Th1 response as a means to suppress IgE production. 25 26 Collectively, these studies suggest that integration of LAMP targeting into HER2 vaccines would enhance the induction of HER2-specific Th1 CD4 T cell responses, which may translate into more effective antitumor immunity. However, it was unclear if this strategy may be hampered by potentially altered or suppressed presentation through the MHC class I pathway, or if it would be sufficiently effective against non-pathogen antigens (that are subject to immune tolerance) to induce antitumor immunity.",

In the past, we explored the use of exosomal antigen trafficking and found that while it enhanced T cell and B cell responses to certain antigens, such as Carcinoembryonic Antigen, it did not strongly enhance responses compared with full length or truncated forms of HER2. 8 Due to our clinical success in HER2 vaccination, 6 we explored the endolysosomal trafficking of a HER2 vaccine through the incorporation of a LAMP trafficking motifs into a HER2 construct containing both the extracellular and intracellular domains (ECD/ICD) of the receptor. Our studies found that HER2-LAMP enhanced endolysosomal trafficking of HER2 compared with HER2-WT, which resulted in significantly decreased HER2 expression and enhanced both MHC class I and II presentation of LAMP-fusion peptides. This modification permitted greater early expansion of both antigenspecific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in draining lymph nodes, which translated into greater systemic immune responses, as demonstrated by superior induction of polyfunctional HER2-specific T cells after HER2-LAMP vaccination. The enhanced quantity and quality of HER2-specific T cell responses after HER2-LAMP vaccination allowed for more effective antitumor immunity, dependent on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Critically, HER2-LAMP vaccines produced significantly augmented antitumor responses against HER2 self-antigens, resulting in complete tumor regression in an aggressive endogenous model of HER2+ BC in a significant fraction of mice (~30%). This regression was associated with greater CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation within tumors of HER2-LAMP-vaccinated mice compared with tumors from HER2-WT-vaccinated mice. Thus, our study demonstrates that LAMP antigen trafficking can enhance T cell responses, producing expanded, multipotent HER2-specific T cells that enable effective antitumor immunity in a model of advanced HER2+ BC.",

To first test altered trafficking, we generated a series of LAMPtargeted and control constructs by adding an LAMP signaling sequence to the N-terminus and the LAMP ICD to the C-terminus (figure 1A). These genes were cloned into CMV-promoter expression plasmids and transfected to assess subcellular localization and trafficking by immunofluorescence microscopy. In these experiments, we noted an altered localization of HER2-LAMP in transfected 293 T cells, illustrated by a more intracellular distribution in contrast to the membrane-enriched distribution in native HER2-WT transfected cells ( figure 1B) . Colocalization studies revealed that HER2-LAMP significantly colocalized with native LAMP1 (figure 1C), lysosomes (figure 1D) and the ER (figure 1E), in comparison to HER2-WT. To determine if this altered trafficking depended on the transgene or cell type, we transfected OTI/II-GFP-LAMP and GFP into the dendritic cell (DC) line JAWSII. Colocalization studies of these cells again revealed that OTI/II-GFP-LAMP colocalized with native LAMP1 (figure 1F), lysosomes (figure 1G) and MHC class II (figure 1H) in comparison to an OTI/II-GFP control. To confirm altered cell surface trafficking of HER2, we also performed flow cytometry on 293T and RAW264.7 (macrophage) cells transfected with HER2-WT or HER2-LAMP ( Figure 1I , online supplementary S1A). We found that in both types of cells, HER2-LAMP had reduced cell surface expression compared with HER2-WT. In our microscopy and flow-based experiments, we also observed that LAMP vectors had reduced overall antigen expression intensity compared with control counterparts. To test if this altered trafficking led to reduced protein expression, we performed Western blot analysis on HER2 and HER2-LAMP transfected cells, as well as OVA-WT and OVA-LAMP transfected cells (figure 1J-K). We found that Open access although we could detect both proteins by Western blot, LAMP-targeted genes had significantly reduced levels of protein expression. We subsequently confirmed this by flow cytometry in GFP-WT and GFP-LAMP vectors, as well as by luciferase activity readings in cells transfected with luciferase-wild-type (LUC-WT) and LUC-LAMP vectors (online supplementary fig S1B-C) . For every antigen and detection strategy, we observed significantly reduced expression of LAMP variants, suggesting that altered cellular trafficking to lysosomes leads to differences in expression that might contribute to antigen presentation and lead to altered antigen-specific immunity.",

We vaccinated these mice using intramuscular electroporation with HER2-WT or HER2-LAMP plasmids and assessed HER2specific immune responses ( figure 2A) . Splenocytes from the vaccinated mice were restimulated with HER2 ECD and ICD peptides, and IFN\u03b3 production was measured by ELISPOT. HER2-LAMP vectors elicited significantly enhanced HER2-specific T cell responses (figure 2B), although not HER2-specific antibody responses to HER2 ECDs (online supplementary fig S2A) . To confirm these enhanced responses for HER2 were not impacted by HER2 signaling from our control plasmid (containing full length HER2) or due solely to our specific type of electroporation, we again repeated an intramuscular electroporation strategy (using a higher intensity single vaccination) using HER2-ECD-transmembrane (HER2-ECD-TM) and HER2-LAMP plasmids and assessed HER2-ECD-specific T cell and B cell responses. These experiments revealed that while HER2-ECD-TM could also elicit robust HER2-ECD-specific T-cell responses, HER2-LAMP again generated a significantly enhanced HER2-specific response ( figure 2C ). As before, we noted reduced HER2-specific antibody responses, suggesting that altering LAMP trafficking may have biased HER2specific immune responses towards Th1-type responses (online supplementary fig S2B) . As these altered T cell responses were likely a mixture of class I and class II presented peptides, we next used our OTI/II-GFP plasmids to interrogate if we could specifically alter class I and II specific peptide responses, using peptide-specific ELISPOT assays. Using the same electroporation strategy, we found that OTI/II-EGFP-LAMP vectors allowed for significantly enhanced IFN\u03b3 responses to SIINFEKL (OTI target) class I peptide and modestly improved IFN\u03b3 responses from an ISQVHAAHAEINEAGR (OTII-target) class II peptide, suggesting that LAMP trafficking can enrich for IFN\u03b3 responses against class I effector CD8+T cells ( figure 2D ). To further probe these differences, we used HER2-WT and HER2-LAMP plasmids with a homologous plasmid boosting strategy using intradermal electroporation to specifically enrich for DC targeting as previously described 31-34 ( figure 2E ). Using this strategy, we again found that HER2-LAMP vectors elicited significantly enhanced HER2-specific IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT responses compared with HER2-WT (figure 2F), along with diminished HER2-specific antibody responses (figure 2G). To assess differences in levels of polyfunctional HER2specific T cells, we restimulated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells from vaccinated mice with HER2 peptides and stained for intracellular IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1. These experiments revealed that while both vaccines could stimulate CD8+ and CD4+ HER2-specific cytokine responses, HER2-LAMP vectors elicited greater quantities of IFN\u03b3/TNF\u03b1 doubleproducing CD8+ T cells (figure 2H), but had no effect on CD4+ T cell cytokine production at day 28 postvaccination ( figure 2I ). These data demonstrate that vaccination with LAMP trafficking vectors results in enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses.",

Using this strategy, we isolated the draining lymph nodes at an early time point (3 days postvaccination) to assess how these vaccines affected the early expansion (CSFE lo ) and activation (CD44 hi ) of OVA-specific T cells. These experiments revealed a greater number of activated and expanded CD4+ OTII cells from OVA-LAMP vaccination in comparison to OVA-WT control vaccination ( figure 3B-C) . This suggested that altered OVA trafficking in sentinel cells leads to enhanced T cell stimulation, presumably through enhanced class II presentation.",

To determine class I presentation, we tested the ability of LAMP or control vectors to present SIINFEKL peptides to OTI-specific T cells from non-professional antigen presenting tumor cells. We stably transduced E0771 cells (a C57BL/6 BC line) with OTI/II-EGFP or OTI/II-EGFP-LAMP lentiviral vectors and performed coculture experiments with OTI CD8+ T cells. As before, we found that OTI/II-EGFP had significantly elevated expression of EGFP compared with OTI/ II-EGFP-LAMP (online supplementary fig S3) . Despite this expression difference, OTI CD8+ T cell coculturing experiments demonstrated significantly greater lysis of OTI/II-EGFP-LAMP expressing cells in comparison to controls, consistent with enhanced presentation of SIIN-FEKL through the class I pathway ( figure 3C) . Notably, we also observed enhanced secretion of IFN\u03b3 from these T cells, similar to what we had observed by ELISPOT in vaccinated mice ( figure 3D ). These studies suggested that enhanced class I presentation may also play a key role in LAMP-based vaccine efficacy. To formally test the contribution of class I and class II pathways on HER2-LAMP vaccine efficacy, we vaccinated mice deficient for class I (\u03b2M KO) and class II (MHCII KO) presentation pathways with HER2-LAMP in comparison to wild-type controls ( figure 3E) . These experiments demonstrated a modest, although significant reduction of HER2-specific T cell responses in MHCI KO mice, but ablated HER2-specific T cell and B cell responses in MHCII KO mice ( figure 3F ). This indicated that both pathways play roles in the induction of HER2-LAMP adaptive T cell responses, but that HER2-LAMP presentation through the MHC class II pathway is essential for HER2-specific T cell responses.",

To test this, we orthotopically implanted wild-type HER2-expressing TSA cells into the mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice and vaccinated with HER2-LAMP plasmid electroporation 1 day postimplantation (figure 4A). To determine the effect of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, we administered control, CD8 or CD4 depleting antibodies prior to tumor implantation, maintaining a depletion regimen throughout the experiment. These studies revealed elimination of CD8+ T cells abrogated all antitumor responses from HER2-LAMP vaccination (figure 4B-C), suggesting that HER2-LAMP vaccination efficacy is directly mediated by CD8+ T cells. Additionally, we found that depletion of CD4+ T cells eliminated the antitumor effect of the HER2-LAMP vaccine ( figure 4D-E) , suggesting that HER2-LAMP vaccination efficacy is also directly mediated by CD4+ T cells. To address if CD4+ T cells are critical to the induction of HER2-LAMP vaccine responses, we administered control or CD4 depleting antibodies prior to vaccination and TSA-HER2 tumor challenge ( figure 4F, online supplementary fig S4) . These studies revealed that tumor growth was only partially inhibited by the HER2-LAMP vaccine after CD4 depletion, indicating that CD4+ T cells play an important role in the induction phase of the immune response ( figure 4G ). As in non-tumor bearing mice, we again observed that HER2-LAMP vaccination significantly augmented the activation of CD8+ HER2-specific T-cells, which associated with S5D) . To address the role of CD4+ T cells in the effector phase of HER2-LAMP vaccine induced antitumor responses, we administered control or CD4 depleting antibodies postvaccination and TSA-HER2 tumor challenge ( figure 4F ). These studies again revealed that CD4 depletion at this phase had no significant effect on HER2-LAMP mediated antitumor responses. Taken together these results demonstrate that CD4+ T cells have essential function in the induction phase, but not the effector phase of HER2-LAMP vaccine driven antitumor immunity.",

Collectively, the systemic responses at these later time points (~9-30 weeks postvaccination) did not differ between the HER2-WT and HER2-LAMP cohorts, suggesting that differences in HER2-LAMP-elicited T cells may occur after the early induction of responses and their initial infiltration into these heterogeneous TMEs.",

Mice were implanted with tumors and vaccinated with control, HER2-WT or HER2-LAMP vectors (at day 3 and 10), before being sacrificed at day 17 to assess potential differences in infiltrating T cells (figure 6A). We found that while both vaccines significantly augmented CD8+ and CD4+ T cell infiltration, HER2-LAMP elicited significantly higher numbers of CD44+CD4+ T cells in comparison to HER2-WT vaccination ( figure 6B-C) . Moreover, tumors from HER2-LAMP-vaccinated mice expressed higher levels of T cell effector genes, such as Ifng and Gzmb, as well as the T cell trafficking chemokine Cxcl10, compared with HER2-WT controls ( figure 6D ). To determine if these inductions were due to enhanced CD4 +T cell 'help' during the induction phase, we assessed tumor infiltrates from mice that had been CD4 depleted prior to vaccination, along with respective controls (figure 4F-G). These assessments revealed that HER2-LAMP vaccination significantly augmented the abundance of total tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (figure 6E-F), as well as CD44/ CD8+ T cells in tumors compared with control mice ( figure 6G) . Notably, depleting CD4 +T cells during the induction phase decreased CD8 +T cell infiltration, as well as CD4+ T cells, in tumors of HER2-LAMP vaccinated mice (figure 6E-F). Additionally, we confirmed elevated expression of IFN\u03b3, Granzyme B, CXCL9 and CCL3 by qRT-PCR in these samples (online supplementary fig  S7A-D) . Consistent with these observations, vaccination with HER2-LAMP in a separate set of experiments using the orthotopic TSA-HER2 model (online supplementary  fig S7E) also elicited Ifng and Gzmb, as well Ccl3, Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 compared with HER2-WT controls (online supplementary fig S7F-J) .

However, despite a reduction in overall antigen expression, HER2-LAMP vaccines allowed for enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses to HER2 epitopes (encompassing both the ECD and the ICD domains) in comparison to control HER2 vectors in vivo. These enhanced responses were unaltered by different types of plasmid vaccination strategies (intramuscular or intradermal) and resulted in greater numbers of polyfunctional HER2-specific CD8+ effector T cells by HER2-LAMP vaccines in comparison to HER2-WT vaccines. Studies in infectious disease have demonstrated that vaccines capable of producing polyfunctional T cell responses are highly effective, which emerging immunooncology studies have likewise suggested may be critical for effective anti-tumor immunity. [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] To investigate how LAMP trafficking may generate these enhanced responses, we focused on potential differences in MHC class I and II presentation and resulting CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation.",

Using MHCII KO mice, we also found that HER2-LAMP vaccine presentation of HER2 epitopes through MHC class II was essential for induced HER2specific T cell responses, suggesting a critical role for MHCII presentation in HER2-LAMP vaccine-induced HER2-specific immunity. This effect was validated in T cell depletion experiments that revealed that CD4+ T cells played an important role in mediating HER2-LAMP antitumor immunity in the induction of immune responses from HER2-LAMP vaccination, but not in the antitumor effector phase ( figure 4) . Additionally, our studies also noted a direct enhancement of MHC class I presentation through enhanced stimulation and direct lysis of OTI/II-EGFP-LAMP expressing tumor cells by OTI CD8+ T cells in vitro, as well as enhanced expansion and activation of OTI T-cells after OVA-LAMP vaccination in comparison to OVA-WT vaccination in vivo. While the use of MHCI KO mice demonstrated suppressed HER2-specific T cell responses after HER2-LAMP vaccination, we found that CD8+ T cells were essential for HER2-LAMP anti-tumor immune responses. These data, along with our MHCII findings, suggest that HER2-LAMP enhances presentation and stimulates direct activation of CD8+ T cells, but also enhances MHCII presentation, in order to more effectively activate CD4+ T cells. In combination, the enhanced activation of class I and II pathways generate superior polyfunctional CD8+ T cell responses, which are able to more effectively infiltrate the TME (potentially through enhanced chemokine secretion) and elicit tumor-specific killing. Our depletion studies indicate CD8+ T cells are the dominant effector cells of",

            "text": "Perhaps most importantly, our studies also demonstrated that HER2-LAMP vaccination elicits long-term survival and complete tumor regression in ~30% of mice after both early and late vaccination in an aggressive and targeted therapy-resistant endogenous model of HER2+ BC. This result was striking, as our previous studies have demonstrated greater difficulty in immunotherapeutic strategies to elicit curative immunity in advanced cancers. 6 7 39 47 Notably, all vaccinated mice demonstrated significant systemic induction of HER2-specific T cell and B cell responses after vaccination that was similar between mice that remained tumor-free and those that had progressive HER2+ disease. This suggested that the differences in vaccine-induced antitumor immunity could be due to early differences in the induction of immunity that translated into differences in the TME. Using an orthotopic model that allowed us to examine tumors earlier postvaccination, we confirmed that HER2-LAMP vaccination induced more activated CD8+ and CD4+ T cell populations in the TME, as well as higher expression of IFN\u03b3, Granzyme B and various chemokines. These CD8+ T cell infiltrates in the TME were suppressed by depletion of CD4+ T cells during HER2-LAMP vaccination. This again suggests that HER2-LAMP-augmented antitumor immunity and increased survival may be due to a more potent activation of helper and subsequent activation of effector T cells that induce effector genes and recruitment chemokine profiles, which would be capable of causing tumor regression in a significant fraction of cancers. This response rate is similar to that seen in many cancers for PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade, where ~20% of mice respond to treatment. Notably, we have found that the use of PD-1 mAbs in this model has 100% mortality rate by 18 weeks (Crosby et al, Clinical Cancer Research (CCR) in review). This suggests that HER2-LAMP vaccination may offer a compelling approach to elicit anti-tumor immunity in aggressive cancers with low neoepitope burdens.",

This enhanced presentation results in greater activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, polyfunctional CD8+ T cells, and ultimately tumor rejection and long-term survival in a subset of mice. This mirrors preclinical and clinical studies with different immunotherapies in BC that demonstrate heterogeneous tumor regression associated with differences in T cell infiltration and local immunosuppression. 39 48 49 As our clinical studies suggest that the stimulation of HER2-specific memory CD8+ T cells is an important requirement for progression-free survival, 6 the use of HER2-LAMP vaccines may have a significant impact against treatment-resistant metastatic HER2+ BC. Given that effective local immunosuppression can still curtail these responses in a significant fraction of mice, HER2-LAMP vaccines may be effectively coupled with heterologous vaccines (such as our viral HER2 vectors) to further expand anti-HER2 immune responses, or with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors to counterbalance local immunosuppression, which are the focus of our continuing investigations. Additionally, the ability to elicit potent antitumor immunity against self-antigens suggests that this strategy may be highly effective in generating antitumor responses. Indeed, several studies have suggested that LAMP targeting allows for more effective HPV E6/E7-specific immune responses, as well as for enhanced antitumor immunity against HPV-related cancers. 11 29 30 50 51 More broadly, this study suggests that LAMP-based targeted therapies may be highly effective in the generation of novel cancer vaccines against overexpressed or mutated endogenous oncogenes in order to elicit robust, multipotent CD8+ T cell responses against established targeted-therapy resistant tumors.",

To test the impact of vaccines in early stage HER2+ BC, HER2\u039416 was induced by doxycycline administration and mice were vaccinated 1 week postinduction to simulate HER2 responses against developing HER2+ BC (figure 5A). Significantly, in this model both HER2-WT and HER2-LAMP vaccines overcame HER2 tolerance and induced HER2-specific systemic T cell and B cell responses (figure 5B-C), with a trend of T cell and B cell responses being greater in HER2-LAMP vaccinated mice. Strikingly, mice vaccinated with HER2-LAMP showed a significant survival advantage over mice vaccinated with HER2-WT (figure 5D). Notably, HER2-LAMP-vaccinated tumor-free mice displayed similar HER2-specific systemic T cell and B cell responses in comparison to tumor-bearing vaccinated mice (online supplementary fig",
