Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was then leveraged, using individual predictors or weighted combinations of predictors, to maximally distinguish between: 1) negative or positive diagnosis for COVID--19; and 2) mild or severe COVID--19 disease status. LDA relies on a regression--like linear set of functions that can combine several data (i.e., features) and create predictive models that are straightforward to interpret. It is recognized that having a small number of test cases, such as in the serology sub--cohort, with many data types and features can lead to overfitting 21 . To guard against non--robust estimations, parametric violations, and model overfitting, 1--fold cross--validation with non--parametric bootstrapping (95% Confidence Interval, 1000 iterations) was used.

Next, a series of forced entry models were used to see how well a set of related variables or features (e.g., demographics) predicted COVID--19 infection or disease severity. We recognize that some of these forced entry models are likely overfitted, particularly for modeling disease severity risk.

Baseline data from 10--14 years ago (Mean = 11.22 years) was available for demographic, laboratory, biochemistry, and clinical indices. A central theme of this report is the comparison of the 7,539 total test cases to a sub--group of 124 test cases with serology data ( Table 2) , in order to show that better model fit incorporating serology markers was not merely due to sample size differences or model inflation. Using non--parametric tests, then, Table 1 indicates that the full cohort and serology sub--groups largely did not differ on most measures.

For context, 70.6% of the 7,539 test cases were negative. Consequently, any predictor achieving an accuracy of 70.6% would be performing at chance. A better measure of accuracy in this case is the AUC, where 0.5 is at--chance prediction and 1.0 is perfect accuracy. We also focused on how well true COVID--19 positive cases were identified (i.e., specificity). Among all participants (Supplementary Table 1 ), any given significant predictor could not correctly distinguish any true positive test cases (0% Specificity; AUC mean and range=0.525, 0.515--0.548). For the serology sub--cohort (Supplementary Table  2 ), several established risk factors that loaded had better overall fit (mean AUC=0.625, AUC range=0.528--0.712), due to better specificity of predicting infection. Examples included ethnicity (13.2%), alcohol status (15.4%), apolipoprotein B (10.3%), and two unusually strong biochemistry analytes: urate (25.6%) and testosterone (56.4%). In order to see if biomarkers of past host response to pathogens was useful for predicting a current host response to COVID--19, we then tested each antibody titer for an antigen to a specific pathogen. As shown in Supplementary Table 3 , antibody titers to 14 antigens across 12 pathogens each performed as well on average as other types of predictors (mean AUC=0.627, AUC range=0.505--0.707).

While the biochemistry and serology forced entry models were likely overfitted, the analyses may nonetheless provide a \"best case scenario\" for their usefulness as a group. Notably, the stepwise model achieved 93.5% accuracy by correctly identifying when a COVID--19 test case was negative (94.1% sensitivity) or positive (92.3% specificity). Due to potential concerns with model overfitting, the stepwise model was re--run with only predictors that had individually loaded significantly (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) . This model had 6 variables and still achieved 79.8% accuracy. As shown in Supplementary Table 4, predictors that loaded in the stepwise model included antibody titers for antigens of several common pathogens (e.g., Human Cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia Trachomatis), lipid markers, age in years, white and red cell counts, and testosterone. Another set of analyses next determined how each baseline predictor could predict which of the 2,210 positive COVID--19 cases had a mild or severe disease course. For context, 45% and 55% of test cases were mild or severe respectively. Thus, accuracy of 50% would be considered chance prediction. Curiously, while specificity was the difficult metric to achieve for COVID--19 infection risk, accurately distinguishing true negatives (i.e., sensitivity) was problematic for disease severity. Among all 2,210 COVID--19 positive test cases (Supplementary Table 5 ), significant predictors showed a trade-off between better sensitivity or specificity and in general were only modestly useful (AUC mean and range=0.536, 0.524--0.572). Similarly, for the serology only sub--group among 39 COVID--19 positive test cases, Supplementary Table 6 shows that only alanine aminotransferase and neutrophil count significantly predicted disease severity beyond chance. Likewise, for serology data, Supplementary Table 7 indicates that the only significant antibodies to load were for the U14 antigen to human herpesvirus 7 (accuracy=64.1%; AUC=0.729) and JC VP1 antigen to human JC polyomavirus (accuracy=59%; AUC 0.671). Table 4 shows the relative predictive value of groups of predictors for COVID--19 severity. First, for the full sample of 2,210 positive test cases, accuracy remained low and the proportion of true negatives (i.e., sensitivity) identified did not exceed 37%. This was regardless of predictor sets with a sparse or dense number of predictors. Supplementary Table 8 illustrates that the stepwise model included only alanine aminotransferase, age in years, and monocyte count, which may explain its modest predictive utility above chance. For the serology sub--group of 39 test cases, despite strong concerns about model overfitting, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were similarly modest compared to all 2,210 positive test cases for the biochemistry, immunology, and serology panels. The stepwise model was sparse and had better overall accuracy (74.4%) due to improved detection of actual mild cases (61.5%). Indeed, Supplementary Table 8 shows that the stepwise model loaded 2 predictors, antibody titers for HTLV--1 gag antigen to the rare Human T Lymphotropic virus and JC VP1 antigen for the Human Polyomavirus that has an estimated prevalence of 57.5% in at least UK Biobank.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 605, "end": 635, "text": "(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1533, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF13"}, {"start": 1802, "end": 1809, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF16"}, {"start": 1971, "end": 1978, "text": "Table 7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2181, "end": 2188, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2537, "end": 2544, "text": "Table 8", "ref_id": "TABREF19"}, {"start": 3122, "end": 3129, "text": "Table 8", "ref_id": "TABREF19"}], "section": "As shown in"}, {"text": "The objective of this study was to determine if baseline data from 2006--2010 could predict which older adults would develop COVID--19 in 2020, and if that infection was presumptively mild or severe due to being at hospital.

For example, we found antigens to human cytomegalovirus were the strongest predictors of infection risk in our stepwise model. Older adults with prior human cytomegalovirus infection evince exhaustion of the na\u00efve T cell pool and fewer memory versus effector cells 22 . This may explain why monocyte count was one of the few variables to predict COVID--19 severity among all test cases in this study, as innate immunity must compensate. For COVID--19 severity prediction, antibody titer to the JC polyomavirus was the only serology predictor that loaded significantly in our stepwise model and is expressed in a majority of the general population. This virus can induce hemagglutination in type O blood cells 23 , which may in some way influence why this blood type may be protective for COVID--19 infection.

However, this marker merely reflects signaling of the acute phase response due to systemic infection, typically being initiated by macrophages in contact with the pathogen and monocytes in the blood.

The lack of association with bioimpedance--derived fat, muscle, and water quantitation, or long-standing illness, was unexpected but may be due to complex interactions that are beyond the scope of this report.
