Nucleotide Sanford, Golomb and Riddle (J. Biol. Chem., 258: 12804-12809, 1983 ) have identified a gene, ama-1 IV, which appears to code for a subunit of RNA polymerase 11. This gene was initially defined by the dominant mutation m118. positioned near &y=U on linkage group x. Strains carrying ama-l(mll8) are resistant to a-amanitin and produce an altered RNA polymerase 11 enzyme. To continue the analysis of RNA polymerase in C. elegans, we have: (1) isolated 7 lethal alleles of ama-1 including one temperature-sensitive allele and one gamma-ray-induced chromosomal rear&ment, (2) to date identified six essential genes near & (defined by 15 lethal mutations) one or more of which, by analogy with yeast (Ingles g. aJ, Proc.

The in vitro transcription experiments were performed with about 600 bp of flanking sequence from each gene, while the in vivo experiments were conducted with 365 bp of flanking sequence. The 61 promoter region was shown by S1 mapping to initiate RNA synthesis in vitro a t the same major sites as the authentic gene in the intact lens. Thus, the 5' flanking sequences of the 61 gene appear to have inherently stronger promoter activity than those of the 62 gene.

Complete transcription complexes and subassemblies were formed on these genes in vitro using transcription factor A and RNA polymerase I11 from Xenopus and factors B and C from HeLa. To demonstrate these complexes, the DNA and f a c t o m passed through a Sepharose 4B column. bound factors was assayed for transcription after addition of polymerase. factor A bound by itself and allowed factor C to bind, which in turn allowed factor B to bind. specific subassemblies formed imply that the order of addition to a 5s gene is factors A,C and B, and to the VA gene it is factors C and B. To study the stability of these assemblies we determined the effect of high ionic strength. Factors B and C were preincubated with the VA gene in the presence of high salt o r allowed to prebind under standard conditions and then raised to high salt. purification by Sepharose 4B chromatography. remain associated with the DNA even after 2.5 min washes with 0.8 M KC1.

Dalrymple and Werner Arber, Biozentrum, University of Basel, Klingelbergstrasse 70, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland Using plasmids carrying various fragments from IS30 (a resident mobile genetic element of E. coli K12) inserted in front of a promoterless galK gene several promoters of transcription have been identified. In a similar system insertion of fragments of IS30 between the -5 promoter and the galK gene has allowed us to identify sequences with terminator activity. The long open reading frame of IS30 is transcribed from a weak promoter (PA), the proposed -35 region of which is in the left hand terminal inverted repeat. Transcription from this promoter is not detectable immediately outside the right hand end. A second promoter (P,) is present in the right hand end of IS30, but transcription from this promoter is generally repressed. On the reverse strand a third promoter (P ) has been identified preceding a short open reading frame. A sequence whth weak termination activity follows this open reading frame. A much stronger terminator of transcription maps in the first two hundred bases of IS30 (but on the opposite strand to the large open reading frame). So far it is not clear whether this terminator is preceded by an additional active promoter.",

            "text": "RNA polymerase yields short PA, PR1 and PR2 RNAs. Comparison of supercoiled and linear templates indicates that supercoiling stimulates PA, inhibits PR2, and has little effect on PR1. With a supercoiled PA+ template, PA is substantially more active than either PR1 or PR2. With supercoiled templates carrying PA-down mutations, PA activity is reduced as expected, however PR1 activity, and to a lesser extent PR2 activity, are substantially increased. These results suggest that PA competes with both PR1 and PR2 for RNA polymerase. Development of the chicken lens is characterized by the sequential synthesis of three major classes of crystallins ( u , 6 and 6). Each crystallin mRNA displays a characteristic temporal and spatial pattern in the developing lens. 6-Crystallin is the first crystallin to appear and accumulates during lens induction whereas the 6-crystallin mRNAs accumulate rapidly near the end of the embryogenesis. The B-crystallins consist of several polypeptides. 635 (35K polypeptide) is particularly interesting because, unlike the other 5-crystallin polypeptides, it appears only in the lens fiber cells. We have isolated the gene for 835 and are characterizing its promoter region by functional analysis in vitro and in vivo. The 835 cDNA and most of the gene have been sequenced. Each exon encodes a structural motif of the protein. A 600 bp fragment flanking the 5' region of the gene shows characteristic features of eukaryotic promoters, including a high GC-rich structure. This putative crystallin promoter is recognized in vitro in a Hela cell extract. S1 nuclease mapping of the in vitro synthesized RNA shows several transcriptional initiation sites, clustered in a narrow region. Detailed characterizations of the fiber-cell specific promoter in vitro and in vivo and its comparison with other crystallin promoters are underway.",

The keratins are a family of 20 different polyeptides (MW40-70kd) that comprise 8nm cytoskeletal filaments in virtually all epithelial cells. These proteins can be divided into two distinct classes on the basis of t h e ability of their mRNAs to hybridize with one or the other of two different cloned keratin cDNAs. Different pairs of type I and type I1 keratin mRNAs are coordinately expressed in different epithelia and a t different stages of differentiation and development, indicating the importance of both types of subunits in filament assembly. cDNA sequence analyses have revealed that different pairs of keratins have unique sequences in localized domains and these differences influence the properties of the resulting filaments. Through c D N A sequencing, we have learned that the two types of keratins share only about 25% homology. We have now shown that despite this divergence in sequence, the predicted structures of these proteins and also the structures of their genes are remarkably similar. We are now investigating the regulatory regions of these genes to begin to elucidate t h e basis for their differential expression. In this context, we are particularly interested in determining whether vitamin A plays any direct role in regulating the expression of the keratin genes. We have already demonstrated that the vitamin specifically influences the levels of certain keratin mRNAs. It has been proposed that the vitamin and its cellular receptor act in a fashion similar to that of steroid hormones. The basic nature of the sequence features that define a promoter sequence for E. coli RNA polymerase have been established by a variety of biochemical and genetic methods. developed rigorous,analytical methods for finding unknown patterns that occur imperfectly in a set of several sequences, and have used them to examine bacterial promoters. The algorithm easily discovers the \"consensus\" sequences for the -10 and -35 regions, which are identical to the results of previous analyses (Hawley and McClure, 1983) , but requireno prior assumptions about the patterns. \"consensus\" sequences we give a rigorous definition to this concept that is widely applicable. We also provide estimates for the statistical significance of cornon patterns discovered.",

One important condition to garantee high levels of expression of a cloned gene is to locate it under the control of efficient promoter sequences. It has been recently shown that in E.coli the maintenance of strong promoters on plasmid vectors is dependent on the presence, on the same plasmid, of efficient terminator regions downstream from the promoter. This condition seems to prevent the transcription process from interfering with the plasmid replication and consequently allows the maintenance of the plasmid in the cells. In order to investigate on the influence of different promoters and terminators on the F-lactamase expression in both 5 and B.subtilis we have constructed a shuttle vector in which the pBR322-coded ?.-lactamase is inserted in such a way to present an EcoRI site immediately preceeding the ATG of the gene and a Hind111 site immediately following its stop codon. In this way we have been able to easily modify both the promoter and the terminator strenght and to follow the effects of these modifications on the expression of the gene. A comparison of the behavior of E.coli and B.subtilis under these different conditions is reported.

Inverted repeat sequences are cleaved in the non-base-paired loops of potential hairpin structures. At 27OC, sites map at a promoter activated by cyclic-AMP receptor protein and near the presumed end of the Tet-R gene transcript. Examination of the known sequences around the 27OC sites shows average dA+dT-content and no strong hairpin potential. Our results demonstrate that DNA unwinding detectable by mung bean nuclease occurs at promoter and terminator regions in preference to protein-coding regions in supercoiled pBR322 DNA. might affect promoter function is by altering local DNA secondary structure. Trypanosoma brucei displays a discontinuity in RNA synthesis,in which 35 nt from the 5' end of an RNA molecule of about 140 nt (mini-exon-derived precursor RNA or medRNA) end up at the 5' end of all mRNAs analyzed to date. Whether this discontinuous transcription results from reinitiation of transcription using the medRNA as a primer or from bimolecular splicing is unknown. Recent studies with isolated nuclei indicate that mini-exon genes,VSG genes and other protein-coding genes each differ inof-amanitin sensitivity of transcription,which suggests that different polymerases are responsible for their transcription. We have investigated whether mature mRNAs in T.brucei contain a 5' cap and if so,whether the cap is TJready present on the medRN9. chemical decapping and enzymatic recapping witha-P-GTP of total and poly(A) RNA followed by either dot blot hybridization or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,electroblotting and mini-exon hybridization showed that both mature mRNAs and medRNA are 5' capped. We conclude that the medRNA donates its 5' cap to the mRNA molecule. These experiments also confirmed the existence of a second minor medRNA of-125 nt and revealed other prominent small capped W A S which do not hybridize to the mini-exon.

Mouse LMTK-cells were permanently transformed with the modified genes by TK-linked transformation and correctly initiated D-globin transcripts from induced and uninduced cells were determined by quantitative 51 mapping.

We have isolated a rat MT-I gene and two pseudogenes and have characterized the pattern of DNase I hypersensitive sites prior to and after induction.

Pseudogene 21 contains homologous sequences only as far 5' as the cap site, but pseudogene 27 contains hanologous sequences 1 3 3 b.p. further 5'-This pseudogene contains all sequences required for metal regulated expression of the MT gene and probably arose from a transcript initiated at an upstream promoter. DNase I hypersensitivity studies show a single hypersensitive site upstream fran the MT-I gene. Pseudogene 21, which lacks all sequences required for expression, lacks this hypersensitivity.Pseudogene 27, which contains sequences required for regulated expression, also does not have a hypersensitive site, leading us to predict that this gene is not expressed. This prediction is substantiated by our failure to detect transcripts corresponding to this pseudogene by a variety of experimental approaches. These sequences which are required for expression of the MT-I gene, are therefore not sufficient to direct transcription of this MT-I pseudogene.

Nuclear \"run-off\" assay indicated that only part of this increase (2-5 fold) was due to regulation at the transcriptional level. Therefore, both transcription of the gene and stability of mRNA are affected by the presence of steroid hormones. In addition, prolonged administration of progesterone and estrogen resulted in a reduced level of mRNA sequences in the oviduct tissue while ovalbumin mRNA sequence continued to increase. Therefore, the PRB gene was apparently self regulated. When the other tissues were examined, we were surprised to detect the mRNA sequence for PRB antigen, although some of these tissues have not been reported to bind progesterone. This suggests that progesterone target tissues may require a redefinition to those which can produce the hormone binding isoform. The promoter elements necessary for the initiation of transcription of the ovalbumin gene have been localized previously by transfer of an ovalglobin fusion gene into HeLa S3 cells. A region containing the \"TATA\" box, a highly conserved sequence located around 25 to 30 base pairs upstream from the cap site of most mRNA-encoding genes, is required for initiation of transcription.

Alternating purine-pyrimidine DNA sequences can undergo B to Z transitions when stabilized by negative supercoiling in physiological conditions. Studies with anti-2 antibody in biological systems strongly suggest a role in gene expression or DNA packaging, but there has been no direct evidence for this in vivo. The mouse metallothionein-I promoter has a potential Z-DNA sequence 86-102 base pairs from the transcription start site within the 216 bp Sst I-Bgl I1 region of the promoter thought to be involved directly with heavy metal induction. This sequence 5'-GCGCGGGTGETATGCGTG-3' is an alternating purine/pyrimidine sequence except for the central two base pair interruption. The Sst I-Bgl I1 fragment was cloned into pUC 12 and shown not to flip into Z conformation by two-dimensional chloroquine gel electrophoresis. To facilitate the B to Z transition and study its effect on transcription, we cloned this fragment into ml3-mpl0 and inverted the central AC to CA by oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis. This creates a 17 base alternating purinejpyrimidine sequence within the potential Z-DNA region. The wild type and mutant sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. A 216 bp region containing the mutation was re-cloned into pUC 12. Two-dimensional chloroquine gel electrophoresis of the mutant metallothionein promoter demonstrated a structural transition which may involve Z-DNA. The effect this mutation has on transcription of linked genes with respect to heavy metal induction is currently being assayed by transfection and Northern Analysis.

We have employed polysome immunoadsorption using glucocorticoid receptor-specific antibodies to obtain eight overlapping cDNA clones which together appear to contain the entire coding sequence of the rat glucocorticoid receptor gene. One of these clones containing a cDNA insert of 2 . 6 kb was used for a preliminary analysis of glucocorticoia receptor gene organization and expression. receptor seems to be encoded by a single copy gene which is indistinguishable in DNA isolated from rat liver or fibroblast cell lines. Wild type rat and mouse cells accumulate a 5.8 kb receptor transcript; receptor deficient (r-) mutants, which display reduced steroid binding activ.ity, accumulate reduced amounts of the 5.8 kb transcript. transfer (ntl) mutants, which produce a receptor of 40 kd rather than the 94 kd protein observed in wild type cells, contain a receptor transcript of only 4 . 8 kb. experiments of receptor coding sequences into receptor mutant cell lines are being performed to assess directly the functional potential of these clones. By fractionating various types of transcription extracts and examining different genes, we have recently identified several promoter-specific transcription factors that impart selectivity to RNA polymerases I and 11. The first of these auxiliary transcription factors identified was Spl, which binds specifically to the \"GC-boxes\" that are contained within the control sequences located upstream of the SV40 early promoter. More recently, this cellular transcription factor has been shown to bind and activate not only SV40 transcription, but also several other promoters, including the immediate-early promoter of the HSV ICP4 gene as well as cellular promoters such as the mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene and the promoter for a cellular monkey gene. In each of these cases, spl was found to bind multiple GC-box containing sequences located upstream from the start site of transcription and that activation of RNA synthesis required the presence of Spl. In addition to studying the interaction of specific transcription factors with viral and cellular genes, we have also begun to investigate the transcription of developmentally regulated and tissue-specific genes in Drosophila. Transcription of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene is under the control of two tandem promoters (proximal and distal) that are activated in a temporally-regulated fashion during Drosophila development. We have fractionated a Drosophila tissue culture extract system and identified a specific transcription factor, Adf-1, that binds to the upstream region of the distal Adh promoter and activates transcription. Footprint analysis also revealed the presence of additional sequence-specific binding proteins present in the extract that recognize and interact with the upstream regions of the proximal promoter of Adh.",

Previous results from this laboratory have shown that duanomycin will bind preferentially to alternating purine-pyrimidine DNA sequences. Since these are the sequences able to undergo the transition from B form DNA to the left handed 2 form, the effect of daunomycin on the B to 2 transition has been examined. Daunomycin inhibits the rate B to 2 transition. Binding of the drug to poly d(G-C) under solution conditions that favor the Z form is cooperative, a finding consistent with a model in which the drug preferentially binds to the B form, and allosterically converts 2 DNA to an intercalated B form. The allosteric conversion of 2 DNA back to the B form has been directly demonstrated by circular dichroism, sedimentation, and enzymatic methods. The conversion of 2 DNA to the B form is strongly dependent on ionic strength, and under some conditions as little as one drug molecule for every 25 b.p. is sufficient to completely convert the polymer to the B form. This is a striking demonstration of how a small molecule may exert long-range allosteric effects on DNA conformation.

The proinsulin mRNA transcripts from the tumor cell line and fetal pancreatic tissue were estimated to be respectively 100 bases and 50 bases larger than the adult pancreatic transcript. I t has been shown that glucose is an important regulator of proinsulin mRNA fi 9. There is known to be a marked increase in the concentration of proinsulin mRNA and insulin in the developing rat neonate although plasma glucose levels are quite low. Expression of proinsulin mRNA independent of glucose levels is also found in insulinoma tissue. In addition, there is a second TATA sequence upstream of the putative start site in rat insulin gene 11. These observations, including the fact that the transcription initiation site(s) has never been mapped in these tissues, suggested that alternative promoter sites may be important in control of initiation of gene transcription. To map the 5' end of the gene, primer extension was performed using a synthetic oligonucleotide primer complementary to the first twenty bases of the coding portion of the two rat insulin genes. The extended products of the proinsulin mRNAs from the three tissues were identical indicating that at least 95% of proinsulin mRNA transcription occurs at the putative start site. The 3' ends of the proinsulin mRNA transcripts were evaluated by ribonuclease H digestion and i t was shown that the noted size differences could be accounted for by different length poly A tails.

Translation of a leader peptide coding region containing tandem Trp codons governs formation of the alternative secondary structures. Ribosome stalling on the Trp codons promotes formation of a secondary structure that allows transcription of the operon, while ribosome movement to the stop codon causes transcription termination. For attenuation to be efficient, translation of the leader peptide coding region must be coupled to transcription of the leader region. A transcription pause site in the leader region may accomplish this synchronization by halting transcription until the translating ribosome releases the paused RNA polymerase. We have demonstrated that the translating ribosome does indeed release the transcription pause in the a leader region during coupled transcription/translation. Plasmid DNA templates with wild type and mutant sequences incapable of directing leader peptide synthesis were analyzed for the quantity of steady state pause RNA during coupled transcription/translation reactions. The mutant templates produced levels of pause RNA 10-fold greater than wild type. All templates gave nearly identical pausing kinetics in a purified transcription system lacking translational machinery. Release of the paused transcription complex by translation of the leader peptide coding region was confirmed by adding the translation inhibitor kasugamycin to coupled reactions with the wild type template. The treatment of cultured cells with interferons results in the synthesis of a number Of unique polypeptides. We have recently characterized two cDNA's (pIF-IND1 and 2) which hybridize to two W A ' s whose transcription is activated when human diploid fibroblasts or HeLa cells are treated with type 1 interferons (Larner et al. PNAS, in press). In fibroblasts, enhanced transcriptional activity of the genes corresponding to IF-IND1 and 2 occurs with less than 30 min of interferon (IFN) treatment, and the transcriptional activation of these genes declines to basal levels after 8 hrs of IFN treatment. Treatment of fibroblasts with cycloheximide prior to the addition of IFN-a both increases the rate and the period during which these genes are transcribed compared to cells incubated with only IFN-a. The action of cycloheximide is specific, since it has no effect on the transcription rates of other genes not induced by IFN such as 8-tubulin, arginine tRNA, or 28s ribosomal RNA. HeLa cells treated with IFN-a demonstrate a similar time course for the initial transcriptional activation of IFNl and 2. However, these genes are actively transcribed for 24 hrs in the continuous presence of interferon. In addition, treatment of HeLa cells with cycloheximide prior to the addition of IFN is without effect on the rate of IFN-a-induced transcription of these genes. These results suggest that a factor(s) is present in fibroblasts, but not in HeLa cells that Selectively Prevents the transcription of the IFN-induced genes. Protein synthesis appears to be required for this factor(s) to exert its action in human fibroblasts. ",

(iii) This binding, i n t u r n , a c t i v a t e s the RNAdependent ATPase of rho, which leads t o termination. rRNA transcription is down regulated in response to starvation in Acanthamoeba. This regulation can be reproduced in a faithful in vitro transcription initiation system: SlOO extracts from vegetative cells actively transcribe rRNA while extracts from starved cells cannot unless they are supplemented with RNAP I purified from vegetative cells. The levels of both the transcription initiation factor(s) [TIF I] and the levels of RNAP I assayed on nonspecific templates (i.e. calf thymus DNA) are constant, but the RNAP I from the starved cell cannot specifically initiate transcription. This property is retained in RNAP I purified to near homogeneity from the starved cell even though its specific activity on calf thymus DNA matches that of the vegetative polymerase. RNAP I from starved cells has the same subunit composition as that from vegetative, but is 5X more heat labile than vegetative enzyme when assayed on nonspecific template. The small amount of enzyme active in the specific initiation assay has heat denaturation properties of vegetative polymerase. BAL-31 deletion mapping has shown that the sequence from -47 to +8 is necessary and sufficient to promote rRNA transcriptionno far upstream sequence requirement can be detected in vitro. This sequence region has been shown to contain two domains involved in TIF-I binding plus a third required motif, and to be sufficient to demonstrate regulation in vitro. Therefore, the steps in transcription involving this DNA sequence and RNAP I are impaired by the modification of the enzyme from starved cells. Supported by NIH GM26059 and GM22580. ",

            "text": "W e have constructed a plasmid cloning and expression system for E. coli in which direct attachment of a gene to sequences regulating transcription and t F a n m i o n can be achieved rapidly and efficiently. The system includes the following main features: 1) A multi-copy cloning plasmid contains a bank of 10 unique restriction sites which are flanked by transcriptional terminators. A gene (clockwise 5' to 3 ' ) can be inserted at one of the restriction sites. It is protected by the 5' terminator from unregulated transcription which prevents its establishment. The gene can be conveniently modified in the cloning vector to contain a restriction site at the desired 5' end. Although it is well documented that actively transcribed genes are contained within a more open, DNase I sensitive chromatin conformation, little i s known of how this structure is established. One model suggests that the DNA sequence at the transition from the inactive to active chromatin, through the binding of a sequence specific protein, causes the disruption of the highly compact closed chromatin structure. By defining the DNase I sensitive domain around the ovomucoid gene we hope to identify such a sequence by comparison to the previously defined ovalbumin chromatin domain. From a cosmid library we constructed a clone containing the ovomucoid gene and 16 kb of 5' and 18 kb of 3' flanking DNA has been isolated. The DNase I sensitivity of DNA fragments around the ovomucoid gene has been determined via a novel probe-excess solution hybridization assay using SP6 RNA polymerase synthesized RNAs as probes. The DNase I sensitive region extends approximately 15 kb beyond the 5' end of the ovomucoid gene and about 10 kb from the 3' end of the gene. Further analysis should precisely define the boundaries of this domain. As was the case with the ovalbumin DNase I sensitive domain, members of the CRI family of middle repititive sequences are found near the transition from an open to a closed structure. This is in agreement with the proposal that these CRI sequences may act through the binding of a sequence specific protein these open chromatin structures during diEferentiation of the chicken oviduct cell. A fusion gene consisting of the promoter region from the mouse metallothionein-I (IQ-I) gene joined to the coding region of the HSV thymidine kinase (TK) gene i s efficiently regulated by. zinc when transfected into baby hamster kidney cells in a transient assay. Analysis of similar plasmids containing 5' deletions, internal deletions and linker scanning mutants of the MT-I promoter region confirmed the function of the previously recognized metal regulatory sl?ment-a (MRE-a), sequence CCTTTGCGCCCG, between -55 and -44 bp from the cap site, and further localized upstream sequences with regulatory function to short regions of DNA containing sequences related but not identical to MRE-a. In total we recognize five MRE's within 180 bp of the hT-I cap site. taken the annroach of trying to build a metal-responsive promoter by inserting a 17-bp synthetic DNA fragment containing the MRE-a sequence into the non-responsive promoter of the TK gene. No induction by zinc was observed with single insertions of the regulatory sequence, whereas many different construccioci with two copies of MRE-a were inducible. The precise position of t h two MKB's relative to ex?, other or to other promoter elements had relatively little effect upon t5e efficiency of induction, but the inducibility could be further increased by introduction of a third and fourth HRE-a seauence. The MRE's act cooperatively with the TK distal promoter elements, but in the presecce of the TATA-box alone they function as zinc-dependent positive promoter elements. Transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of a mouse metallothionein I/human growth hormone fusion gene into fertilized mouse eggs followed by implantation of the embryos into pseudopregnant foster mothers. Five of twenty-six mice born after one series of injections contsined from 1 to 8 copies of the fusion gene stably integrated into their genomes and expressed human growth hormone in their serum. transgenic offspring were treated with glucocorticoids, serum growth hormone levels were induced from 1.5to 6.3-fold. of the five mice was also observed after treatment with glucocorticoids. DNA sequences responsible for the observed inductions must be present in the human growth hormone portion of the fusion gene since other fusion genes containing the mouse metallothionein I promoter were not glucocorticoid inducible in previous gene transfer experiments.",

Hinter.Laboratory of Molecular Riology, Medical Research Concil Centre, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH. ENGLAND The several E.coli amino-acyl tRNA synthetases studied appear to have different patterns of regulation. For example, alanyl-tRNA synthetase and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase appear to be autoregulated (Putney and Schimmel,l981; Springer et al, 1983) . but glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase is not (Cheung and Soll, 1984) . We have characterized the 5' non-coding region of the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase gene (tyrS) of Bacillus Stearothermophilus and have experimentally identified a promoter and terminator. Presumably, the terminator is involved i n regulation of tyrosy-tRNA synthetase levels, but our data indicates that it is not regulated directly by the enzyme. Furthermore, the terminator differs from those found i n amino acid biosynthetic operons in that there is no peptide rich in tyrosine i n the putative attenuator region. References:-Putney and Schimmel ( Genes coding for H4 histones expressed in sea urchin embryos at different stages are highly diverged and organized in a very different way. The early H4 gene is part of the tandemly reiterated 5 histone gene unit whereas the late H4 gene occurs mostly in H3-H4 pairs present in far fewer copies per genome (40 VS. several hundred early H4 genes). We have demonstrated that nuclei isolated from the sea urchin, S, puruuratus, transcribe H4 histone sequences which are specific to early and late embryonic stages, as in vivo.",

In this system, the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) area of a given sequence was replaced by several other sequences. We have found that an increase in the length of complementarity with the 3'-end of the 165 rRNA (i.e., the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence) results in a decrease in translational efficiency. Using the same system, we also found that the sequence in the spacer region; i.e., the region between the SD-sequence and the start codon, affects the mRNA translatability; A's and T's favor the expression, C's lower the expression, and G's essentially abolish translatability. (Note that G residues are almost never found in natural messengers in the spacer region.) the anti-SD sequence (as found on the 16s rRNA) and the anti-SD-sequence on the 165 rRNA with the SD-sequence. The messenger in which the sequence 5' GGAGG as the SD-region was replaced by 5' CCUCC was completely inactive. We mutated (by site-directed M13-mutagenesis procedures) the anti-SD-region in a 16s rRNA gene of the plasmid pKK3535 from 5' CCUCC (its natural sequence) to 5' GGAGG. Upon reconstruction of the plasmid, transformants were obtained that contained large deletions in the plasmid borne 16s rRNA gene, showing that such a mutation is lethal. (Similar observations were made by A. Dahlberg's group at Brown University, personal comunication.) Currently, we are replacing the authentic ribosomal RNA promoters of pKK3535 by an inducible promoter in an attempt to prevent lethality.",

Rut if the firstAUG triplet occurs in a suboptimal context, only some 405 subunits stop and initiate there; some bypass that site and initiate at another AUG codon that lies farther downstream. This ':modified scanning model\" makes several predictions which I have evaluatedbyintroducing mutations around, and upstream from, the AUG initiator codon in a cloned preproinsulin gene.

            "text": "A number of parameters have been studied using this system: (a) Single nucleotide changes in position -3 (i.e., 3 nucleotides upstreamfromthe AUG codon) or position +4 were found to modulate the yield of proinsulin over a 15-fold range. The optimal nucleotides are A in position -3 and G in position +4; the contributions of those two positions are not simply additive. Single nucleotide changes in positions-1, -2, -4 or -5 have much smaller effects on translational efficiency. (b) An oligonucleotide has been inserted upstream from the AUG initiator codon that is complementary to a block of 13 nucleotides, includingthe AUG codon. The formation of a stable hairpin structure in which the AUG triplet is completely base paired does not preclude translation, implying that ribosomes can melt secondary structure barriers in mRNA. (c) The ability of eukaryotic ribosomes to reinitiate translation following a terminator codon4 has been confirmed. Theefficiency of reinitiation has been shown to depend on the position of the terminator codon relative to the second (downstream) initiator codon. (d) The possibility that triplets other than AUG can serve as initiator codons in higher eukaryotes was tested by introducing point mutations that changed the AUG codon to AUA,AUU, GUG or UUG. The nonstandard initiator codons that work, at least to some extent, in prokaryotes do not function to a detectable extent in higher eukaryotes. A systematic analysis of mutational alterations within the transcribed region of the CYCl gene has revealed certain essential features of the translational process in yeast. Altered DNA sequences were obtained by a variety of techniques, including the selection of mutations, revertants and recombinant i n vivo and the alteration of cloned DNA segments i n v i t r o . The following alterations have been extensively characterized: point mutations of the AUG initiator codon; small deletions and insertion in the 5' untranslated region; bp substitutions adjacent to the AUG initiator codon; relocation of the AUG initiator codon; and formation of sequences with two AUG codons. The levels of the CYCl mRNA and of the gene product, iso-1-cytochrome c , were determined in strains containing single copies of the altered CYCl genes at the normal chromosomal position. codon is required for effective initiation of translation; however, certain other codons can be used at below 1% of the normal efficiency, and these levels can be enhanced by suppressors unlinked to the CYCl locus. (ii) Deletions and AUG relocation indicate there is no requirement for specific sequences o r a ribosome binding site adjacent to the AUG initiator codon. (iii) Insertions and deletions indicate that the distance between the CAP sites and the AUG initiator codon can be varied without appreciably affecting the efficiency of translation. (iv) Hairpin and possibly other secondary structures in the mRNA can greatly diminish translation; the degree of inhibition is dependent on the strength of the hairpin structure and on the position of the AUG codon relative to the hairpin structure. (v) The translational efficiency is influenced by nucleotides at position -1 and -3; however, this context effect varies with the position of the AUG initiator codon along the mRNA. (vi) Protein synthesis initiates at the 5 ' proximal AUG codon in most sequences. Insertion of an upstream AUG codon can prevent OK diminish initiation from the normal downstream start site, and the efficiency is a function of the sequence context. This result implies that protein synthesis can initiate concomitantly at more than one AUG codon with special contexts.

An apparently autoregulatory pathway determines the level of new tubulin synthesis in virtually all animal cells. Increase in the intracellular pool of free tubulin subunits results in dramatically lowered levels of tubulin mRNAs. To understand the molecular basis for this regulation, we have transiently introduced a cloned tubulin gene into cultured niouse fibroblasts and demonstrated that the heterologous gene is transcribed and correctly processed into stable mRNA. 1,loreover. using colchicine to induce depolymerization of endogenous microtubules and a corresponding elevation of the pool o f free tubulin subunits, we have shown that the expression of the heterologous tubulin gene is suppressed concomitantly with that of the endogenous mouse tubulin genes, nowever, such downregulation is not observed following transfection of a hybrid actin gene which is transcribed under the control of a tubulin proniotor. This observation, together with our previous findings that tubulin gene transcription in nuclei from control and colchicinetreated cells is not subject to down-regulation. strongly suggests that the autoregulation of tubulin synthesis i s not modulated on a transcriptional level. Results with other recombinant gene constructs are consistent with this hypothesis and serve to define more closely the genetic region(s) which contains the regulatory signal.

Several protein factors have been identified as being necessary for the binding of mRNA to 40s ribosomal subunits. However, very little is known about how these proteins act during messenger binding and how their activities might be regulated. One Of the initiation factors required for mRNA binding is eIF4A, a single polypeptide of 43kd. Interestingly, it is required as a single polypeptide for mRNA binding, and is present, along with several other proteins, in a high molecular weight complex involved in cap recognition. It also has the ability to discriminate between different mRNAs, that is, it stimulates the translation of different messengers to different extents. In order to better understand the function and possible regulation of eIF4A. we have isolated mouse cDNA clones coding for this factor. We describe the isolation and characterization (including the nucleotide sequence) of these clones. We have used these clones to examine the expression of mRNA coding for eIF4A and present evidence suggesting the existence of two different messengers coding for eIF4A. ",

The sequence requirement at the circularization site has been studied by two different approaches. Addition of certain short oligonucleotides, containing free 3' hydroxyl groups, vill reopen the circular form of the IVS, yielding a linear IVS with the oligonucleotide covalently attached to its 5' end. The product of this reaction will recircularize with release of the added oligonucleotide, indicating two nucleotides 5' to the site of circularization are sufficient for circularization. By varying the sequence of the added oligonucleotides in the reaction, it was found that certain combinations of pyrimidine dimers and trimers work best for reopening the IVS. Relative reactivity of oligonucleotides is sequence dependent: CU works better than W, which works approximately as well as CC; UUU works better than UU. These data support the existence of an oligopyrimidine binding site within the IVS.",

RNA was transcribed in vltro from a plasmid containing a single BBlnl linker (CGGATCCG) inserted in the IVS at the primary circularization site. The IVS was found to excise and to circularize to the UCC sequence within the linker. Deletions at this site, generated by S1 nuclease treatment of BasHI-cut plasaid, shifted the preferred sites of circularization either to the secondary site or to cryptic sites. The presence of three BamHIlinkers at this site displaced the major site of circularization out of the linker sequences to the secondary site, presumably because the repeated linker sequences form a sterloop structure. The major site of circularization in each of s i x constructs was immediately preceeded by three pyrimidines, suggesting the existence of a binding site for a tripyrimidine sequence, but position and MA secondary structure also appear to be important in the selection of circularization sites. The RNase P of Bacillus subtilis consists of protein (17K mol. wt.) and RNA (395 nucleotides) elements, both required for cleavage of 5' precursor segments from tRNAs under \"physiological\" conditions. P RNA alone carries out the reaction with perfect fidelity. The high cation concentrations probably in part provide counterion shielding to overcome anionic repulsion between the two interacting polynucleotides, the RNase P RNA and the precursor tRNA. However, the character of the ion dependence, inhibition of the reaction by high SO4-2 concentration and potentiation of the reaction by solvents (ethanol, DMSO) suggest that RNA conformational transition is involved in the reaction. It may be that the reason for catalysis by RNA rather than protein in the RNase P reaction is a requirement for fluidity in the structure of the catalyst, so that it can accomodate many tRNA substrates, which vary in their structural details.",

This best will drive from phylogenetic comparisons, seeking common foldings among homologous RNase P RNAs with different sequences. The sequences of the RNase P RNAs of B. subtilis (395 NT) and E. coli (377 NT) are known.

It also requires the direct participation of three cellular proteins NusA, NusB and S10 in roughly stoichiometric amounts. S10 is a normal component of the ribosome. In addition to S10, ribosomes contain active N, NusA and NusB proteins. It seems likely that N-action in the cell involves the ribosome. However, N-action need not involve the translational coupling phenomenon since translation upstream, across and downstream of the nut locus does not play a necessary role in antitermination.

We are currently using partially purified componen? : : of the silkworm transcription apparCirus to learn which cornponent(s) interact differentially with the two kinds of genes. Most gene transcribed by RNA polymerase I1 contain the hexanucleotide, 5'-AAUAAA-3', just upstream from the polyadenylation site. We have examined the signal requirements for processing and polyadenylation by using derivatives of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HSV-tk). Three lines of evidence suggest that the hexanucleotide alone is sufficient to signal processing and polyadenylation: (i) The HSV-tk gene was resected from its 3' end. All derivatives which retained the AAUAAA were able to produce poly A+ tk mRNA in transfected Cos-1 cells. The HSV-tk gene contains two copies of the AAUAAA. Resection with Bal 31 nuclease was used to generate deletion derivatives of the tk gene. Derivatives retaining at least 50 bp of information distal to these AAUAAAs produced near wildtype levels of tk mRNA. Retention of fewer than 40 nucleotides distal t o the AAUAAAs resulted in a reduced level of poly A+ tk mRNA. (ii) Poly A+ tk mRNA was produced when the HSV-tk polyadenylation signal was replaced with an 88 bp fragment of SV40 DNA, containing an AAUAAA that is never used as a polyadenylation signal during SV40 infection. (iii) Random fragments of either simian (4.0-15 kb) or prokaryotic (0.2-1.5 kb) DNA were inserted into an HSV-tk derivative lacking a polyadenylation signal. Poly A+ tk mRNA production was restored by 83% of the simian and 92% of the prokaryotic DNA fragments. Together, these results suggest that the minimum signal necessary for processing/polyadenylation is a hexanucleotide (AAUAAA o r similar) and that additional sequences in the vicinity of the AAUAAA affect the efficiency of the reaction, probably by affecting the secondary structure of the precursor RNA.

Introduction of the plasmid into Drosophila cells in culture results in the expression of functional CAT enzyme. At some levels of transfected DNA, CAT expression is inducible by exposure of the transfected cells to a brief heat shock. When larger amounts of plasmid DNA are transfected, CAT activity is expressed at a very high level and heat shock control of CAT expression is lost. This DNA induction of CAT activity is, in fact, brought about by plasmid DNA. The DNA induction is demonstrated by cotransfection of a small amount of the hsp 70-CAT plasmid with a large amount of plasmid pBR322. A similar plasmid in which a CAT gene was placed under the control of a Drosophila 88F actin promoter was constructed.

An early event in heat shock in Drosophila and other organisms is the dephosphorylation of the ribosomal protein, 56. To determine whether this change plays a role in translational regulation in heat shock we have set up an RNA-dependent in vitro translation system from normal and heat shocked Drosophila Kc cells which mimics the regulation of translation seen in intact cells in these conditions. We have fractionated the lysates into washed ribosanal and supernatant fractions and used the fractions to determine whether ribosome or supernatant factors control the changes in translation regulation in heat shock.",

Center, Jackson, MS 3 9 2 1 6 -4 5 0 5 . When Friend erythroleukemia cells are incubated at 4 3 degrees there is a rapid and nearly complete inhibition of protein synthesis which can be reversed when cells are returned to their normal growing temperature of 37 degrees. Examination of the recovery of FEC from heat shock indicates that most cellular mRNAs behave as a cohort and return to translation at approximately the same rate. We found a noteable exception to this rule in the case of a 78 kD basic protein (named protein A) whose rate of return to a normal synthetic rate is markedly inhibited subsequent to heat shock. For example, the synthesis of protein A is inhibited by greater than 6 0 percent compared with a host of other cell proteins when cells heat shocked for 3 0 minutes at 4 3 degrees are allowed to incorporate [ 3 5 S ] methionine for one hour at 37 degrees. Longer periods of heat shock increases the disparity between the rate of protein A synthesis and other cell proteins. We found that the inhibition of protein A synthesis is not due to an increase in protein turnover after heat shock nor to a disappearance of protein A mRNA. We show that protein A corresponds to the 78 kD polypeptide commonly found to be associated with the poly(A) tails of mammalian mRNA (PABP). Further analysis of heat-shocked FEC indicates that the composition of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles changes after stress so that PABP comprises a significantly smaller percentage of mRNP polypeptides. able gene and have found that approximately one in 10,000 integration events leads to the expression of the provirus from the viral promoter (1).

Several classes~of mitochondria1 ene transcripts were observed: 1)thuse present in the procyclic stage only $COX 11) 2) those more abundant in the procyclic stage (apocytochrorne b, COX I), 3 ) those more abundant in the bloodstream stage (mammalian URF1+/5, other transcripts), and 4) those with similar abundance in both stages (mammalian URFl and several small transcripts).Class 1 and 2 transcripts all correspond to the respiratory proteins. Many but not all transcripts exist as pairs, and differential expression is usually evident in anly one transcript of the pairs. Large transcripts, presumably precursors f o r contiguous genes, are observed for some but not all transcribed regions.

On limitation of the oxygen concentration, the level of bacteriorhodopsin in the cell increases up to five-fold (Sumper, M. 6 Herrmann, G., FEBS Lett -69:149-152, 1976). A second putative gene affecting the synthesis of bacteriorhodopsin has been identified as the site of insertions resulting in a Bop phenotype. This gene (designated &) is located 526 bp upstream of the &gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction (Betlach. M. et al., Nucleic Acids Res., in press). The * mRNA is complementary to the & mRNA for 13 residues near the 5' terminus. As with the & gene, translation begins at or near the 5' terminus of the mRNA and the 5' terminus of the mRNA is capable of forming a hairpin loop. The DNA sequences immediately upstream of the & and 9 genes have significant homology suggesting that they have common promoter and/or regulatory signals. mRNA indicate a significant increase under low oxygen tension, suggesting that the 9 and & genes are regulated to some extent at the level of transcription. was further characterized by constructing fusions of portions of the & gene to the 9 F",

Leeds, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, California 92717Although the foundation of our understanding of gene regulation comes from studies of the biochemical genetics of enzymes in a variety of netabolic pathways in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, most of the gene systems studied in metazoans have been non-catalytic structural genes which are terminal differentiation products. The 37E,C region on chromosome I1 in Drosophila contains a cluster of genes which affect cuticle formation and at least three genes which affect catechol and biogenic amine metabolism directly. At least one of these genes (dopa decarboxylase, Ddc) passes through five cycles of expression and repression in response to developmental and hormonal cues. The l(2)amd gene has been localized irrimediately adjacent to Ddc (0.002 map units) and like Ddc appears to affect cuticle formation and catechol metabolism. Genetic evidence sugeests that l(2)and and I)dc are required at similar stages of development. The gene structure, organization and transcription pattern of l(2)amd and & & are being examined in order to identify developmental regulatory sequences which they may share in common. These are being compared at the DNA sequence and functional levels.determined by examining 15 new transformed chromosomal locations of Ddc with respect to tissue and temporal regulation. The putative functional significance of the organization of this cluster of related genes is discussed.

Reue, S t u a r t Rich and Aldons J. expression system was used to study the role of the adenovirus late and SV40 early mRNA leader sequences and adenovirus virus-associated (VA) RNAs in mRNA translation. Hybrid transcription units containing the adenovirus late and SV40 early promoters fused to various coding regions were introduced into monkey COS cells on plasmids containing an SV40 origin of replication. The translational efficiencies of the mRNAs produced from these plasmids were determined after alterations in the viral leader sequences o r in the presence of VA RNAs provided by adenovirus infection of the transfected cells or by cotransfection with plasmids containing the VA genes. Efficient translation of mRNA with either adenovirus or SV40 leader sequences is dependent upon the presence of VA RNA. Translational stimulation by VA RNA of mRNAs containing the adenovirus tripartite leader sequences is dramatically reduced i f leader exons 2 and 3 are removed or i f their orientation is altered. Sequence analysis has indicated a homology between the nontranslated 5 ' end of SV40 early mRNA and sequences at the border of the 2nd and 3rd tripartite leader exons which m y be responsible for the increased translation of these mRNAs in the presence of VA RNA. 0981 HOST tRNA CLEAVAGE AND REUNION IN T4-INFECTED E.

Two transesterification reactions are involved in splicing. A free guanosine attacks at the 5' splice site, is covalently bound to the IVS and generates a 5' exon with a free3'  hydroxyl which then attacks at the 3' splice site, resulting in ligated exons and excised linear IVS. In a third transesterification reaction the guanosine at the 3' end of the linear IVS attacks at a site near the 5' end of the IVS. releasing an oligonucleotide and producing a circular IVS.

Zuber; the derivative contains a 2-base pair (bp) insertion at -17. This shifts the \u20ac & sequence 2 bp to the left so that the underlined l T G corresponds to the initial three nucleotides in the -35 consensus sequence, TTGACA. We find that, in contrast to wild-type FRE, the altered promoter is active in the absence of cII protein. Furthermore, cII protein substantially represses transcription, presumably because the 2-bp insertion positions the TTGC sequences in such a way that 211-binding prevents recognition of the -35 region by RNA polymerase. The concentrations of 511 protein required for maximal repression of the mutant promoter and maximal activation of the wild-type promoter are the same. Thus, insertion of 2 bp provides a way of assaying the effects of mutations on FII-binding independent of their possible effects on transcription initiation once 111 protein has bound. To this end, we are constructing derivatives of the promoter having both the 2-bp insertion and a previously-isolated ~y (P ) mutation. Of particular interest are mutations that appear to affect both yII-bind# and subsequent initiation by RNA polymerase. f mom r e q u i r e s the host Dam methylase a c t i v i t y (methylates A i n GATC sequences) and a --acting phage gene f u n c t i o n (designated Dad).

CODOMINANT ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE MUTATIONS IN RIBOSOMAL RNA GENES OF ESCHERICHXA COLI. Curt Sigmund. Mohamed Ettayebi. and Edward A. Morgan. Roswell Park Memorial Institute. Buffalo. New York 14263. Ribosomal RNA operons of L a have not been extensively analyzed by genetics because of a lack of dominant selectable mutations in these operons. Mutations in rRNA operons have probably been difficult to isolate because there are seven rRNA operons in E s d i . Therefore. mutations in rRNA genes might escape detection because the mutations a r e recessive or alter only a s m a l l fraction of the ribosomes. A n rRNA operon ( -1 cloned on a multicopy plasmid increases the contribution of a single rRNA operon to ribosomes and allows isolation of codominant mutations in 165 and 23s ribosomal RNA genes. One mutation at position 2058 of a 23s RNA gene confers resistance to macrolide. lincosamide. and streptogramin type B antibiotics. T w o other mutations which are located nearby confer resistance to a subset of the macrolide antibiotics and to chloramphenicol. A mutation at position 1192 of a 165 RNA gene confers resistance to spectinomycin. The alterations in 23s RNA are in a region involved in peptidyl transfer. The alterations in 16s RNA are in a region which m a y be involved in translocation.

These enhancers are very cell type specific, since cloned functionally rearranged Ig a l l e l e s are transcribed correctly and e f f i c i e n t l y only when introduced into lymphoid c e l l s . This suggests the presence of cell type specific gene products which can activate an enhancer from a s i l e n t t o a functional transcriptional control element.

W e assume t h a t these sequences are expressed in B-cell populations in which the kappa gene i s transcribed b u t not i n kappa mRNA negative B-cells.

An enhancer was identified in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA by co-transfecting cloned DNA from the immediate early region of HCMV with an \"enhancer trap\" of linear simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA lacking its own enhancer. Two replication competent SV40-like viruses were isolated containing HCMV DNA inserts of 341 and 262 bp. These sequences are located upstream of the major immediate early promoter, between nucleotides -118 and -524. Transient expression assay with a cloned rabbit E-globin gene indicated that the upstream region of the major immediate early gene of HCMV contains the strongest enhancer element identified so far. Studies with deletion mutants showed that different subsets of this enhancer can substitute for the SV40 enhancer. Studies with more extended deletions and various fusion genes are in progress.",

Carrard, The U n i v e r s i t y of Texas Health Science Center at Dallas, Dallas, Tx. 75235 We have investigated at high resolution the chromatin structure of the locus containing a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene that encodes an 81 kd heat shock protein (the homolog of orthern hybridization enables us to determine that within 10 min of k?'!%%%) t h 2 s t e a d y state level of HSP83 transcript is induced at least tenfold over the basal level (27O). DNase I and micrococcal nuclease cutting sites in nuclei isolated from either heat shock induced or uninduced cells were mapped along the HSP83 locus by indirect end-labeling. A persistent set of nuclease hypersensitive features= noted. Regions 2.150 bp in breadth that are hypersensitive to DNase I are centered at -1625 bp, -545 bp, -155 bp, +2400 bp, and +3375 bp relative to the transcription start. The DNase I sites (except +2400 bp) each display centrally located protected regions of 20-40 bp, implying the presence o f DNA binding proteins.The Pelham heat shock consensus sequence lies within a protected subdomain o f the site at -155 bp. Sequences corresponding to poly(A) addition and possibly transcription termination reside within the site at +2400 bp. A clear array of DNA sequence-positioned nucleosomes, detectable by either nuclease, resides 3' to the DNase I hypersensitive region a t +3375 bp; a similar array may exist 5' to the site at -1625 bp. These two hypersensitive reoions are also each demarcated 5 ' and 3' by exceptionally strong micrococcal nuclease cleavages % 160 bp apart, a length which coincides with the canonical nucleosomal repeat. By infecting murine embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines with a recombinant transducing virus that contains neomycin resistance gene ( = ) linked to Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) LTR, we have isolated clonal lines that are resistant to the neomycin analogue, G418.These transductant lines consist of undifferentiated EC cells as judged by morphology, tumorigenicity and cell surface antigenic markers.Analysis of the integrated neo sequence by Southern blot hybridization revealed that some of the lines have single copies whereas others have multiple copies in multiple sites.Although these transductant lines contained many copies of helper M-MuLV integrated in the cellular genome, expression of their genes was not detected either by reverse transcriptase activity or by XC plaque assay. Two F9tk-transductant lines were superinfected with a second recombinant transducing virus that contains herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene flanked by the M-MuLV LTR. The frequency of transduction to yield clones able to grow in HAT medium was similar to that of the parental cells. These results suggest that the expression of the K O gene linked to M-MuLV LTR in the trnasductant EC cell clones is due to a cis-acting mechanism: e.g., rearrangement of the enhancer sequence in M-MuLV LTR or effect by a cellular enhancer element flanking the integrated recombinant gene.To investigate these possibilities, the inregrated recombinant gene has been cloned together with its flanking cellular sequences, 2nd their structures are being analyzed.
