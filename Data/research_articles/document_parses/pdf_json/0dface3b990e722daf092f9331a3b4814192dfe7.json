The study human subjects were selected from two imaging-based severe asthmatic clusters with one characterized by nonconstricted airways and the other by constricted airways in the lower left lobe (LLL). We compared the deposition fractions of sodium chloride (NaCl) particles with a range of aerodynamic diameters (1-8 \u00b5m) in cluster archetypes under conditions with and without hygroscopic growth. The temperature and water vapor distributions in the airways were simulated with an airway wall boundary condition that accounts for variable temperature and water vapor evaporation at the interface between the lumen and the airway surface liquid layer.",

A better understanding of the aerosol-water vapor interaction in the airways could potentially help the design of effective inhalers that engineer the aerosol size for targeted drug delivery (Byron, 2004; Longest, Tian, Walenga, & Hindle, 2012; Walenga & Longest, 2016) .",

            "text": "Recent studies have focused on the shrinkage or growth of particles for various airway conditions and its impact on the deposition of drugs in the airways (Chen, Feng, Zhong, & Kleinstreuer, 2017; Chen, Kleinstreuer, Zhong, Feng, & Zhou, 2018; Longest, McLeskey, & Hindle, 2010) . However, tailoring efficient drug delivery methods and devices for asthmatic patients poses numerous experimental challenges due to inaccuracy in measuring and quantifying the regional deposition of particles (dosage) in the airways (Borgstr\u00f6m, Bengtsson, Derom, & Pauwels, 2000) . Although several computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies have been performed for particle growth in the mouth-throat and airway model, very few have focused on the effect of subject-specific airways with realistic boundary conditions (Chen et al., 2017; Chen, Ma, Zhong, Sun, & Zhou, 2019; Winkler-Heil, Ferron, & Hofmann, 2014; . The change in the size of pharmaceutical particles is due to evaporation and condensation (hygroscopicity) when traveling in the respiratory tract (Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Finlay, 2001) . During the hygroscopic process of a sodium chloride (NaCl) particle, water vapor would be absorbed from surrounding air to form a film of saturated NaCl solution that covers a NaCl crystal (Asgharian, 2004; Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Chen et al., 2017) . As the hygroscopic process continues, the mass of solid NaCl decreases and the saturated NaCl solution increases until solid NaCl is fully dissolved (Asgharian, 2004; Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Chen et al., 2017) . Several previous works on the growth of hygroscopic particles in the human airways showed that an increase in particle size enhances the particle deposition throughout the airways (Chen et al., 2019; Ferron, Kreyling, & Haider, 1988; Ferron, Oberd\u00f6rster, & Henneberg, 1989; Hofmann, 2011; Martonen, 1982) . For example, Ferron et al. (1989) found that for particles with an initial diameter of 0.5-2 \u03bcm in a constant relative humidity (RH) environment, the hygroscopic process could significantly alter the particle size by a factor of 2 to 4. Chen et al. (2017) tested the hygroscopic growth of multi-component particles, comprising water, ethanol, NaCl and fluorescein, in a generalized mouth-throat model with various boundary conditions at the inlet and boundary walls, such as volumetric flow rate and wall wetness. They found that for particles with an initial diameter of 2.5-7.5 \u03bcm a wet wall (RH = 99.5%) condition increases the deposition efficiency by 2.1%, as compared with 0.5% obtained with a dry airways wall condition (RH = 0%). In a numerical study of hygroscopic particle growth of NaCl, Chen et al. (2019) reported that a constant RH of 99.5% at the airway wall overpredicted the final particle diameter by 18% in the airways of generation 3-6, indicating the importance of this boundary condition.",

Thus, the notion of subject-specificity for tailoring drug delivery could potentially be realized through cluster-specificity. For example, Choi et al. (2017) identified four asthmatic clusters using computed tomography (CT) imaging-based variables and established their associations with clinical characteristics. Later, J. Choi et al. (2019) applied a CFD model to examine air flow and deposition of non-growth particles within archetypes representative of the four imaging-based clusters. Although subjects in cluster 3 (without airway constriction) and cluster 4 (with airway constriction) were characteristic of severe asthma, they exhibited different particle deposition patterns with increasing initial particle size. Specifically, cluster 4 subjects had an increase in the deposition fraction in the left lower lobe (LLL) for particles with a diameter larger than 2 \u03bcm.",

Most of the existing studies assumed a wet wall condition where the temperature (37\u2160 C) and relative humidity (RH = 99.5%) were fixed at the airways wall (Asgharian, 2004; Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Ferron et al., 1988; Longest et al., 2012) . A fixed airway wall temperature or using simple function of distance from mouth may lead to inaccurate prediction of temperature distribution within the airway since during inspiration the airway wall is cooled due to evaporation and heat transfer (Winkler-Heil et al., 2014; . The wall boundary conditions for Equations (3) and (4) and humidity are transferred to the air from the airway wall until isothermal saturation is reached (Wu et al., 2014) . For Equations (3) and (4), a Dirichlet boundary condition of 303 K and RH = 35% was imposed at the entrance of the trachea. At the end of the terminal bronchioles, a Neumann condition was imposed (Wu et al., 2014) . Once the velocity, temperature, and water vapor concentration (absolute humidity) fields were obtained, the particle transport and growth models described in the following sections were solved.",

The growth ratio here was calculated by taking the equilibrium particle diameter $L * ' and dividing by the initial particle diameter $L w1\" '. The model prediction at both conditions shows an increase of growth ratio with increasing initial particle diameter. The predicted growth ratios here are for a fixed RH = 99% (solid black circle) and RH = 99.5% (solid black square). Previous studies showed that a small change in relative humidity (RH > 98%) could significantly impact the growth ratio and the time to reach the equilibrium size (Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Haddrell et al., 2017; Winkler-Heil et al., 2014) . The discrepancies between the model prediction and experimental data are due to several factors. First, the growth ratio shown in Figure 2 heavily depends on the RH, which was measured by W. with an accuracy of 1% as RH approaches 100%. As shown in Figure 2 , a change in RH by 0.5% increased the growth ratio by approximately ~1.0, when the initial particle diameter was fixed at 200 nm. Second, the sensitivity of particle growth model discussed above to thermophysical properties such as diffusion coefficient $ Z Q ', thermal conductivity $ i Z u ', and saturation vapor pressure $5 .Q,Sr7 ' are well-studied, indicating a difference in growth ratio about ~1.45 using thermophysical properties from various studies (Broday & Georgopoulos, 2001; Chen et al., 2017) .

A slight decrease in local water vapor concentration is associated with an increase in airflow speed and a decrease in temperature. The water vapor concentration in the airways has a greater impact on the particle trajectory since different water vapor concentration may lead to different particle size, which subsequently affects the deposition site in the airways due to size change and particle momentum. Figure 4 compares the average DF values for the C3 and C4 subjects with and without (constant particle diameter) hygroscopic particle growth for various initial particle diameters for a simulation time of 1.25 s. The average DF increases as the initial particle size varied from 1 to 8 \u03bcm since the particles that would be advected deeper into the airways now deposited on the airway wall. This is true for both cases with and without hygroscopic particle growth. As expected, with particle growth, the average DF increases. The difference in DFs between with and without growth is most evident for particles with an initial diameter of 4 \u03bcm, viz. about 3% in the C3 subjects and 6% in the C4 subjects. Comparing the average DF between the C3 subjects (Figure 4(a) ) and the C4 subjects (Figure 4 (b)) for all initial particle diameters, on average, the C4 subjects have higher DF values because of constriction in the C4 subjects. In addition, the average growth ratio decreases from about 2.0 to 1.15, with increasing initial particle size from 1 to 8 \u03bcm, which was computed for all particles that were deposited or advected to the outlet. In Figure 4 , the decrease in growth ratio was observed due to a lower surface to volume ratio, which slowed the response of particles in a humid environment. In order to test the effect of particle release time, we compared the deposition fractions for subjects with constriction. We released monodispersed particles with initial diameters ranging from 1 to 8 \u03bcm at 0.3 s. Our findings showed an increase in deposition fraction about 3.5%-5.0% compared to releasing all the particles at the initial time. The increase in deposition fraction is due to the turbulent intensity experienced by particles at a later time. Our observation suggests that releasing a fixed number of particles at each time, will likely increase the deposition for particles released closer to the peak inhalation time. The increase in deposition occurs since higher velocity leads to more inertia.",

Thus, this highlights the importance of using subject-specific geometry and ventilation. In a previous study, Wu et al. (2014) proposed dimensionless correlations based on local flow rate (fN) , local airways diameter ( r ) and trachea diameter ( 7 ). n increases. The altered local mass and heat transfer in the fluid phase are linked to the particle phase via equations (9) and (13). The effect of the constriction can be seen in Figure 6 . For the C4 subjects, the local flow velocities increases in the constriction (Figure 3) , the particles entering the constriction experienced more inertia, which causes the particles to deposit at the constriction. Even though higher Nu LLL and Sh LLL are observed at the constriction (C4), the particle-water vapor interaction time is lower in the constriction, which indicates smaller deposited particle diameter (Figure 6(b) ). This effect does not occur in the C3 subjects due to the lower flow velocities at LLL. For C3 subjects, the particles entering LLL gains mass via condensation, and the final deposited particle diameters are larger, see Figure 6 (a). Thus, this highlights the importance of predicting water evaporation at the airways wall, since the mass of water transferred to the particle surface depends upon the humidity of the surrounding air. In Table \u2160 , Pearson's correlation analysis for Nu LLL and Sh LLL with deposition fractions in LLL are shown, which indicates a strong positive correlation for deposition fraction for 1 \u03bcm case (r = 0.98, p < 0.001 ) and 2 \u03bcm (r = 0.96, p < 0.001). The initial particle diameter increases the correlation (Nu LLL and Sh LLL ) decreases (Table \u2160) , which is due to lower growth rates for larger particle diameters, as shown in Figure 4 . The trend is observed due to the simulation time of 1.25 s (single inhalation), where larger particles require a longer time to reach equilibrium. Airway constriction found in the C4 subjects leads to lower particle delivery to the peripheral airways, which may limit the performance of asthma inhalers.",

First, the subject-specific airway geometry was reconstructed from CT images, and the associated subject-specific inhalation capacity was computed using image registration. Furthermore, the boundary condition imposed at the terminal CT-resolved 3D airways for the 3D CFD simulation was computed based on a 1D resistance model, which could reflect the effect of local airway constriction in asthmatic subjects. Second, we employed a two-layer wall boundary condition to account for evaporation at the ASL-lumen interface. Third, we focused on investigating the hygroscopic effect in two distinct severe asthmatic subgroups, one without airway constriction and the other with constriction. It is noted that the cluster-specific structural and functional features are not detectable by clinical spirometry. These results could potentially inform the choice of particle size for inhalational drug delivery in a cluster-specific manner.",

            "text": "The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of hygroscopic NaCl particle deposition fraction in CT-based subject-specific airway models from imaging-based severe asthmatic clusters. The impact of hygroscopic particle growth was compared with non-growth particles by computing the total deposition fraction values in each subject. The effect of particle growth on the DF in severe asthmatic subjects with non-constricted airway diameter was overall less than in subjects with constricted airways. The effect of hygroscopic particle growth model was evaluated by taking the differences in average DF for the cases with and without growth. For C4 subjects, the hygroscopic particle growth with a fixed initial particle diameter of 2 \u03bcm contributed more to the DF, which is approximately 3.5% higher in the LLL. The higher DF in the C4 subjects is due to the local conditions such as reduced airway diameter, velocity, temperature, and available water vapor. It is important to note that the choice of using either the growth model or no-growth model is much more important for C4 subjects than C3 cluster subjects. Predicting accurate temperature and water vapor concentration in the airways is crucial for computing hygroscopic particle growth and deposition fraction, especially in severe asthmatic subjects with airway narrowing. Utilizing cluster-specific imaging-based features to group severe asthmatic subjects into clusters such as airways constriction may help tailor clusterspecific hygroscopic drug treatment for improving inhalation drug delivery. The proposed CFD lung model with hygroscopic particle growth has potential applications for studies related to exposure to tobacco cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, environmental particulate matters, and virus-laden aerosolized ambient particles, such as COVID-19.",
