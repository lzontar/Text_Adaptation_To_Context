Smart-Yoga Pillow (SaYoPillow) is envisioned as a device that may help in recognizing the importance of a good quality sleep to alleviate stress while establishing a measurable relationship between stress and sleeping habits. A system that analyzes the sleeping habits by continuously monitoring the physiological changes that occur during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages of sleep is proposed in the current work. In addition to the physiological parameter changes, factors such as sleep duration, snoring range, eye movement, and limb movements are also monitored. The SaYoPillow system is processed at the edge level with the storage being at the cloud. Not having to compromise the user's privacy, SaYoPillow proposes secure data transmission for both uploading and retrieving, and secure storage and communications as an attempt to reduce malicious attacks on healthcare. A user interface is provided for the user to control data accessibility and visibility. SaYoPillow has 96% accuracy which is close to other existing research works. However, SaYoPillow is the only work with security features as well as only work that considers sleeping habits for stress.",

Acute stress is mostly short and brief stress, while episodic acute stress is the repetition in the frequency of occurrence of acute stress. Chronic stress is categorized as follows: the wear and tear of stress response for being activated more than once for a small period of time, the habituation of stress to the human, failing to go back to the normal state from the stress state, prolonged exposure and inability to respond normally to stress, i. e. inadequate response. Prolonged exposure to chronic stress has many health hazards which include obesity, insomnia, diabetes, depression and sometimes even cancer [2] .",

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act proposes not only safeguarding the patients' information, providing integrity, confidentiality, individuality, respect, dignity and worth but also maintaining a risk management algorithm to address in case of vulnerability. However, the number of breaches in the Healthcare Services are increasing at a high rate. There were 15 million and 32 million patient records which were compromised with 503 breaches in 2018 and 2019, respectively [7] . Thus an attempt to decrease the rate of increase in lack of security has also been addressed in this work. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the research questions addressed along with the motivation and objective of SaYoPillow. Section III surveys the state of the art and lists the issues with existing research. Section IV explains the vision of SaYoPillow, proposed solutions and novelties. Section V explains the relationship between stress and sleep along with its analytics. Section VI describes the training methodology used in SaYoPillow. Section VII describes the stress state detection during sleep and stress state prediction for the next day. Section VIII justifies the usage of the blockchain in healthcare. Section IX presents the experimental implementation and validation of SaYoPillow. Section X concludes the paper and presents possible future research.",

Another research which remotely monitors the respiratory rate of a person to detect stress is proposed in [22] . However just monitoring the respiration rate is not sufficient for accurate stress detection. Low frequency dielectric properties in human blood are studied to enhance the stress measurement efficiency in [23] . Similarly, the quality of EEG signal is enhanced to detect stress in [24] . However, these works do not explain the relationship between stress and sleep. A stress classification is proposed in [25] using Muse headband [26] and a wearable is proposed in [27] for the same. They don't focus much on stress detection and also lack the relationship between stress and good quality sleep. Using saliva, a study has been proposed to monitor cortisol levels [28] . This work did not study the importance of sleep with the variations of cortisol levels. All these research works do not focus on secure transmission and storage of data, thereby ignoring the privacy issues.",

A mobile application has been developed in [30] without using wearables for monitoring. There are wearables like the Xiaomi Mi [31] , Eversleep [32] , Dreem [33] , Fitbit [34] and Muse [26] which help in monitoring the sleeping habits of a person. Xiaomi helps in assisting users to have a peaceful sleep by monitoring their breathing patterns. Eversleep tracks sleep patterns using the pulse of a person. Dreem and Muse do not consider various physiological parameters that vary during sleep but they stimulate the slow wave signals to regulate sleep. Fitbit monitors the heart rate of a person to assess the quality of sleep. Some of the non-wearables that are available for regulating sleep are Beddit [35] , SleepScore Max [36] , and Eight [37] . Beddit and SleepScore Max focus on the snoring rate of a person and Eight tracks parameters such as temperature, breathing rate, humidity, heart rate and light levels for better sleep. However, most of the wearables and non-wearables which are mentioned here do not monitor all the physiological changes during sleep and they do not provide a relationship with stress and sleep. A few of the most commonly used devices are given in Table I . All these wearables and non-wearables do not have a secured method for the transmission and storage of data that is used for detection.",

Sleep is categorized to two stages: non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) [43] . NREM occurs first and after a certain period it leads to deep sleep then followed by REM which is a relatively short period when compared to NREM. The sleep cycle of alternate NREM and REM stages takes an average of 90 minutes with a repetition of 4-6 times during the whole sleeping period. The NREM period is again classified in three stages where stage 3 is deep sleep stage. The pattern of the sleep cycle is represented in the Fig. 5 . The REM sleep is observed when there is a shift in sleep stage to 1 or 2 in the NREM classification [44] . Soon after the REM stage, sleepers typically awaken from sleep. Unknowingly or without the sleeper's knowledge, a small amount of time during sleep is spent in a waking state. This waking state duration could be 0-1% for females while 0-2% for males [45] .",

This helps in monitoring the sleep stages performing electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain waves, oxygen levels in the blood, heart rate and breathing as well as eye and leg movements by performing electrooculography and electromyography respectively. Studies based on polysomnography have observed that an anticipation of increased demand may disrupt some physiological indicators of sleep, which includes a decrease in the period of slow wave sleep and an increase in the heart rate [46] . Mental capabilities such as learning, self-awareness and logical reasoning have been affected due to bad or low quality sleep [47] . There are studies that combine polysomnography with hormonal measurements to monitor the sleep patterns with physiological parameter variations [48] .",

Disturbed sleep has been associated with increased instances of sickness, burnout syndrome, persistent psycho-physiological insomnia and higher risk of occupational accidents [49] . Intrapersonal distress (experiencing anguish in ones mind) and self-reported feelings of loneliness have been linked to lower sleeping efficiency and poor sleep quality [50] , [51] . Studies show that socializing and having people around results in having a good quality of sleep [52] while being lonely or not socializing reduces the efficacy of sleep [53] . Frequent low quality or deprived sleep activates the stress hormone cortisol in the human body [49] . A recent study shows that lack of good quality sleep weakens the efficiency of the human body to produce enough proteins to fight infections and inflammations, thereby weakening the immune system [54] . Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and systolic blood pressure are a few of the other negative effects on the human body due to low good quality sleep [55] .",

Many physiological parameters tend to vary during the sleeping period. Snoring rate is measured in decibels as it is the sound that is produced when there is an unusual increase in the respiration rate per minute [56] , [41] . Snoring under 50dB can be considered normal, but when there is snoring at levels higher than 50dB, the chances of experiencing stress and other health issues are high [56] , [57] . Similarly, the respiration rate, or the number of breaths taken per minute, is considered to be healthy if it is between 15-17 breaths per minute (bpm), and respiration rate greater than this is indicative of stress [42] , [58] . In the same manner, the heart beats 5-10 times slower than the usual heart rate when a person is sleeping [59] . The heart rate is considered normal if the beats per minute (bpm) are 44-54 and considered abnormal if the bpm observed is greater than 54-64 [60] , [61] .

Brain activity on the EEG is observed as low-voltage, mixed frequency waves. In N2, i.e., after 10 to 25 minutes in the initial cycle, the brain waves are observed to have low voltage, mixed frequency but higher speed. While in N3, the deep sleep stage, the brain waves are observed to have high voltage, and slow wave activity [40] . In a similar way, during sleep, the temperature of the human body tends to fall during the NREM stages. A slight raise in temperature resulted in a dramatic increase of good sleep quality according to [64] . This fall in temperature is directly proportional to the period of duration in NREM stages. The lowest body temperature that a human can experience during sleep is 96.4 \u2022 F a few hours before waking up. If there is any temperature that is less than 92.3 \u2022 F and higher than 99.2 \u2022 F during sleep, it indicates low quality sleep which may lead to stress [6] . Similarly, during the NREM period, the limbs of the human experience rapid movements or jerks which may affect the quality of sleep. These movements tend to occur every 20 to 40 seconds per one NREM episode. A situation at which there are at least four serial movements lasting 0.5-10 seconds for every 5-90 second duration can be termed as Periodic Limb Movements in Sleep (PLMS). Studies show that the Periodic Limb Movement Index (PLMI), which is the frequency of PLMS per hour of total sleep time, is 15 for 5-8% of adults and increases with age [65] . Any number of movements greater than fifteen can cause improper sleep and can lead to stress.",

Repeat the steps from 5 through 10 until all the variables are assigned. 13 The individual output range specification from 0 through 5 is divided among 5 stress state levels as shown in Table II . 1) Data Processing in Fuzzy Logic Based Modeling: Once the input data is received as the physiological parameters, it is compared to the range of parameters with which the stress state of the user can be detected from Table III . After the data is in the range, then the stress state is assigned according to the input parameters. The detailed flow of data processing with an example is provided in the Algorithm 1 while the stress state detection and prediction are detailed in Section VII.",

The proposed blockchain solution uses RSA encryption for communication between the edge device, end users and admin nodes. Transaction processing in the proposed blockchain solution can be divided into two different steps as discussed in this Section. The proposed blockchain architecture that is used in SaYoPillow is represented in Fig. 17 . 1) Data uploading from SaYoPillow: Edge device in the SaYoPillow architecture is responsible for collecting physiological data which are used for detecting and predicting stress. The edge device creates a data upload request which will be sent to the admin node using a client program. The data upload request is strictly validated by the admin node using the access-policy smart contract. Once the user is validated, the admin node will acknowledge the request to the edge device which in turn uploads the gathered physiological and analyzed stress detection and prediction data. The data received by the admin node are published to the blockchain network. A smart contract is executed, and configured events are generated which will create logs in the blockchain ledger for auditing purposes. RSA encryption is used to securely transfer data between the blockchain and the edge device. The integrity of the requests is validated by using the digital signatures with the edge device private key and the public key of the admin node is used to maintain the confidentiality of the message in the communication channel. The process of uploading the data to the cloud from the edge device is detailed through Algorithm 5.",

Every time a new transaction is created for smart contract, a network of participants will execute the smart contract and come to an agreement. Smart contracts can also store application information.

The accuracy is approximately 96% for the model to detect the stress as shown in Fig. 11 . The stress prediction is performed at the UI by taking in the total stress levels detected every 15 minutes and comparing the observed stress levels, as detailed in Algorithm 4.

Transaction times mainly depend on the number of unconfirmed transactions in the transaction pool and the number of miners in the network. As we can see mean transaction times in private instances for all functions are lower than mean transaction times in the test network Ropsten. This is because of the unconfirmed transaction pool, as Ropsten is a public test network and has more transactions in the pool compared to private instances. The gas limit is maintained constant in both networks as transaction times will vary based on the offered gas price. SaYoPillow is configured to update the physiological data in intervals of 15 minutes, hence the number of access requests is very high compared to other data upload functions. This is an advantage as data access uses call methods and is retrieved in near real-time. Private instances are preferred in our implementation to enhance security by limiting the participants in the network to only authorized. One more advantage with a private Ethereum network is that the difficulty of mining can be set to acceptable values based on the application, to increase scalability and reduce stalling of transactions in an unconfirmed state for long time.

A brief comparison of SaYoPillow to the existing literature is presented in Table VI. X. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH Along with the stress monitoring and analysis during sleep, the importance of Smart-Sleeping is made understood to the user in SaYoPillow. The continuous monitoring of eight physiological signal data is processed in an edge device where five different classifications of stress is performed. The stress during sleep and stress prediction for the following next day are observed to be approximately 96% accurate by implementing a Fully Connected Neural Network Model using TensorFlow. The dataset size which was used is 15,000 samples, out of which 13,000 are used for training while 2,000 samples are used for testing. The loss is observed to be less than 1%. The fuzzy logic GUI has also been represented with a surface plot to allow the idea of extending this to develop a mobile application. The edge level implementation is done by feeding the device with the dataset and observing the analyzed stress state along with the instant physiological signal data in the monitor. This device was connected via Wi-Fi to directly send the analyzed information securely to the cloud for storage. The Ethereum blockchain was used as a cloud for storing the analyzed data. Every time the user received it, it is stored and analyzed information is displayed in the connected User Interface when the person is awake. The UI displays the average of the physiological signals for every 15 minutes throughout the sleeping period including the sleep latency periods, along with the detected stress level and its remedies for the user. The predicted stress level of the person along with its remedies are also displayed here.",
