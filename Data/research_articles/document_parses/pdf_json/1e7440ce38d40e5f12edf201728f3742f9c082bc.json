The increasing availability of HBV/C genetic sequences and detailed annotations provides an opportunity to investigate the epidemiological factors underlying its evolutionary history. In this study, the Bayesian phylogeography framework was used to investigate the origins and patterns in spatial dissemination of HBV/C by analyzing East Asian sequences obtained from 1992 to 2010. The most recent common ancestor of HBV/C was traced back to the early 1900s in China, where it eventually diverged into two major lineages during the 1930s-1960s that gave rise to distinct epidemic waves spreading exponentially to other East Asian countries and the USA. Demographic inference of viral effective population size over time indicated similar dynamics for both lineages, characterized by exponential growth since the early 1980s, followed by a significant bottleneck in 2003 and another increase after 2004. Although additional factors cannot be ruled out, we provide evidence to suggest this bottleneck was the result of limited human movement from/to China during the SARS outbreak in 2003. This is the first extensive evolutionary study of HBV/C in East Asia as well as the first to assess more realistic spatial ecological influences between co-circulating infectious diseases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary"}, {"text": "East Asia, HBV genotype C, human mobility, phylogeography, population bottleneck, SARS the different genotypes, except for genotypes D and G, which are scattered worldwide. 4 Genotype A is prevalent in Africa, North America and Europe; Genotypes B and C are the major genotypes circulating in Asia 4 and, even in the USA, are the most common among Asian patients 5 ; genotype E is prevalent in Africa; F/H in Central and South America; I in Taiwan; and J in Japan. 4, 6, 7 HBV genotype C (HBV/C), in particular, is the most prevalent genotype in almost every East Asian country, and it also accounts for a large number of infections in the USA (prevalence of 41% and 23% along the Western and Eastern coasts, respectively 5 ). In Korea, genotype C constitutes almost 100% of the infections, 8 approximately 50% in Hong Kong, 9 and 85% in Japan. 10 In Mainland China, genotype C is predominant in the Northern part of China (Beijing, Xingjiang and Gansu), while genotype B is prevalent in the Central and Eastern part of China (Hunan and Fujian), with an overall prevalence of 41% for genotype B and 53% for genotype C. 11 Similarly in Taiwan, where HBV genotype B is the most prevalent (68%), genotype C still accounts for almost one-third of the infections (32%). 12 and C4 in the Aborigines from Australia. 14 Chronic infection with HBV/C has been associated with significantly higher risk than with other genotypes for progression to LC and HCC. 15, 16 In Taiwan, in particular, chronic hepatitis and HCC are still the 9th ranking cause of death. 16 Indeed, several studies have suggested that disease outcomes are related to specific genetic variants. [17] [18] [19] Due to the disease activity and the risk of HCC development with which HBV/C is associated, it is important to investigate the molecular evolution and demographic history of this genotype in highly endemic countries notably the high prevalence of genotype C in USA and the prevalence (14.8%) of chronic HBV infections among Asian immigrants who likely acquired infections in their country of origin. 20 We consider this as an Asianrelated infection network, and therefore the HBV/C sequences from USA will be included in the study. Previous studies based on Bayesian coalescent analysis estimated the HBV evolutionary rate to be approximately 10 \u22124 -10 \u22125 nucleotide substitutions/site/ year 21, 22 and traced back the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the currently circulating human genotypes to ~1500 years ago, which in turn separated from the avian HBV lineage ~6000 years ago. 21 However, specific genotypes, or lineages within genotypes responsible for current outbreaks, may have a more recent origin, and their successful spread could be the result of specific historical or geopolitical correlates during the past decades potentially related to an unprecedented increase in human mobility.

Skygrid plots display changes in virus effective population size (Ne), which is a measure of viral diversity and is related to the number of new transmissions (incidence) over the sampling time period.38 The population demographic history, or changes in Ne over the evolutionary history in question, of lin-eages 2 and 3 was remarkably similar (Figure 5). Lineage 3 was characterized by overall viral effective population growth from 1980 to 1997 (a small and transient decrease was observed between 1989 and 1995) (Figure 5A). A sharp population bottleneck was then observed in 2003, followed by growth and potential stabilization (growing HPD intervals toward most recent sampling time) during the last decade (Figure 5A). Such a strong bottleneck usually associated with one or more than two major events relate to natural environment, human or epidemics. Coincidently, a wide affected emerging pathogen outbreak arose in East Asia in 2003. This newly emerging coronavirus caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), leading to an outbreak in the area between Hong Kong and Guangdong in 2003. The fast transmission and high mortality rate caused worldwide attention. With the WHO and governments' propaganda continuously advising people to avoid the attendance of public events and to change travel plans to epidemic areas such as China and Taiwan, 39 restrictions on tourism were tightened so as to reduce human contact. In order to analyse the potential impact of these travel restrictions on HBV/C spread, we collected travel numbers at customs in each East Asia country during the past three decades (Figure 6) for comparison with phylogeographic data.

The HBV/C population bottleneck occurred during the time frame of the SARS-CoV epidemic 40 and was followed by another substantial growth matching a new increase in human mobility in the aftermath of the SARS-CoV epidemic (Figure 5).Lineage 2 was characterized by fairly constant growth in viral Ne between 1975 and 2002, followed by two major bottlenecks (and eventual rebound): one in 2003 and a more recent one in 2009 (Figure 5B).

The strong HBV population bottleneck is confusing at first glance because there seems no appropriate explanation for any event leading to the major decline in East Asia around that time. However, SARS-CoV raised an outbreak in East Asia. It led to 774 deaths and 8098 infections and reached 30 countries in only a few months. 43 The fast transmission and high mortality rate (9.6%) 44 caused worldwide attention. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, hospitals with SARS cases and healthcare workers had been segregated. 45 Thousands of people had been isolated in hospitals including medical staff. People who had the possibility of being in contact with SARS patients were requested to be isolated in their homes. 46,47 Under this social atmosphere, community fairs and gatherings were reduced, not only in the general population but also in PWID (patients with injecting drugs) and MSM (men having sex with men). Human contact and international population flow (eg, travel) are important factors in the genetic diversity supply to a blood-transmitted virus such as HBV. When the effective population lacks income for a while, this would then be sharply reflected in phylodynamic analysis. Human-contactcaused environmental pressure for virus Ne is too hard to prove, but the pressure has left a trace on travelling numbers in every East Asia country. While the overall Ne of the virus has been increasing over the past three decades, at least two of the major co-circulating lineages of genotype C (one mainly spreading in Japan and Korea, the other one in China and Taiwan) experienced a significant viral population bottleneck around 2003 at the time of the SARS-CoV outbreak in China. The analysis of human mobility data showed that, indeed, during the SARS-CoV emergency, population movements in East Asia were strongly correlated with viral Ne fluctuation. The relatively limited decrease in the number of foreigners entering Japan and Korea may be due to the absence of Japan and Korea in the list of WHO travel advice recipients, also potentially explaining the moderate statistical correlation with the Ne of lineage 2.

HBV/C and SARS-CoV infect human hosts through very different routes (airborne vs mainly sexual contact), but human mobility reflected the influence on the host of co-expansion of HBV from the spread of SARS-CoV. In this particular case, the restriction on human mobility caused by the rapid dissemination of SARS-CoV may have resulted in a temporary decrease in the HBV/C effective population size. In other words, our data indicate that the co-circulation of two pathogens targeting the same human population resulted in a complex dynamic wherein one outbreak effectively down-modulated the other. A stochastic model of pathogen competition, co-circulating in a spatially structured environment, has recently been proposed. 49 By simulating two pathogens spreading through a travelling network with a stochastic mechanistic approach, the model investigated several complex scenarios where \"ecological factors,\" such as host mobility, could be either noninfluential for the competition dynamics or play a critical role in selecting the dominant pathogen. The development of more realistic spatial ecology models of multiple, cocirculating infectious diseases, as well as the monitoring and analysis of potentially competing epidemics, should be, therefore, a major focus for next-generation epidemiology studies. This is the first study depicting the evolutionary history of HBV/C in East Asia. By using state-of-the-art phylogeography techniques, we show that distinct HBV epidemic lineages emerged from China during the 1930s-1960s and spread exponentially across different Eastern Asian countries in the following decades. Demographic inference of viral effective population size over time indicated similar dynamics for both lineages, characterized by exponential growth since the early 1980s, followed by a significant bottleneck in 2003 and another increase after 2004. We first speculated that the host co-expansion virus population was influenced by strict restriction of population movement from/to China during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003. Given the continuous challenge of emerging and reemerging pathogens in the 21st century globalized world, our results highlight the need for the development of more realistic spatial ecology models of multiple co-circulating infectious diseases.ACK N OWLED G EM ENTSThis study was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (grant NSC 102-2917-I-019-001)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Several sub-genotypes with specific molecular epidemiology patterns have been described within HBV/C.
