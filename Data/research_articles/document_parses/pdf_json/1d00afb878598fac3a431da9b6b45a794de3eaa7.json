The 419 specimens were tested for antibody to human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antibody titers were found to increase with age, and titers as well as frequency of rises were greater for OC43 than for 229E virus in all age groups. Significant antibody rises were most frequent in specimens bracketing the winter interval, but some also occurred in the spring-summer and summer-fall intervals. Concurrent significant antibody rises to OC43 virus in different members of the same family were observed in 15 instances, to 229E virus in seven instances, and to OC43 virus in some members and 229E virus in others in eight instances. Significant antibody rises to OC43 or 229E virus indicating reinfections were frequently observed throughout the three-year period but were always separated by at least two four-month intervals. Concurrent significant antibody rises to both 229E and OC43 viruses were seen only in three persons. Finally, the frequency of significant antibody rises in children, about one per person-year, was almost three times higher than in adults.",

Antibody rises were expressed as ELISA ratios, which were defined as the ratios of maximum to minimum optical densities between sequential serum specimens at the same dilution. ELISA ratios of 1.8 or greater (i.e., a 1.8-fold increase in optical density) were accepted as indicating significant rises.

The 419 sera tested were distributed according to the age of the donor when blood samples were collected and the geometric mean titers for each age group were calculated. As seen in table 1, the geometric mean titers increased directly with age. Also, in each age group, the geometric mean titer for OC43 virus exceeded that for 229E virus, the relative difference decreasing with age from 2.8-fold (0-4 years) to 1.2-fold (adults).",

This ratio was accepted based on its correlation with fourfold or greater rises in virus neutralizing and complementfixing antibody titers in paired sera from 200 unrelated persons. ELISA ratios of between 1.5 and 1.8 also probably represented increases in specific antibody levels since many of these correlated with fourfold rises in virus neutralizing antibody titers and, in this study, 18 of 32 occurred in family clusters of two or more or coincidentally with 1.8 ratios in other family members.
