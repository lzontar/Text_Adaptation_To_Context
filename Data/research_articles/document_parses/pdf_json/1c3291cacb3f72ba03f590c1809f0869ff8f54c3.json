Overall success in meeting targets has been low and is not uniform by region nor by target. For instance, in Africa, none of the 50 countries convention parties are on course to meet Targets 3, 4, 12 or 20 at all by 2020, and even the most on-track Targets (16 & 17) are only expected to be achieved by 24% of these countries (IPBES 2018) . Such an uneven achievement of targets translates to an imbalance in biodiversity conservation, sustainable use, and benefit sharing-the three objectives of the CBD. This situation in Africa is widely representative of the negative trends for global biodiversity in the Anthropocene (IPBES 2019).",

Given limited success of two decades of CBD target-setting policies, starting from the 2010 Targets set in 2002, adopting another set of numerical biodiversity targets would seem best avoided. Numerical targets, even under a unified single metric (e.g. Rounsevell et al. 2020) , distract and divert resources from effective implementation. Instead, a successful GBF must be a framework from which policies are developed and implemented urgently and effectively at local, national, and regional scales. It must overcome the difficulty of accommodating multiple and complex concerns of all stakeholders from environmental, societal, economic and political domains and meet needs of people and biodiversity. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment (IPBES 2019) calls for transformative approaches to biodiversity governance-here we propose four promising ways the GBF could be transformative for people and the rest of biodiversity.",

To calculate these percentages requires robust biodiversity threat assessments and poses substantial implementation challenges for member states with insufficient capacity. The same challenges also apply for gene and ecosystem metrics used in the Zero Draft. Indeed, while metrics to measure the state of biodiversity exist and some are even well established (Mace et al. 2018) , without the reliable ability to assess biodiversity in the first instance in many regions of the world, it serves as a 'paper target'.",

The 2030 and 2050 goals in the GBF, focusing on biodiversity status (defined by species health, human use and equitable sharing of resources) can be readily adapted from numerical targets to 'vectors of change'. CBD Parties have the opportunity to define country-level ambition (Maron et al. 2020 ) that reflect their needs and capacities. At the global level, use of narratives encapsulating biodiversity as the CBD defines it-hierarchical linkage of genes, species and ecosystems-is the best way forward. Through the GBF (via e.g. the Global Environment Facility) the global community must commit to ensure all CBD Parties have appropriate capacity (i.e. expertise, technology, facilities etc.).

Use of predetermined activities in the Zero Draft of the GBF, e.g. protected areas (Section D, a2), is not always conducive for promoting collaboration among human communities with different interests. This is evidenced by Aichi Targets 6 ''Sustainable Fisheries'' & 11 ''Protected Areas''. Indeed, Aichi Target 11 explicitly describes the implementation of more protected areas ''to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services'', which in the marine context includes fisheries. In practice, however, more protected areas is not always in the interests of biodiversity users (De Santo 2013). Considerable debate still exists how protected areas should be implemented even after a decade of Aichi Targets (Visconti et al. 2019; Woodley et al. 2019) .",

For example, a focus on marine systems, rather than separate targets on sustainable fisheries and marine protected areas, will encourage more effective conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity. Mobile marine protected areas (Maxwell et al. 2020) can be expanded to include parameters encompassing fisher needs and other CBD objectives as well as traditional protected area objectives. Promoting collective action by fisheries for conservation has precedence, with as extreme example being the role of the International Whaling Commission through its global moratorium on commercial whaling. This effective intervention halted commercial whaling, albeit addressing a self-inflected threat, and led to increases in most whale species populations, including the highly-endangered blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus).",
