This can obscure variation in cytokine expression patterns within individuals. Further, the relatively high dimensionality of cytokine data can make it difficult to detect statistically significant associations due to high false discovery rates. Additionally, the distinct distributions in our cohorts between severe and mild patients complicate simple overall comparisons. To address this, we utilized a data-driven modular informatics approach (17) to identify clusters of co-regulated cytokines across all subjects, to normalize cytokine expression within subjects, and to identify differences in expression across conditions while adjusting for the effects of age and days after symptom onset for sampling. These analyses allowed us to detect a number of co-correlating cytokines across COVID-19 and influenza samples, which we grouped into distinct co-expression modules using hierarchical clustering (Supplementary Figure  4) . Of particular interest were Modules 1 and 2, which included GCSF, IFN-\u03b3, and IL1-\u03b2 (MOD1) and Eotaxin, HGF, IL1-Ra, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IP10, MCP1, MIG, and VEGF (MOD2), respectively. Upon constructing logistic models to assess associations between these cytokines and a binary infection status (COVID-19 vs. influenza), we observed that lower levels of both MOD1 and MOD2, as well as a number of their constituent cytokines, were significantly associated with an increased risk of being COVID-19 positive (Fig 2A) .

Furthermore, the logistic model specifically regresses out potentially confounding covariates that are otherwise obscured by simple univariate analysis. These results suggest that overall higher inflammation is foremost predictive of influenza infection and that a defining feature of COVID-19 disease is generally reduced inflammation compared to influenza as measured by a number of related cytokines. Thus, influenza infection was associated with generally higher levels of inflammation, and when influenza subjects exhibited high expression in one MOD2 cytokine, they were likely to exhibit high expression across the board.

More exhaustive analysis using gene ontology pathways related to interferon production, secretion, response, and regulation demonstrated that these patterns extended to IFN-\u03b2 and general Type I interferon pathways across most subsets, but particularly among monocytes (Supplementary Figure 8) .

We have demonstrated that the immunophenotype of COVID-19 and influenza patients vary widely. Two forms of COVID-19 immune dysregulation were observed: a cytokine storm phenotype in a small proportion of patients (3 of 79) and a far more common phenotype characterized by targeted immunosuppression. The signatures of this common COVID-19 phenotype were highly elevated IL-6 and IL-8, paired with lower levels (compared to severe influenza) of cytokines in many other pathways and essentially the absence of any Type I or Type II IFN response. The suppression in Type I IFN signaling has been noted by others in humans and animal models of COVID-19 infections (18, 19) . At the cellular level, dramatic reductions in overall cellularity and particularly in the monocyte compartment were observed, with phenotypic and transcriptional evidence (Class II downregulation) that monocytes were less activated. While lymphocyte numbers (except for plasmablasts) were reduced in both infected groups compared to healthy controls, several lymphocyte subsets had functional signatures of suppression in COVID-19 patients, including type I and II IFN signaling. IFN-\u03b3 production is critical for effector type I responses, and its absence may limit antiviral activity.

These results, combined with the targeted, severe suppression of specific pathways and dramatic leuko-and lymphopenia led us to consider what pathways might account for this response profile. Previous studies in animal models had implicated glucocorticoid (GC) signaling in the immunosuppression and lymphopenia that occurs in the influenza model in mice. (21) In humans, systemic inflammation, and hydrocortisone specifically, are known to suppress HLA-DR expression on monocytes. (22) Excessive GC production is an attractive hypothesis to account for the observed immune dysregulation and disease manifestations in COVID-19. First, the high levels of IL-6 production-one of the two cytokines that were higher in COVID-19 than in severe influenzacan directly drive excessive cortisol production through multiple mechanisms, including through the direct induction of corticotropin-releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropin. IL-6 can also act directly on the adrenal cortex to stimulate GC release.(23) While GCs are generally immunosuppressive, which is why they are often considered therapeutically, their effects are uneven across the cytokine landscape, with cortisol failing to suppress IL-6(24), or even inducing IL-6 and IL-8 in one report. (25) Notably, in this study there were differences in cortisol's effects between male and female cells, with more pro-inflammatory effects observed in males; male sex has been noted as a consistent risk factor in COVID-19.(26) A recent retrospective cohort study from Germany has also reported increased cortisol levels in a majority of COVID-19 patients. (27) Another potential source of cortisol production unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection is through its modulation of ACE2 levels. ACE2 is the receptor for virus entry, and while it is still unclear the extent to which its levels are modulated by infection, experience from SARS-CoV-1 and other data suggest that ACE2 expression or activity are lowered. This directly affects the renin-angiotensin system, enhancing ACE activity and resulting in a shift towards angiotensin II (Ang II) production and away from angiotensin 1-7. Ang II enhances Il-6 and cortisol production, while Ang 1-7 suppresses them. (28, 29) Beyond considering the potential impacts of increased GC production on the development of the immunosuppressed phenotype we characterized in the vast majority of COVID-19 patients in this study, we must also consider the possibility that GCs modulate the immune microenvironment differently in the context of distinct viral encounters. There are known but underappreciated immunosuppressive features of influenza (30) (31) (32) ; coronaviruses are similarly known to utilize a number of nonstructural proteins to disrupt host gene expression and protein synthesis (33, 34) , with the potential for profound impacts on various immune signaling pathways (35) . Although the details of these mechanisms in the context of COVID-19 immune dysregulation remain to be fully elucidated, our own analyses demonstrate enhanced GC signaling in cells from COVID-19 patients, consistent with an enhanced production of GCs or enhanced sensitivity to GCs after infection. Together these data suggest a feedforward amplification of IL-6 and GC signaling, paired with a profound suppression of other potentially protective immune functions through GC-induced apoptosis and suppression of key antiviral pathways. GCs can also drive other pathological phenotypes including clotting dysfunction, consistent with severe manifestations of COVID-19.(36) The direct and indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2's unique biology may determine this pathological outcome. Therapeutic consideration should be given to inhibiting both IL-6 and GC activity in the majority of COVID-19 patients exhibiting this phenotype (high IL-6, low IFN signaling, profound cytopenias) versus the small proportion of patients with a true cytokine storm phenotype. While inhibiting GC activity alone may cause excessive inflammation, co-administration with IL-6-blocking antibodies in a dose regulated manner may limit these effects. These data also indicate that administration of GCs would potentially be deleterious, an outcome consistent with some limited reports. (37) Other studies have indicated beneficial or neutral effects from GC, and indicate a focus on understanding their dynamics and activity across the course of infection is an important direction for future research.

The top 2,000 variable genes were identified for each library using the \"vst\" method, and integration anchors were obtained using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Data were integrated using 50 CCA dimensions and scaled to regress out the effects of total transcript count, percent of mitochondrial gene expression, and module scores associated with cell phase. Principal components (PC) were calculated and assessed for statistical significance using random permutation. The first 51 PCs (p < 0.01) were used to identify transcriptional clusters and for tSNE and UMAP dimensionality reduction. After identifying clusters on the basis of transcriptional similarities across cells from all three conditions (i.e., the \"integrated\" analysis), we performed pairwise differential gene expression analysis between conditions using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests as implemented in Seurat, with default parameters. We also generated an additional UMAP projection using the top 2,000 variable genes across the entire dataset (excluding TCR and IG genes, which are known to map poorly) irrespective of the CCA but again using significant PCs; this allowed us visualize cells in a manner that did not obscure transcriptional differences owed to sample or condition but with previously identified cell subsets and transcriptional clusters from the integration analysis overlaid. We also looked within identified subsets and clusters for explicit differences in gene pathway enrichment between cells from COVID-19-infected and influenza-infected patients, COVID-19-infected and healthy patients, and influenza-infected and healthy patients. For these analyses, gene expression differences between conditions were ranked for individual subsets and transcriptional clusters by calculating differential expression under a generalized linear hurdle model (42) . To generate gene ranks, gene-specific average log fold changes were multiplied by the absolute difference in the proportions of cells expressing the gene (+1e-4 as a lower boundary) and the inverse of the FDRadjusted p-values, which were re-scaled from 1e-7 to 1 to institute reasonable bounds in the ranking.

Bar graphs, and the numbers on them, represent the value of the normalized median COVID-19 cytokine level relative to the normalized median influenza cytokine level for a given cytokine. Bars in light red represent cytokine levels lower in COVID-19 patients relative to influenza patients (normalized median < 1, n = 28) and bars in dark red are cytokines higher in COVID-19 patients relative to influenza patients (normalized median > 1, n = 7). (B) Box plots show cytokine concentrations in COVID-19, influenza, and healthy subjects: Presented p-values are from post hoc Dunn's tests, following adjustment for multiple testing. (C) Forest plots depicting the odds ratios obtained from logistic regression analysis between cytokines and COVID-19 infection (left) and severe disease (i.e., resulting in intubation or death; right). Logistic regression models utilized absolute log10-transformed cytokine values and included age and the number of days since symptom onset at sampling as covariates. Results from each cytokine module are presented, as well as results from each constituent cytokine Modules 1 and 2, which showed the most variation across tested outcomes; otherwise, cytokines are only presented if they reached statistical significance in one of the logistic regression models. Grey shading indicates the area of the plots where odds ratios are less than 1, which are indicative of negative associations. Presented p-values correspond to the specific module or cytokine and were adjusted for multiple testing. Odds ratios are indicated with points, and confidence lines encompass the range between the lower and upper limits. Red points and confidence lines indicate FDR-adjusted p-values < 0.05.

(D) Violin plots demonstrate extreme downregulation of selected interferon-activated (OAS1) or interferon-induced (IFIT3, MX1) genes among cells from COVID-19 patients (red) compared to cells from influenza patients (blue). Asterisks indicate significance at FDR < 0.05. (E) In direct comparison to cells from influenza-infected patients, transcriptional patterns among cells from COVID-19 patients reveal significant upregulation (red bars) of metabolic pathways, stress pathways, and glucocorticoid signaling pathways, particularly in monocytes/macrophages; in contrast, interferon pathways were significantly downregulated (blue bars) among subsets from COVID-19 patients. Grey bars indicate that tests for enrichment did not meet statistical significance for a particular subset. Supplementary Figure 5 .

Asterisks indicate an additional, more stringent Bonferroni multiple testing adjustment, with *** corresponding to FWER (family-wise error rate) < 0.001 and ** corresponding to FWER < 0.01. Odds ratios are presented in a color scales that spans from dark purple (OR = 1/2.5), corresponding to a negative association between cytokine expression and severity, to dark brown (OR = 2.5), corresponding to a positive association between cytokine expression and severity.
