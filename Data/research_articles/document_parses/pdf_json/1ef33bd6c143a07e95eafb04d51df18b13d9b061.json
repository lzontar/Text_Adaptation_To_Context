Because of the long interval between these two time points, it might be reasonable to infer that a small amount of viable virus, yet could not be detected by virus culture, remained present after the 18th day of disease course and last for more days. This implies the contagious period of COVID-19 might last more than one week after \"clinical recovery\". Many of COVID-19 patients in Taiwan also had similar findings (unpublished data). Such prolonged virus shedding was also observed among asymptomatic pediatric patients in fecal specimen. 7 However, this needs more studies to clarify since it would be a major issue in realizing and controlling the COVID-19 epidemics.",

However, SARS-CoV-2 persisted to be detectable till 63th day after symptom onset. Among respiratory specimens from different sites, specimen from sputum showed superior sensitivity to samples from throat swab and gargling wash. Initially, specimen from gargling wash showed considerable results compared with specimens from sputum or throat swab. Nevertheless, RT-PCR examinations from sputum still outweighed samples from gargling and throat swab after fever subsided. Among three target genes of the RT-PCR examinations, E gene of SARS-CoV-2 showed superior sensitivity to N and RdRp gene after clinical symptoms resolved. The stool specimen collected on the third day after symptom onset yielded positive results, but turned negative in the following specimens. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in the plasma samples while the SARS-CoV-2 titers in the respiratory specimen remained high.SARS-CoV-2 could be isolated from cell cultures in throat swab collected upon admission, and all sputum specimens collected within 18 days after symptoms onset.",
