The first epidemic wave has peaked in several countries, including in France a couple of weeks ago, but the infection continues to spread quickly throughout the world, with more than 2,700,000 confirmed cases at the end of April 2020, when this editorial was written [1] . Also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the disease is caused by a novel single-stranded enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic carriers who can transmit the virus to a fatal pleiotropic syndrome. The disease can progress quickly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a high fatality rate, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, in whom mortality rates of 10-15% have been recorded [2] . In addition to the common pulmonary presentation, there are also typical cardiovascular manifestations induced by COVID-19 [3] . Beyond COVID-19 itself, the confinement on a planetary scale is having major consequences for the epidemiology and public health management of cardiovascular diseases, as well as for cardiovascular research.",

Direct cardiac damage has been shown to affect between 7% and 17% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and 59% of patients whose deaths were related to COVID-19 [6] . Myocardial ischaemia has also been described as a potential mechanism of cardiac injury. Indeed, because ACE2 is expressed in the endothelium, it may induce endothelial shedding and dysfunction, leading to vascular damage, local inflammation and the production of procoagulant factors. These mechanisms may underlie the thrombosis and atheroma plaque rupture observed in patients with COVID-19 [7] , similar to the increase in type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) described in association with influenza infection [8] .",

Indeed, many investigators have reported a reduction in patients admitted for ST-segment elevation MI associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [14] . In addition, an increase of up to 60 minutes in the delay from diagnosis to reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary interventions has been reported in regions deeply affected by COVID-19 [15] . For those reasons, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the USA have recommended that hospitals should consider postponing elective angioplasty during the outbreak [16] . At the end of confinement, the increased demand for cardiovascular healthcare services caused by the delay in patient management may lead to an imbalance between the needs and capacities of cardiologists, primary care physicians and hospitals.",

For that reason, the learned societies have proposed guidelines to prioritize patients at highest risk, for whom cardiovascular imaging is likely to substantially change patient management or be lifesaving [18] . As a result, cardiovascular imaging laboratories have cancelled all non-urgent examinations to focus on urgent Page 5 of 7 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 COVID-19-related diseases, such as myocarditis or severe MI resulting from delayed management as a consequence of the pandemic. In addition, some practices have evolved to reduce the risk of COVID-19 dissemination, such as the use of coronary computed tomography angiography to exclude an acute coronary syndrome in COVID-19 pneumonia with elevated troponins, to prevent unnecessary passage into the catheterization laboratory. Finally, whereas the use of cardiac MRI has fallen during the epidemic because of the risk of contamination, the use of computed tomography has increased proportionally, particularly to rule out left atrial appendage thrombus in patients referred for supraventricular arrhythmia ablation, in substitution of transoesophageal echocardiography.",
