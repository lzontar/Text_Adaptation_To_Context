The siltuximab antibody IL-6 complex neutralizes the activity of IL-6 to prevent acute-phase expression of CRP. Therefore, serum CRP levels provide an indirect measure of siltuximab efficacy in neutralizing IL-6 (Bloomfield et al. 2019; EUSA 2019), which is a recognised component of the cytokine storm associated withCOVID-  19 (Mehta P et al. 2020; Xu X et al. 2020). Five days following treatment with siltuximab, serum CRP was reduced to within the normal range in all patients with available data, and levels stabilized through to Day 7 of follow-up suggesting that inflammation levels were reduced in response to treatment. Furthermore, the clinical outcome was improved in seven patients and stabilized in nine patients as evidenced by a decrease in the numbers of patients requiring ventilation. Of note, there were a high number of middle aged and overweight men treated, which may not be representative of a typical population(Guan P et al. 2020).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients infected with SARS-", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Characteristics </td><td>All Patients N=21* </td></tr><tr><td>Gender, N (%) </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Male </td><td>18 (85.71) </td></tr><tr><td>Female </td><td>3 (14.29) </td></tr><tr><td>Age (years) </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Median (range) </td><td>64.0 (48-75) </td></tr><tr><td>Min, Max </td><td>48, 75 </td></tr><tr><td>Height (cm), N=10 </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Median </td><td>178.0 </td></tr><tr><td> Min, Max </td><td>168, 195 </td></tr><tr><td>Weight (kg), N=20 </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Median </td><td>85.0 </td></tr><tr><td> Min, Max </td><td>60, 110 </td></tr><tr><td>Comorbidities, N (%) </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Hypertension </td><td>9 (42.86) </td></tr><tr><td>Diabetes </td><td>5 (23.81) </td></tr><tr><td>Cardiovascular disease </td><td>4 (19.05) </td></tr><tr><td>Malignancies </td><td>1 (4.76) </td></tr><tr><td>Cerebrovascular disease </td><td>1 (4.76) </td></tr><tr><td>Chronic kidney disease </td><td>1 (4.76) </td></tr><tr><td>Signs and symptoms, N (%) Fever </td><td>19 (90.48) </td></tr><tr><td>Dyspnea </td><td>15 (71.43) </td></tr><tr><td>Dry cough </td><td>13 (61.90) </td></tr><tr><td>Diarrhea </td><td>5 (23.81) </td></tr><tr><td>Fatigue </td><td>4 (19.05) </td></tr><tr><td>Myalgia </td><td>3 (14.29) </td></tr><tr><td>Anorexia </td><td>2 (9.52) </td></tr><tr><td>Time from hospitalization to start of treatment (days) </td></tr><tr><td> Median </td><td>3.0 </td></tr><tr><td> Min, Max </td><td>0, 8 </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Laboratory findings of interest in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 on admission to hospital", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>All Patients N= 21 </td></tr><tr><td>IL-6 (pg/mL), N=19 </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Median </td><td>139.5 </td></tr><tr><td>Min, Max </td><td>113, 239 </td></tr><tr><td>C-reactive protein (mg/dL) N=21 </td></tr><tr><td>Median </td><td>23.40 </td></tr><tr><td>Min, Max </td><td>9.5, 43.1 </td></tr><tr><td>PaO2/FiO2 (ratio), N=18 </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Median </td><td>127.0 </td></tr><tr><td>Min, Max </td><td>69.0, 291.0 </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Treatment parametersTreatment within 24 hours vs 48 hours from CPAP/NIV (N, %), N=21", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Clinical outcomes following treatment with siltuximab in patients infected with SAR-CoV-2 experiencing ARDS", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>All Patients </td></tr><tr><td>Clinical Outcome </td><td>N=21 N (%) </td></tr><tr><td>Improvement (released from CPAP/NIV) </td><td>7 (33) </td></tr><tr><td>No clinically relevant change (continuous use of CPAP/NIV) </td><td>9 (43) </td></tr><tr><td>Worsening of condition (intubation or death) </td><td>5 (24) </td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": []}
