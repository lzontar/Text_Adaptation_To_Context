The incubation period for symptomatic development in COVID-19 is approximately 4-7 days. 9 Based on the severity of symptoms, COVID-19 can be classified into three categories. 1, 2, 10 Mild cases are marked by the onset of symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and so forth, with or without mild pneumonia. Severe cases demonstrate dyspnea, acute respiratory stress, decrease in blood oxygen saturation, lung infiltrates, multiple peripheral ground-glass opacities on both lungs, and so forth. Critical cases present symptoms such as respiratory or multiple organ failure and septic shock. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be about 2.3%, with a range from 6 to 41 days from the onset of symptoms to death. 10, 11 COVID-19 patients also develop dyslipidemia which is associated with the disease severity. 12, 13 Many cancer biomarkers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigens (CA) have shown an elevation in various inflammatory conditions in the lungs. [14] [15] [16] We posit that SARS-CoV-2-induced acute lung injuries may be associated with elevations of some cancer biomarkers. In this study, we performed a thorough investigation of the pathological profiles of COVID-19 from a series of laboratory serum tests; these profiles may reflect the progression of the disease.

We had all female subjects in normal control group of HE4, which data had a gender bias. In order to determine whether the gender was a potential factor contributing to the elevation of HE4 in patients, we divided the cohort based on genders in each category. Both female and male patients with mild COVID-19 showed significant higher levels of HE4 as compared with the normal subjects (Fig 1A, p<0.05) ; they also showed gradual increases in HE4 levels in correlation with the disease severity, regardless of genders (Fig 1A, p<0.05 ).",

Our data demonstrate that levels of serum HE4, CYFRA21-1, CEA, CA125, CA153, SCC and NSE are positively associated with CRP, a crucial factor in correlation with the severity of the disease. Our findings provide insights into the detailed pathological evolution of COVID-19 in patients; this will not only aid in understanding the disease's molecular pathology, and facilitate early diagnosis, but will also help in assessing long-term outcomes.",

The requirement for informed consent was waved by the IRB committee. The study was carried out at the Cancer Center, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Wuhan. A total of 252 patients admitted to the hospital from February 13 and March 3, 2020, were included in this study. Electronic data regarding epidemiological, demographic, clinical symptoms and diagnosis, laboratory tests, treatments and outcomes were extracted. All patients were confirmed with an infection of SARS-COV-2 on nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens or induced sputum using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay prior to be admitted into our center for treatments. The primers and probe for real-time RT-PCR were reported previously. 10 Pneumonia was diagnosed according to the guidelines from Chinese Thoracic Society, Chinese Medicine Association and the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) guidelines. Patients were classified into three categories mild (n=131), severe (n=98), and critical (n=23) cases, according to Chinese Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and a previous literature. 1 Patients were discharged if they met all of the following three criteria from the national CDC's guidelines: (1) with normal Accepted Article temperatures for more than three consecutive days; (2) remission of clinical symptoms, including cough, fever and dyspnea; and (3) continuous twice negative RT-PCR results performed in every other day. All patients had an inhospital lung computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to exclude a lung cancer. Patients with a medical history of cancer were also excluded from this study. Normal subjects who had laboratory tests of one or more cancer biomarkers in our hospital between October 1 and Nov 1, 2019 were included. De-identified electronic data including only age, gender and values of specific cancer biomarkers were extracted. Depending on the available data, we totally included the following age and gender-matched normal subjects in each cancer biomarker category: CEA (n=190), CA 125 (n=245), CA153 (n=197), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC, n=64), cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA21-1, n=88), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE, n=78). Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4, n=30) was only tested on female subjects in our hospital as a biomarker for ovarian cancer. The detailed demographic features for normal subjects in each cancer biomarker test category were listed in Supplementary Table 1. 2.2 Clinical laboratory tests All tests were carried out at our certified clinical laboratory under standard procedures and practices that fully complied with regulations and guidelines of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) and CDC.

Other general laboratory tests were listed in Supplementary table 2. WBC, LY and MO counts were performed on Beckman LH750 analyzer using manufacture's reagents (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The general metabolic profiles were tested on Beckman AU5800 chemistry analyzer using manufacture's reagents (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Cytokines and cancer biomarkers were tested on Abbott i2000 using manufacture's chemiluminescent immunoassay reagents (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA).
