            "text": "The genetic similarity observed among species is normally attributed to the existence of a common ancestor. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the exchange of genetic material is not limited to the transfer from parent to offspring but can also occur through horizontal transfer (HT). Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA fragments with an innate propensity for HT; they are mobile and possess parasitic characteristics that allow them to exist and proliferate within host genomes. However, horizontal transposon transfer (HTT) is not easily detected, primarily because the complex TE life cycle can generate phylogenetic patterns similar to those expected for HTT events. The increasingly large number of new genome projects, in all branches of life, has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the TE content and HTT events in these species, although a standardized method of HTT detection is required before trends in the HTT rates can be evaluated in a wide range of eukaryotic taxa and predictions about these events can be made. Thus, we propose a straightforward hypothesis test that can be used by TE specialists and nonspecialists alike to discriminate between HTT events and natural TE life cycle patterns. We also discuss several plausible explanations and predictions for the distribution and frequency of HTT and for the inherent biases of HTT detection. Finally, we discuss some of the methodological concerns for HTT detection that may result in the underestimation and overestimation of HTT rates during eukaryotic genome evolution.",

The arrival of a new TE in a host genome can have detrimental consequences because TE mobility may induce mutation. Moreover, transposition activity increases the TE copy number and generates chromosomal rearrangement hotspots (C\u00e1 ceres et al. 2001; McVean 2010) . However, HTT can also introduce new genetic material into a genome and promote the shuffling of genes and TE domains among hosts, which can be co-opted by the host genome to perform new functions (Pace et al. 2008 ; Thomas et al. 2010) .",

            "text": "One of the most promising methodologies for the detection of HTT is based on a between-species comparison of the neutral rate of evolution (assessed by synonymous substitution divergence) for both the TEs and the HGs. This approach assumes that, if TEs have been vertically transmitted and maintained by neutral evolutionary processes in the genomes of two different species since their last common ancestor, the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) of the TEs should be equal to or greater than that of the vertically transmitted HGs. However, if the dS obtained for the TE is significantly lower than the dS for the vertically transferred HG, the most probable explanation is that these elements were exchanged by HT between the species after their reproductive isolation. This pattern can be observed because a horizontally transferred TE has spent less time in the new host genome than the original HGs. These HGs have been in the genome since the last common ancestor of the species involved in the HT. Therefore, these TEs have had less time to accumulate synonymous substitutions than the HGs. It is noteworthy to state that even if a TE shows a dS value equal to or greater than the HG dS, it does not necessarily imply vertical transmission (VT). This pattern can also be generated by an HTT event occurring just after the split of the involved species. For these comparisons, it is necessary to choose HGs with similar codon usages to those of the TEs (Silva and Kidwell 2000; Ludwig et al. 2008) . If an HG with a higher codon usage bias is chosen, it can present low dS values and results in the underestimation of the number of HTT events (Silva and Kidwell 2000; Vidal et al. 2009 ).",

Differences in the codon usage bias are expected to be higher among genomes from different species than among the genes within the genome of the same species. According to this premise, it should be possible to detect the recent invasion of a genome by TEs from the patterns of codon usage bias because the TE's codon usage should be more homologous to that of the donor species than that of the receptor species. Recently, Rodelsperger and Sommer (2011) showed the utility of this methodology for detecting HTT events between a beetle species and its associated nematode. It is noteworthy that the species-specific codon usage bias becomes less evident when more closely related species are considered because of their phylogenetic similarity (Sharp et al. 1995) . Thus, although this methodology can be very useful in detecting HTT between distantly related species, there are limitations to its application in related species.",

These two tests can be complementary in HTT detection. The codon usage bias comparison can be used to evaluate HTT in distantly related species; however, the difference in the codon usage bias among closely related species is normally low, which does not allow the donor (and TE) and the recipient species codon usages to be distinguished. TE and HG dS comparisons can be used to evaluate HTT in closely related species and in distantly related species alike. If we find that the codon usage bias is similar between the TEs and the host genome and that the TE dS values are equal to or greater compared with the HGs, then it is likely that the TEs are being inherited by vertical transfer (fig. 1B) . Otherwise, if the TE's codon usage bias is different from that of the host genome or if the dS is significantly lower for the TEs than for the nuclear HGs, then the TEs were most likely exchanged among the species by HT ( fig. 1A ).

However, as these constraints are expected to act on specific sites and not on the sequence as a whole, the magnitude of these constraints should be small. Therefore, these factors cannot explain the dS differences observed between HGs and TEs when the TE is conserved across the entire sequence. In fact, sometimes the dS values between TEs from different species are very low, the magnitude of which could not be easily explained by the previously described constraints. Therefore, a very low dS measurement is better explained by the occurrence of an HTT.",

However, HTT events can occur among FIG. 1.-A schematic representation of a hypothesis test for discerning between HT and the natural stages of the TE life cycle. BOX: The first line of evidence for HTT: Phylogenetic incongruence (PI) between the host and TE phylogenies. Patchy distribution (PD) of a given TE within a group of species and high similarity (HS) between the TEs from different species. T1-The first test to distinguish between HTT and vertical transmission (VT)-comparing the dS between the TE and host genes (HGs) and species-specific codon usage bias (CUB). H0-vertical transfer is more probable if the dS values for the TEs are greater than or equal to the dS values of the vertically transmitted host genes and if the TE codon usage bias is similar to the codon usage bias in the host species. H1-HT will be selected if the TE's dS value is significantly lower than the dS values of the vertically transmitted host genes or if the TE codon usage bias is different from the host species codon usage bias. T2-A second step can be used to evaluate HTT between closely related species. H0-If there is synteny beyond the border of the TE copies, it is more probable that these copies were shared by hybridization among the host species (an introgression [INT] occurred). H1-If there is no synteny, it is more probable that these copies were shared by an HTT event between host species. individuals encompassing any taxonomic level, from different phyla to closely related species (Bartolom\u00e9 et al. 2009 ). It is very difficult to prove HTT among closely related species, and in this case, the sharing of TEs between species can be the result of the occasional cross-fertilization between species. Introgression events between closely related species can generate significantly lower dS values for the TEs compared with the nonintrogressed HGs. The analysis of synteny beyond the border of the TE copies, that is, analysis all the TE copies present in one species, and an evaluation of whether they are found at the same locus in another species is one method that has been suggested to discern between introgression and HTT (Fortune et al. 2008 ) (T2 in fig. 1 ). Introgression events normally maintain synteny among the species involved in the hybridization; in other words, homology and high identity are encountered not only in the TE sequences but also in the neighboring DNA regions ( fig. 1D ). However, when HTT events occur, only variability with the absence of synteny is typically encountered in the TE-neighboring regions (Fortune et al. 2008) (fig. 1C ). Nevertheless, despite the fact that this methodology is consistent and straightforward, it has yet to be tested, and it could proved to be particularly difficult to evaluate the synteny of TEs because of their inherent mobility. It is likely that this methodology will be restricted to the analysis of nonautonomous TEs, but even nonautonomous elements can be mobilized by other TEs in trans, a factor that would complicate the analysis. Regardless, if synteny is found, it is taken as evidence that hybridization occurred; therefore, in the absence of synteny, the probability that the sharing of TEs between species as the result of hybridization decreases, whereas the probability of an HTT event increases.",

Domestication can be detected using features such as copy number, orthologous position, and evaluating the selective constraint (dN:dS ratio) acting between the TEs that are incongruent with the host species' phylogeny and comparing this constraint with the selective constraint on the HGs. Thereby, we can discern whether the HS found between the TEs from different host species is due to domestication events, different evolutionary rates, or ancestral polymorphism. Other analyses can also reveal clues as to whether a TE is domesticated, such as the presence of only one TE copy in the genome or the observation that the TEs occur at orthologous positions in different species (Sinzelle et al. 2009 ). Another approach that can be used to gather clues about TE domestication is the analysis of full-length TE copies (including inverted terminal repeats, long terminal repeats, and coding and noncoding regions). If there are high similarities along all the TE sequences, the best explanation for the sequence conservation is the occurrence of an HTT event. This is because TE domestication only imposes strong selective constraints on one region of a TE and not in the full-length copies (Feschotte 2008; Sinzelle et al. 2009 ). Even if a domestication occurred, a dS TE smaller than dS HG is unlikely to be observed, because negative selection acts only in nonsynonymous substitutions and not over neutral synonymous substitutions. Therefore, we also can evaluate if occurred HT events before the domestication event using the dS analysis (T1 in fig. 1 ).",

One way to perform this analysis is by evaluating the molecular evolution rate of the nuclear genes with a codon usage bias similar to the TE to estimate the time of divergence between horizontally transferred TEs copies (Ludwig et al. 2008) . A second type of analysis can be performed when the entire host genome is available. In this case, an ancestral sequence can be inferred when evaluating many copies of one horizontally transferred element. This analysis is based on the premise that these elements have been evolving neutrally since the HT event; therefore, we can estimate the time of the first insertion event and the subsequent amplification inside of the host genome using a neutral substitution rate (Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium 2002; Yang et al. 2004; Khan et al. 2006; Pace and Feschotte 2007) . This neutral substitution rate can be estimated from an ancestral TE present in an orthologous position (inherited vertically) in genomes where we have an estimate of the host species' divergence time (Pace et al. 2008) . Therefore, with these type of data, we can evaluate whether a TE is more recent than expected for vertical transfer, and by comparing this activity estimative among different species, we also can reveal relationships between the donor and the receptor species.",

The differences in the HTT frequencies among kingdoms may be explained by differential susceptibilities of taxas to experiencing HTT. However, these differences could also be due to a historical bias for the use of animal model organisms in TE research or the differential abilities of the studied TEs to undergo HT (Pritham 2009; Schaack et al. 2010) . To date, 178 of the 330 HTT cases described in the literature were detected among Drosophila species (54%). This disproportionate number of HTTs in Drosophila could be biased because some of the pioneering studies in TEs, including the first well-documented case of HTT (Daniels et al. 1984) , were performed in these model organisms. Thus, these studies opened the door for TE research using the Drosophila genus. Several recent publications have shown evidence of HTT events in other Animalia taxa, such as crustaceans and mammals (Casse et al. 2006; Gilbert et al. 2010; Novick et al. 2010) , further suggesting that the elevated number of HTT events described in Drosophila may show a historical bias.",

Moreover, fungi present a low, and most likely poorly studied, TE content (1,603 TEs in Repbase) compared with animals (12,565) or plants (4,638) ( fig. 2A ). It is important to note that the existence of only a few described HTT events in fungi does not mean that HTT does not occur; it more likely indicates that HTT occurs but cannot be detected due to the high turnover of TEs in species with large N e values and small genomes. However, this is not always the case. D. melanogaster, for example, has a small N e compared with most fungi species but has a high turnover for retrotransposons and a high rate of HTT (Lerat et al. 2003) .",

This evolutionary link suggests that some LTR retrotransposons can undergo HTT by themselves if they are capable of producing viral capsids and envelopes (env gene), hence promoting a viral-like infection and thereby eliminating the requirement for a vector. It has been shown that gypsy elements are capable of producing viral capsids and infecting gypsy-free D. melanogaster strains (Kim et al. 1994; Song et al. 1994) . Even LTR retrotransposons that lack the env gene and the gene responsible for producing viral capsids can use the viral capsids from other LTR retrotransposons in trans, allowing a \"helped\" infection (Coffin et al. 1997) . Recently, Routh et al. (2012) showed that at least 5.3% of the RNAs packaged inside of viral-like particles contain sequences derived from TEs, including DNA transposons, LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons. However, the capacity of gypsy viral capsids to infect other Drosophila species still remains unclear and requires further elucidation. The same holds true for the in trans infection hypothesis.",

This assumption is based on the premise that a retrotransposon's recognition machinery is analogous to that of a virus, which recognizes a restricted set of cellular receptors from a particular group of species. Furthermore, this analogy allows the extrapolation that HTT events should occur in waves, similar to those in a viral infection. When we look at all the previously described examples of HTT involving LTR retrotransposons, we note that 88.88% (104 of 117) of the events are among species from the same genus, 3.41% (4 of 117) occur among species from different genera, 6.83% (8 of 117) occur among species from different orders, and only one event was observed among species from different phyla. However, the tendency for a higher frequency of LTR retrotransposon HTT events among closely related species could represent a strong taxonomic bias because 74 of the 86 described HTT events involving retrotransposons were described in the Drosophila. Regarding the HTT waves, one study reported that retrotransposon HTT waves occurred among Drosophila species (de Setta et al. 2009 ). Because of this, future studies are required to evaluate whether the LTR retrotransposon HTT events also occur more frequently among closely related species in other taxa.",

This structural simplicity can increase the likelihood of stable vector transportation during an HT event and is thought to represent an adaptation for HTTs . O'Brochta et al. (2009) observed that hobo/Hermes hAT elements commonly produce stable and recombinogenic episomes; the circular extrachromosomal DNA of these transposons is a stable excision product that can reintegrate at a new site. Therefore, it is possible that these episomes could maintain TE recombinogenic properties following the transport by a vector into another species.",

Based on the common features shared between some TEs and viruses, one would assume that if the infective capacity is an important step in the HTT of LTR retrotransposons, then jumps by viral species between host species are expected to be common. In fact, there are many works reporting the jumping of viral species between host species. These events are commonly called viral-host switches (Gibbs and Weiller 1999; Nemirov et al. 2002; Vijaykrishna et al. 2007; Kang et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2010 Liu et al. , 2011 Longdon et al. 2011) or species jumps. Viral-host switches have been primarily described in vertebrate species, the majority of which are related to human infectious diseases such as HIV, SARS, and H5N1 (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Parrish et al. 2008) . Thus far, little importance has been given to these events in other taxa; however, some examples of viral species jumps have recently been described in Drosophila species (Liu et al. 2010) . Altogether, these viral and TE data suggest that the infective capacity of some TEs is likely a key step that allows their horizontal transmission across species.",

Under excessive transposase production, mariner transposases aggregate together, causing a decrease in the transposition rate Lohe et al. 1997) . When an organism acquires a new active transposon by HTT, a burst of transposition events typically follows, until all copies are mutationally inactivated or regulated by the inner host regulation mechanisms (Boer et al. 2007 ). High TE activity may cause detrimental changes in the host genome with TE insertions in coding or regulatory gene sequences. Self-regulatory mechanisms can be advantageous to TEs because these mechanisms can decrease the probability that a detrimental mutation will be introduced into the host genome, thereby increasing the TE's odds for inheritance by the host's descendants. Thus, TEs with self-regulatory mechanisms appear to have evolved a more effective strategy for an efficient invasion and for being maintained in host descendants reducing their harmful effects for the new host's genome.",

Therefore, the TEs must be transmitted to the reproductive cells to be inherited by the descendants of a new host, that is, to gain entry into a new host genome via HTT. Thus, we might expect that HTTs should be more prevalent in unicellular eukaryotes and multicellular eukaryotes with undifferentiated reproductive and somatic cells because any cell in the body that has acquired a new TE can transmit it to future generations. Along these lines, Pritham (2009) suggested that unicellular eukaryotes should be particularly susceptible to HT due to the lack of a protected germline. Supporting these ideas, Robertson (1997) identified seven putative HTT events between insects and Hydra and one HTT case between the planarian Dugesia tigrina and the ant Crematogaster cerasi. In line with these findings, Chapman et al. (2010) more recently identified at least 90 potential HTT events in the Hydra magnipapillata genome. Hydras and planarians are animals without germ and somatic cell differentiation. Nevertheless, despite the difficulty imposed by cellular segregation, almost all HTT cases have been described in multicellular eukaryotes that have reproductive and somatic cell differentiation.",

For example, successful TE invasions by HT are less likely in species with a higher N e m and shorter generation times because there is an increased probability of the TE being inactivated. The influence of the N e is a result of the balance between natural selection and genetic drift (Lynch and Conery 2003) . The genomes of host species with large population sizes, as many unicellular organisms possess, are also subject to a strong purifying selection (Lynch 2007) . Thus, if an HTT event occurs in these species, the probability that the TEs will be quickly eliminated by natural selection is high. On the other hand, in species with small population sizes, such as many tetrapods, genetic drift increases the probability that a new TE will be maintained in the host genome following an HTT event. Lynch and Coney (2003) reported that host species should have an N e less than approximately equal to 7 \u00c2 10 7 to allow retrotransposon proliferation and an N e less than approximately equal to 2 \u00c2 10 7 to allow the proliferation of DNA transposons.",

The inability to detect HTT results from the high turnover of TEs in host genomes (Lerat et al. 2003) . When a TE arrives in a new genome, it usually occurs through a transposition burst that can be detrimental to the new host. The individuals bearing these detrimental changes can then be eliminated by natural selection, hence abolishing the signal of the primary invasion. When TEs successfully invade and are maintained in a new genome, the TE copies will evolve under neutral or weak natural selection (Silva and Kidwell 2000) . Both low-dS measures obtained from the TEs compared with the HGs and species-specific codon usage biases from donor species tend to degenerate over the course of time. Thus, the more ancient an HTT event, the more difficult it will be to detect ( fig. 3A ). This promotes a weak signal of HTT events, leading to underestimation ( fig. 3B) .",

The maximum number of overestimated HTT events will be the number of analyzed species derived from the donor clade since the last common ancestor, multiplied by the number of analyzed species derived from the receptor clade since the HTT event.",

In this situation, overestimation will occur if we count each pairwise comparison resulting in a dS TE < dS HG as one event, as mentioned earlier. However, in the scenario depicted in figure 3D , for example, if we consider the observed cases as a unique, ancient HTT events, we will obtain an underestimate because three independent HTT events have occurred. In some specific cases, however, dS values can be used to date these HTT events ( fig. 3E ). For example, HTT events may be dated when the time since the occurrence of the HTT is long enough to result in differentiated in dS values, when the studied species have a well-resolved phylogeny and when a calibrated molecular clock is available. The number of dates obtained in these analyses may then be used to parsimoniously estimate the number of HTT cases.",
