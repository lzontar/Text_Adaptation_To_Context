Most medical staff complained that the sweating started 30 minutes after wearing PPE: the longer the wearing time, the more the sweaty. Moreover, the level 3 PPE provided an airtight system, sweat, and water vapours from the respiratory tract were difficult to volatilise, which resulted in moisture gathering on the skin, soaked the skin for long periods, made the stratum corneum softer and thinner, and thus more susceptible to mechanical forces and increased risk of DRPI. 14 The increased risk of DRPI in male (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.12-1.99, P = .006) may be related to activity levels, hormonal differences, or a perception that Chinese men do not pay attention to use skin care products to maintain their skin health as women do.

Suggestions made in this study included, firstly, it is required to evaluate the suitable daily wearing time and to limit the daily wearing time of PPE to 4 hours or less as far as possible. 7, 15 Secondly, it is necessary to evaluate the feasibility and effect of preventive dressings under PPE in line with guideline recommendations. 7, [15] [16] [17] [18] Because in the early days of wearing PPE, the use of prophylactic dressings to prevent DRPI on the face is controversial. Some people thought that the use of preventive dressing might affect the airtightness of N95 respirators and goggles and affect the protective effect. Then some people in practice found that the use of hydrocolloid dressing or silicone foam dressing on the nose, cheeks, and forehead did not affect the protective effect, but it could effectively prevent DRPI on the face ( Figure 8 ).Therefore, this problem deserves further study. Thirdly, medical staff wearing PPE need to check their skin at least twice a day, 7,15-18 and optimise the skin condition by using products to protect from moistureassociated skin damage (MASD). 19, 20 F I G U R E 8 Practice of protecting skin with preventive dressings when wearing PPE: A, protect the bridge of nose, cheeks and forehead with ultra-thin foam dressings before wearing PPE; B, wear N95 respirator and goggles; C, slight indentations on cheeks after wearing N95 respirator and goggles for 6 hours with preventive dressings; D, obvious indentations on cheeks and forehead after wearing N95 respirator and goggles for 6 hours without preventive dressings.
