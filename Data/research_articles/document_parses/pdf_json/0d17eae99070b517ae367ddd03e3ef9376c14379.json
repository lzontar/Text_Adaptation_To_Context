Nanoparticles can be classified as particles of a size no greater than 100 nm, and their unique attributes to combat infection have received considerable attention. Nanomaterials are increasingly finding uses in products such as antimicrobial surface coatings and semiconductors. Such nanoparticulate materials include spherical, cubic and needle-like nanoscaled particles (approximately 5-100 nm) and near-nanoscaled devices (up to micrometers) (Cushing et al. 2004 ). The properties of nanoparticles, for example hardness, active surface area, chemical reactivity and biological activity, can be dramatically different from those of micrometer-sized particles (Allaker and Ren 2008) , and indeed the biocidal effectiveness of metallic nanoparticles has been suggested to be due to both their size and their high surface-to-volume ratio. Such characteristics should allow them to closely interact with microbial membranes, the effect not being solely due to the release of metal ions .

Within this context, a biofilm can be classed as an aggregate of microorganisms in which cells adhere to each other and to a surface (Marsh and Martin 2009 ).

As a result, the composition of the microbial flora of the mouth varies considerably from site to site and at different times. The composition of the oral microflora, in addition to being variable, is highly complex. Up to 1,000 different species of bacteria at 10 8 -10 9 bacteria per mL saliva or mg dental plaque are known to be associated with the oral cavity, and it has been suggested that only 50% of the bacteria found at this site can be cultured (Marsh and Martin 2009) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 850, "end": 873, "text": "(Marsh and Martin 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In the majority of cases, infections of the oral cavity are bacterial, fungal or viral.

Oral infections may arise either from an endogenous source, i.e. one yielding microorganisms normally found in the mouth, such as plaque-related dental caries ('tooth decay') and periodontal disease ('gum disease'), or an exogenous source yielding micro-organisms not normally found as part of the oral microflora. Dental caries and periodontal disease involve the adherence of bacteria and development of biofilms on both the natural and restored tooth surface.

The acquired pellicle also contains several antibacterial components such as secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) and lysozyme, and provides both barrier and buffering functions (Hannig and Joiner 2006) . Both de-and remineralisation processes of the teeth are also mediated by the pellicle. In terms of bacterial colonisation, many of the proteins that make up the pellicle act as receptors for the specific interaction with adhesins on the surface of pioneer bacterial species (Hannig and Joiner 2006) .

This is of particular importance within the oral cavity when these agents have to reach fewer accessible stagnation sites or through plaque to the enamel. Thus, there remains an interest in the development of plaque control measures that require a minimum of public compliance and professional health care intervention (Wilson 1996) . Within this context, antimicrobial nanoparticles may be of particular value if retained at approximal teeth surfaces and below the gum margin. The anti-caries potential of fluoride and other more conventional antimicrobial/antiplaque agents, which are mostly deployed in mouthwashes and toothpastes, have been well characterised (Baehni and Takeuchi 2003) . However, the potential of nanoparticles as constituents of topical agents to control oral biofilms through either their biocidal or anti-adhesive capabilities is now emerging as an area worthy of serious consideration. The studies by Robinson and co-workers using the 'Leeds in situ model', a device that allows dental plaque to develop in situ on a removable human enamel surface, have helped in the assessment of novel antimicrobial agents and take into account the very complex microbial composition and architecture of plaque biofilms (Watson et al. 2005) . The use of such intact biofilms on natural tooth surfaces would be of particular value to a study of the penetration of nanoparticles and released ions in situ. This model has indicated that plaque contains voids and channels, sometimes extending completely through the biomass to the underlying enamel (Wood et al. 2000) . The presence of channels may have considerable influence on the transfer of nanoparticles through biofilms. The main considerations are the physico-chemical characteristics of the particular nanoparticles used, including the surface charge and degree of hydrophobicity, the surface area-to-mass ratio of the plaque biofilm and the ability of the particles to adsorb to/be taken up at the biofilm surface. Within this context, nanoparticles are potentially useful because it is possible to alter their surface charge, hydrophobicity, and other physical and chemical characteristics (Nel et al. 2009). 14.3 Nanometals and the Control of Oral Infections", "cite_spans": [{"start": 145, "end": 159, "text": "(Stewart 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 481, "end": 494, "text": "(Wilson 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 826, "end": 852, "text": "(Baehni and Takeuchi 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1414, "text": "(Watson et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1720, "end": 1738, "text": "(Wood et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 2322, "end": 2340, "text": "(Nel et al. 2009).", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Control of Oral Biofilms"}, {"text": "Metals have been used for centuries as antimicrobial agents.

The mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of silver is not completely understood, but is likely to involve multiple targets in comparison to the more defined targets of antibiotics. Studies have shown that the positive charge on the Ag+ ion is critical for antimicrobial activity, allowing the electrostatic attraction between the negative charge of the bacterial cell membrane and positively charged nanoparticles (Kim et al. 2007 ). In terms of the molecular mechanisms of inhibitory action of Ag+ ions on microorganisms, it has been shown that DNA loses its ability to replicate (Feng et al. 2000) , and the expression of ribosomal subunit proteins and other cellular proteins and enzymes necessary for ATP production becomes inactivated (Yamanaka et al. 2005) . It has also been hypothesised that Ag+ ions affect membrane-bound respiratory enzymes (Bragg and Rainnie 1974) . However, the precise mechanism(s) of biocidal activity of silver nanoparticles against bacteria remains to be fully elucidated. The work of Sondi and Salopek-Sondi (2004) demonstrated structural changes and damage to bacterial membranes resulting in cell death. These particular studies suggest that sulphur-containing proteins in the membrane or inside the cells and phosphorus-containing elements, such as DNA, are likely to be the preferential binding sites for silver nanoparticles. The contribution of Ag+ ion release from nanoparticles to the overall antimicrobial activity remains unclear. It is suggested that a bacterial cell in contact with silver nanoparticles will take up Ag+ ions, which possibly in turn will inhibit respiratory enzymes and so help to generate free radicals, and subsequent free radical-induced damage to the cell membrane. In order to determine the relationship between free radical formation and antimicrobial activity, the use of antioxidants does suggest that free radicals may be derived from the surface of silver nanoparticles (Kim et al. 2007 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 590, "end": 606, "text": "(Kim et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 757, "end": 775, "text": "(Feng et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 916, "end": 938, "text": "(Yamanaka et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1051, "text": "(Bragg and Rainnie 1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1224, "text": "Sondi and Salopek-Sondi (2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 2119, "end": 2135, "text": "(Kim et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Silver (Ag)"}, {"text": "Alongside silver, copper is a traditionally well-known antimicrobial material.

Released copper ions within the cell may then disrupt nucleic acid and key enzymes (Stohs and Bagchi 1995) .

The high aspect ratio and/or the high surface area-to-volume ratio of nanoparticulates provide such superior properties.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 784, "end": 797, "text": "(Manias 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Properties of Polymer Matrix Nanocomposites"}, {"text": "Silver nanoparticles have been investigated with a view to improving both the physical and the antimicrobial properties of dental polymeric materials, for example, in denture materials (Fig. 14.2) (Monteiro et al. 2009 ) and orthodontic adhesives (Ahn et al. 2009 ).

An approach involving the impregnation of silicone (as used in a wide variety of devices) with nanoparticulate silver, using supercritical carbon dioxide, has been investigated (Furno et al. 2004 ). This may be particularly applicable as regards implantable devices, as their use is a major risk factor for hospital-acquired infection. The initiation of infection involving biomaterials requires an initial adhesion event to the device or more often to the patient-derived glycoprotein coating (conditioning film) which is deposited from the time of implantation (Green et al. 1999) . Following adhesion, microbial proliferation leads to the development of a biofilm which is more resistant to the effect of antimicrobials. Although approaches to prevent this type of infection, including the use of coatings with nanoparticulate silver, have been proposed, unsatisfactory clinical results and on occasion further complications, have occurred (Riley et al. 2002) . Possible reasons for the lack of activity include the inactivation of the antimicrobial coating by plasma components and a lack of inherent durability of the coatings used. Impregnation of polymers may well be more beneficial than the use of coatings or addition into the mix. A significant level of surface-or near-surface-deposited silver nanoparticles should provide an initial \"burst\" effect. However, Furno et al. (2004) showed that the majority of the antimicrobial activity, against both biofilms and planktonic cells, was simply removed by washing the polymer discs impregnated with silver nanoparticles. Further sustained release with significant antimicrobial activity would need to be carefully evaluated. The protection of both inner and outer surfaces against bacterial colonisation by impregnation of an antimicrobial agent is advantageous (Wilcox et al. 1988 ) and has been demonstrated in the clinical setting (Darouiche et al. 1999) .

It is suggested that in such an experimental situation a bacterial growth medium facilitates the release of metallic ions, possibly as a consequence of a reaction with the nutrient media constituents. A greater release of copper ions into a liquid medium could well be due to the presence of an oxide layer on the copper nanoparticles and reaction with chloride ions in the medium. The copper-fluoropolymer (Cu-CFx) nano-composite films in this study were deposited by dual ion-beam sputtering, a technique to deposit different polymeric and inorganic materials in a very controlled manner. Analysis of the layers revealed that the inorganic Cu(II) nanoparticles were evenly dispersed in the branched fluoropolymer matrix. Through the use of electrochemical atomic absorption spectroscopy, copper release kinetics in solutions was measured. A correlation was shown between the chemical composition (copper loading) of the material surface, the concentration of copper ions released into the microbial culture broths, and the bioactivity of the Cu-CFx coating. The Cu-CFx layers, used as coatings, were shown to inhibit the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the bacterial species E. coli, S. aureus and Listeria spp. Such use of Cu-CFx coatings, which allow variable metal loading, demonstrate good stability upon storage and microbial inhibitory activity, is being explored in a variety of applied fields, including food chemistry and biomedicine.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 231, "end": 252, "text": "Cioffi et al.

This approach is now being utilised within the clinical setting in some countries. The killing of microorganisms with light depends upon cytotoxic singlet oxygen and free radical generation by the excitation of a photo-activatable agent or sensitiser. The result of excitation is that the sensitiser moves from an electronic ground state to a triplet state that then interacts with microbial components to generate cytotoxic species (MacRobert et al. 1989 ). One of the advantages of light-activated killing is that resistance to the action of singlet oxygen is unlikely to become widespread in comparison to that experienced with more traditional chemical antimicrobial agents. A sensitiser ideally should absorb light at red to near-infrared wavelengths because these wavelengths are able to penetrate more. The most commonly tested sensitisers on bacteria have been tricyclic dyes (for example methylene blue, erythrosine), tetrapyrroles (for example porphyrins) and furocoumarins (for example psoralen). The use of nanoparticles within this area is now under investigation. For example, a complex of biodegradable and biocompatible poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and colloidal gold nanoparticles, loaded with methylene blue and exposed to red light at 665 nm, have been tested against planktonic E. faecalis and in experimentally infected root canals (Pagonis et al. 2010) .

The photosensitiser erythrosine has an advantage over some other dyes because it is currently used in dentistry to visualise dental plaque in vivo, and so its lack of toxicity in the host is well established. For use in periodontitis, the dye needs to be applied subgingivally prior to fiber-optic laser light activation. However, when disease is present, the periodontal site has a marked flow of gingival crevicular fluid into the pocket, and most photosensitisers lose some activity in the presence of extraneous protein. Also, some have virtually no effect in the presence of saliva and other body fluids.

Nanomaterials can enter the blood stream following inhalation or ingestion, and some can even penetrate the skin. In vitro studies with lung epithelial cells, enterocytes and skin keratinocytes indicate marked differences in susceptibility to metallic nanoparticles according to cell type tested (R.P.

The interface comprises three interacting components: (1) the surface of the nanoparticle, (2) the solid-liquid interface and the effects of the surrounding medium and (3) the contact zone with biological substrates (Fig. 14.3 ; Table 14 .1). The nanoparticle characteristics of most importance as regards interaction with biological systems, whether mammalian or microbial, are chemical composition, surface function, shape and number of sides, porosity and surface crystallinity, heterogeneity, roughness, and hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity (Nel et al. 2006) . For example, it has been shown that titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Luo et al. 2005) act to resist the formation of surface biofilms through increased hydrophilicity in comparison to an unmodified surface. Table 14 .1 for details (With permission; Nel et al. 2009) The characteristics of the surface layer, such as zeta potential (surface charge), nanoparticle aggregation, dispersion state, stability and hydration as influenced by the characteristics of the surrounding medium (including ionic strength, pH, temperature and presence of organic molecules or detergents) are of critical importance. The contribution of surface charge to both mammalian and microbial interactions has been clearly illustrated using surfactant-coated nanoparticles (McCarron et al. 2007 ). Both anti-adherent and antifungal effects were shown using buccal epithelial cells treated with non-drug-loaded poly (ethylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were prepared using emulsion polymerisation and stabilised with cationic, anionic or non-ionic surfactants.

Production of nanoparticles with an anionic surfactant gave lower yields and wide particle size distributions. No evidence of killing against C. albicans was shown. Non-ionic surfactant-coated nanoparticles produced intermediate kill rates. These studies clearly demonstrate the importance of surface charge on the nanoparticle surface.

Cationic particles or particles with a high surface reactivity are more likely to be toxic (both to eukaryotes and prokaryotes). Larger, more hydrophobic or poorly dispersed particles, which are rapidly removed by the reticuloendothelial system, were shown to be less toxic. Karlsson et al. (2008) have recently shown that metal oxide nanoparticles are more toxic than at first envisaged at concentrations down to 40 mg mL \u00c01 and show a high variation as regards different nanoparticle species to cause cytotoxicity, DNA damage and oxidative DNA lesions. Toxic effects on cultured cells were assessed using trypan blue staining together with the comet assay to measure DNA damage and an oxidation-sensitive fluoroprobe to quantify the production of reactive oxygen species (Karlsson et al. 2008) . Copper oxide was found to be the most toxic and therefore may pose the greatest health risk. Nanoparticulate ZnO and TiO 2 , both ingredients in sunscreens and cosmetics, showed cytotoxic and DNA-damaging effects. The potential mechanisms of toxicity for selected nanoparticles are listed in Table 14 .2. In order to help prevent aggregation of nanoparticles, stabilising (capping) agents that bind to the entire nanoparticle surface can be used; these include water-soluble polymers, oligo-and poly-saccharides, sodium dodecyl sulfate, polyethylene glycol and glycolipids.

Again, gram negative bacteria were more affected than gram positive, which suggests that a membrane damage mechanism of action rather than one involving the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is of overriding significance. Polyethylene glycol-capped nanoparticles were highly toxic to human cells with a very low concentration (100 mM) threshold for cytotoxic action, whereas the concentration for antibacterial activity was 50 times greater (5 mM).
