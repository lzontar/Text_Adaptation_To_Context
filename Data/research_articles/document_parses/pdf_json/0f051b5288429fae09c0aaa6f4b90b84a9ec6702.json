The model can readily be applied to other countries by inputting data from public data bases. We also compare our forecasts to the University of Washington (UW) IHME model and are reassuringly similar yet show less variability on a weekly basis. The sum of squares for error (SSE) for international and U.S. states, respectively, that we track are: 34% and 33% for our model vs. 49% and 59% for the IHME model. Conclusions: Our model appears closest to the UW IHME model; however, there are important differences and while both models forecast many of the same results of interest, each one offers unique benefits that the other does not. We believe that the model reported here excels for its simplicity, which makes the model easy to use.",

These values are generally greatly understated since they are confirmed by testing that is never in sufficient supply. So, reports of new cases are really reports of new tests of old cases. This model also can set criteria for which some degree of easing of social restrictions can occur on a gradual basis along with check-gate measurements for when these restrictions can be progressively eased. The model can also forecast the consequences of socially easing prematurely. The motivation for this work is to provide predictive tools that are reasonable and devoid of excessive complications that hinder some other models leading to potential inaccuracies and instabilities in the outcome results.",

            "text": "The traditional approach to modeling is epidemiological in nature and seeks to understand known behavior, which for an epidemic, would be after the fact. Conventional epidemiological models include SIR, SEIR and SEIRS (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, susceptible) models 1,2 and are characterized as being mathematically complex and having many variables that are difficult to define. 3, 4 They are also not well suited to real-time forecasting as new epidemics have their own distinct properties and further it is difficult for them to consider implementation of social restrictions or changes in social behavior due to government easing and/or public rebellion due to economic and social pressures. Our focus here is on a very different approach that uses real-time data to dynamically and statistically forecast important variables of an epidemic as they develop thereby automatically incorporating the epidemic properties and social response as they are embedded in the real-time data. 5 We do note the development of hybrid epidemiological models for COVID-19 that try to incorporate real-time data, but they still appear to be dependent on many difficult-to-define variables and are very complex. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 We also note epidemiological models that have used China COVID-19 data to extrapolate forecasts for the rest of the world. 11 Several real-time statistical models have emerged that specifically address the unique properties and behavior of COVID-19, knowledge that is only learned by following daily trends. 12, 13, 14, 15 Most of these models are being reported, reviewed and critiqued in the public (digital) forum, justifiably prior to being peer reviewed and published. The rationale for this approach is to provide useful information to help inform policy makers and public implementers on immediate responses that need to be taken, e.g., in deciding when it is prudent to ease social restrictions as they weigh against other considerations, such as the health of the economy. That real-time statistical models often update their forecasts is a strength, not a weakness as long as it is within reason; the adjustments reflect the latest reality, which should not be ignored.",

For the symmetric Gaussian in Figure 1 , the DT is equal to 35.1 times the peak death rate (in daily units). For the two-sided asymmetric Gaussian in Figure 4a , where the ascending and descending behaviors are described by \u03c3 and 2\u03c3, respectively, the DT is equal to 52.6 times the peak death rate. In Figure 4b various functions are plotted for various values of \u03c3i and s and the final death count DT is given. As the descending part of the curve becomes more extended the integral value DT becomes greater. This has strong implications for populations to continue to practice social isolation to expedite the descent as long as is reasonable weighed against social and economic pressures. We note that Eq. (7) is just one functional form for \u03c3(t) and others may be proposed, which could be utilized to model behavioral changes in the population during the epidemic due to social distancing and other factors. We propose some interesting avenues of development in the Discussion section, but don't develop this term any further here. It should be noticed though that this linearized (and continuously increasing) function \u03c3(t) has the effect of flattening the entrance wing and extending the exit tail of the total curve. While this is less representative of the death rate growth shape, it has minor impact on the integrated death count; however, the elongated and non-converging tail can have large integrated value, which we do not yet have evidence is a good representation. We discuss in the Discussion other functional forms that can represent reported statistic data as well as anticipated social behavior.",

We have developed a protocol to forecast dates for which gradual and measured easing of social restrictions may begin. The easing date is based on the date for which the prevalence per million people drops to 200 or 2 active case per 10,000 people (0.02%). This is a somewhat arbitrary threshold, but seems reasonable based on that approximate value on the front-end was enough to start exponential outbreaks. So, assuming prevalence continues to drop and we don't revert back to full normal social interactions we should be able to ease while maintaining and even reducing the prevalence. By maintaining the prevalence and assuming a mortality rate of 1% corresponds to one death per million over the course of an infection (about 18 days) and for the U.S. with a population of 331M, would compute to about 18 deaths/day. If we can define a tolerable death rate (perhaps greater than this), then we can back out a different prevalence threshold for social easing. The flatten-the-curve approach is to maintain a death rate sufficiently low to not overload the healthcare system and wait until a vaccine or herd immunity reduces the death rate. However, society may not have the heart to deliberately sustain this level of deaths. This is all weighed against the need to feed economic activity. So ultimately the acceptable death rate comes down to the decision of how many jobs is a death worth. That is a topic outside the scope of this manuscript.",

The former approach is too rigid to be a forecasting tool, but essential for understanding the properties of an epidemic once all the facts are known. Real-time statistical forecasting models are an invention of their times as each pandemic, rare in themselves, are different and therefore a model has to react to these differences. For COVID-19 the most widely cited and utilized model is from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington (UW) 12 and therefore we consider it a worthy benchmark for our model. We have been reporting our forecasts relative to the IHME forecasts on a weekly basis. 5 Figure 6 . Plots of total death forecasts by the IHME and Syage models for hotbed countries. Figure 6 shows the total death forecasts for hotbed international countries by the two models and shows that there is more similarity than differences. (Results for U.S. states are given in Figure S -2 in Supplemental Material.) Still there are differences and that underlines the need to endorse multiple models, even if similar, to provide a range of outcomes representing different, even if subtle, algorithms and assumptions. A true comparison awaits the end of this wave of the pandemic or picking a target date as IHME has for August 4, 2020. Our forecasts extrapolate to the end of the Gaussian tail, but there is very little integration value beyond August 4, 2020 so our comparison is suitable. At this present time, one figure of merit for the stability of a model is how much variation or volatility it has from one time point to the next. In Figure 7 we plot the sum of squares for error (SSE) measure of variability for the weekly forecasts presented in Figure 6 . We caution that variability is necessary because it responds to real-time changes and results, but if excessive can also be detrimental for policy and planning purposes. ",

However, the bi-exponential growth phase does not show an exponential rise or an inflection point as it progresses to a peak rate, but rather has a progressively decreasing rate from inception so we dismiss this functional form.

M will also obviously vary depending on the demographics of the populations (e.g., age distribution, healthcare system) and even change for a particular population due to changing dynamics such as crossing the threshold for overwhelming the healthcare system both on the way and down the epidemic curve. We have made adjustments to our M value, particularly for Spain and Italy varying it between 2.0 to 1.5%.

However, the model described here, up to this point in time (March 12, 2020), displays less forecast variability and may even be a little ahead of trends when compared to the UW IHME model. There does not appear to be a penalty to this greater forecasting stability, though only time will tell. Forecast stability is vital for informing public policy and response. .
