Andreadis (Center for Vector Biology and Zoonotic Species at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, New Haven, CT, USA), Ecology of West Nile Virus in the North-eastern United States. Professor Diuk-Wasser began by noting that West Nile Virus (WNV) was introduced into New York City in 1999 by unknown means and was now considered endemic throughout the USA, with 29,700 human cases and 1,180 deaths in the USA since 1999. It had been hypothesized that increased biodiversity leads to a decreased risk of exposure to zoonotic pathogens (Keesing et al., 2006) . At issue is whether this 'dilution effect' or 'Zooprophylaxis' for vector-borne pathogens applies only when vectors are generalist feeders, because the link between host diversity and pathogen transmission might break down when vectors exhibit host preferences.",

Previous studies had detected that a large proportion of C. pipiens and C. restuans bloodmeals were derived from American robins (Turdus migratorius), suggesting a key role for this bird species in the WNV transmission cycle (Kilpatrick et al., 2006; Molaei et al., 2006) . The New Haven-based research team tested for preferential feeding by conducting equal choice experiments (robins versus other bird species) (Simpson et al., 2009) and by comparing the proportion of Culex spp. bloodmeals acquired from robins to the proportion of robins in the local bird community. Both methods indicated preferential feeding for robins. They were also able to identify robin communal roosts as amplification foci in greater New Haven (Diuk-Wasser et al., 2010) . Then, through field-informed mathematical modelling, they determined that host preferences were indeed key drivers of WNV transmission and that landscape attributes (such as urbanization) in combination with mosquito abundance and a measure of host community competence were the strongest predictors of pathogen prevalence (Simpson et al., 2011) . Thus, it was clear that pathogen prevalence and human risk of infection were best predicted by assessing the relative pathogen competence and attractiveness to vectors of all species in the host community, rather than using simple measures of biodiversity.",

Krause (Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, USA) stressed that species interactions within a parasite community drive infection risk in a wildlife population (Telfer et al., 2010) . At least five tick-borne pathogens are known to be transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, the principal vector of Lyme disease in the United States: (i) Borrelia burgdorferi, an agent of Lyme disease; (ii) Anaplasma phagocytophilum, an agent of human anaplasmosis; (iii) Babesia microti, an agent of human babesiosis; (iv) Borrelia miyamotoi, an agent of relapsing fever; and (v) the Powassan encephalitis virus. Two or more of these pathogens can be transmitted either simultaneously by a single tick or sequentially by successive tick-bites, resulting in 240 different permutations of mixed-infection studies. In the context of pathogen prevalence of Ixodes scapularis nymphs, Borrelia burgdorferi, has been found in 19.8% of samples from the north-east and mid-western United States, while Babesia miroti has been found in 14.7% of samples from Block Island, Rhode Island.",

Outcomes of mixed infections in mice have been measured by R o , the fitness parameter and basic reproductive rate which indicates the number of secondary tick infections resulting from a primary infection (Levin and Fish, 2004) . The observed outcomes of dual mixed infections have been variable with both positive and negative effects on R o , while interactions have been mutual, unidirectional or null. These diverse pathogen interactions play an important role in determining the infection prevalence of host-seeking nymphs in nature, and consequently, in the risk of infection for humans.",

In a large European Union project, EDEN (Emerging Diseases in a Changing European Environment, 2011), rodent-borne (robo) viral infections have been studied, along with tick-borne pathogens, leishmaniasis, West Nile Virus, malaria and Rift Valley Fever. The most important aim of Professor Henttonen and his colleagues was to clarify the differences in boreal (northern) and temperate Europe in the human epidemiology of nephropathia epidemica, by far the most common hantaviral disease in Europe, caused by Puumala hantavirus (PUUV). The population dynamics of the host species, the bank vole, differ greatly in various parts of Europe, driven by predation in the north and masting events in the temperate zone. Consequently, the causes of rodent fluctuations are different. In addition, the role of landscape patterns (homogenous Taiga vs. fragmented temperate forests) in rodent/virus dispersal is significant, as well as local environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and moisture), which affect virus survival outside the host. For example, in room temperature, PUUV remains infectious for at least 2 weeks outside the host, and possibly for much longer in cold temperatures and in moist conditions. These research findings are essential for human risk evaluation with regard to both long-term and seasonal occurrence of PUUV in the environment. In spite of chronic infection of bank voles and the excretion of PUUV in their faeces, urine and saliva, the shedding period is limited, which has significant implications for seasonal transmission dynamics in rodents. Thus, within the same host/virus system, biomespecific PUUV epidemiologies occur (Kallio et al., 2009; Tersago et al., 2009) , thereby highlighting the need for geographically comparative studies in Europe (METLA, 2012) .",

This virus belongs to the Japanese encephalitis serogroup within the mosquito-borne cluster of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. First isolated from mosquitoes of the genus Culex in South Africa in 1959, the Usutu virus (USUV) has since been isolated from mosquitoes, rodents and birds throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe.

These rapidly evolving, nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses can be transmitted directly from infected individuals and animals, and indirectly through contaminated food and water. Professor Schultz-Cherry's laboratory was the first to demonstrate that astroviruses induce diarrhoea by a novel mechanism: they possess an enterotoxin that disrupts intestinal epithelial barrier function independent of cellular damage or an inflammatory response (Koci et al., 2003) .

Katze (Department of Microbiology and Washington National Primate Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA) set out a unifying approach to molecular biology in his presentation, Systems and Computational biology: Emerging Tools for Exploring Emerging Viruses. He emphasized that modern day virologists and immunologists must do better in their search to understand how a virus kills and how effective vaccines can be developed, especially because traditional virology has yielded surprisingly little information about why some virus strains cause severe diseases while others remain innocuous. He pointed out that the case fatality rate for the 1918 influenza pandemic was about 2.5% and that particular H1N1 virus may have infected as much as one-third of the world's population. Issues arise not only in understanding a virus, but also in understanding how hosts respond. For example, the 1918 virus infection resulted in very high expression of inflammatory, antiviral and immune cell genes very early in host infection (Kash et al., 2006) .",

Such research begins with either in vitro studies of virus replication on cell lines or primary cell cultures, moving to nonhuman primate models of virus infection. Then samples from the experiments are investigated at multiple time points and conditions; and high throughput data are then examined by data processing to prepare systematic evaluations of different host responses. Data integration involving data analysis and modelling of key genes and pathways is then possible, followed by iterative processing of host perturbations and the use of viral mutants to discover specific applications to translational research. Such a systems biology approach requires not only continuing experiments with virusinfected experimental systems but also significant efforts to maintain the hardware and software of an extensive laboratory computational infrastructure. It is this computing infrastructure, which permits the laboratory to go quickly from samples to pathway visualization, as the data analysis workflow moves from microarray images to gene expression data to pathway models.",

The three key characteristics of this integrated approach to so many infectious diseases are as follows: (i) to use cell culture, primary cells, nonhuman primate and human clinical models to study viral infection; (ii) to combine traditional histopathological, virological and biochemical approaches with functional genomics, proteomics and computational biology (Haagmans et al., 2009); and (iii) to obtain signatures of virulence and insights into mechanisms of host defense response, viral evasion and pathogenesis (Casadevaill et al., 2011) .

Already, a good understanding of the 'timing' and extent of immune (innate)-mediated injury after virus infection has been achieved. Furthermore, molecular 'disease' signatures associated with different pathogens in multiple animal species have been described at micro-RNA, mRNA, protein level, metabolite and lipid levels. Such successful modelling of molecular events has made possible verifiable prediction about key nodes and bottlenecks, enabling the identification of novel host cell drug targets (Diamond et al., 2010) .

Aguirre (Department of Environmental Science and Policy, George Mason University and Executive Director, Smithsonian-Mason Global Conservation Studies Program, Front Royal, Virginia, USA) presented Emerging Zoonotic Diseases of Wildlife: Developing Global Capacity for Prediction and Prevention. He began by explaining that Conservation Medicine and more recently EcoHealth have emphasized the need to bridge disciplines, thereby linking human health, animal health and ecosystem health under the paradigm that 'health connects all species in the planet' (Aguirre et al., 2002) . In his view, the recent convergence of global problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, habitat fragmentation, globalization, infectious disease emergence and ecological health demands integrative approaches breaching disciplinary boundaries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) maintains a Red List of threatened species -an important initiative in view of the 869 animal extinctions that have already occurred, of which 3.7% were caused by disease (Smith et al., 2006) . Professor Aguirre noted that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has been a major leader in the global response to the emergence and spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). Since mid-2005, it has programmed approximately $500 million to build capacities in more than 50 countries for monitoring the spread of HPAI among wild bird populations, domestic poultry, and humans, and to mount a rapid and effective containment of the virus when it is found. Recent analyses indicate that these efforts have contributed to significant downturns in reported poultry outbreaks and human infections and a dramatic reduction in the number of countries affected. Furthermore, the USAID Bureau for Global Health, Office of Health, Infectious Disease and Nutrition (GH/HIDN) recently funded two cooperative agreements, PREDICT and RESPOND, under its Avian and Pandemic Influenza and Zoonotic Disease Program to continue and expand this work. The goal of PREDICT is to establish a global early warning system for zoonotic disease emergence that is capable of detecting, tracking and predicting the emergence of new infectious diseases in high-risk wildlife (e.g. bats, rodents and nonhuman primates) that could pose a major threat to human health. The goal of RESPOND is to improve the capacity of countries in high-risk areas to respond to outbreaks of emergent zoonotic diseases that pose a serious threat to human health. The geographical scope of this expanded effort is directed to zoonotic 'hotspots' of wildlife and domestic animal origins (Jones et al., 2008) .",

Now bats have been identified as natural reservoirs for a number of new and emerging viruses -Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Hendra virus and SARS-like coronaviruses. There are some 1000 different bat species; and they often roost in high-density colonies of over one million flying mammals, which have, in a very real sense, been travelling for millions of years, exposing themselves to many pathogens; therefore, the resulting complexity is not surprising.

Of the 1,002 faecal or anal swab samples, 75, that is, 7%, were positive for CoV RNA. The highest prevalence of the virus was in juvenile bats; although rates of prevalence varied from year to year, late spring was the time when the virus peaked. Although bat CoVs persisted within bat populations and their roosts, individually tagged CoV-infected bats cleared their infections within 6 weeks without apparent illness. New world bats of the same species in geographically distinct locations and over the course of several years harbour similar CoVs, and some New World bat CoVs may be able to infect bats of different genera. Strikingly, bats, which had known or potential contact with humans, had a high prevalence of 10-20% of CoV infection. It is clear that significant opportunities exist for zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses from bats to humans and vice versa, especially as more than 95 viruses have already been isolated from or detected in bat tissues.",

In the RBDs of the cat virus, FIPV, Professor Holmes and her research team predicted three loops structurally similar to the NL63 RBMs, and they constructed chimeric FIPV RBDs containing one, two or three RBMs from NL63. Receptor-binding assays using enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA), flow cytometry and co-immunoprecipitation identified three loops (RBMs) in FIPV RBD that are required for binding to feline APN. Furthermore, substitution of only a few key amino acid residues within the RBMs of FIPV altered APN specificity and viral host range.

He explained that there was now a clear scientific consensus that wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a large variety of influenza A viruses. Occasionally these viruses are transmitted from this reservoir to other species, such as chickens, pigs and humans, leading to devastating outbreaks in domestic poultry and the possibility of human influenza pandemics. By the end of February 2010, there had been 15,921 deaths, with the World Health Organization later confirming cases in 171 countries and territories, with deaths in at least 139 countries and territories before the spread of the H1N1 virus diminished.

There is now considerable evidence that HA mutations altering receptor specificity and cell tropism of the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1v) are linked to the D222G amino acid substitution and are associated with a particularly severe outcome of infection (Liu et al., 2010) . It should be remembered that the viral polymerase has to enter the nucleus of the infected cell to promote replication and transcription of the viral genome. Adaptive mutations in polymerase subunits of avian viruses improve binding to importin alpha, a component of the nuclear pore complex in mammalian cells. As a result, nuclear transport of these proteins and efficiency of replication are enhanced. Thus, the interaction of the viral polymerase with the nuclear import machinery is an important determinant of host range.",

Osterhaus (Head, Department of Virology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) began his presentation, Emerging and Neglected Influenza Viruses, by explaining the complex aetiology of the Influenza A, B and C viruses. While humans can serve as host species for all three viruses, Influenza A can also be present in other mammals and avian species, Influenza B in seals and Influenza C in pigs. The severity of the disease is relatively high with Influenza A, moderate with Influenza B and low with Influenza C, with the prevalence in humans high with both Influenza A and B viruses, but lower with Influenza C. Furthermore, a clear distinction needs to be made between seasonal influenza, avian influenza and pandemic influenza. There are two different mechanisms of host adaptation -sequential mutations and genome reassortment. Most recently, the new H1N1 swine flu pandemic outbreak of 2009 drew attention to the speed with which an influenza virus could move around the world. However, the fact that this particular virus was not as virulent as first anticipated proved crucial in confronting the virus, even though it spreads rapidly among humans, unlike the much more virulent H5N1 avian flu virus, from which more than 300 people have died from more than 500 verified cases from 2003 to 2011 (World Health Organization (WHO), 2012).",

Furthermore, Professor Osterhaus pointed out that the recent H1N1 pandemic influenza outbreak indicated that the scientific community was wrong in its earlier belief that 'a pandemic strain could only arise from a subtype that had not previously been widely disseminated in humans [because] the H1N1 virus has shown that human varieties characterized by different hemagglutinin (HA) molecules may follow separate lines of evolution and may generate potentially pandemic strains within an existing human HA subtype.

The pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 virus is not completely understood, although the alveolar macrophage (AM) is thought to play an important role. The AM resides in the pulmonary alveolus, the primary site of HPAI H5N1 virus replication in humans. It had been shown previously that HPAI H5N1 virus attaches abundantly to these AM (van Riel et al., 2006) .

Infection of AM with H3N2 or H1N1 virus resulted in even lower percentages of infected cells (up to 7%) than with HPAI H5N1 virus, while virus production and TNF-alpha induction were comparable. In conclusion, this study revealed that macrophages cultured from monocytes are not a good model to study the interaction between AM and influenza viruses. Furthermore, the interaction between HPAI H5N1 virus and AM could contribute to the pathogenicity of this virus in humans, because of the relatively high percentage of infected cells rather than virus production or an excessive TNF-alpha induction (van Riel et al., 2011 2). One virus of each pair was wild type, while the other carried the H274Y NA mutation conferring resistance to NA inhibitor oseltamivir. Within each pair, the wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant virus caused disease of equal severity in ferrets and replicated to comparable virus titers in the upper respiratory tract. Then, to assess the fitness of drug-resistant H5N1 influenza viruses, the research team considered virus-virus interactions within the host by co-inoculating ferrets with mixtures of the oseltamivirsensitive and oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 viruses in varying ratios (e.g. 100/0; 80/20; 50/50; 20/80; 0/100). Using this novel approach, they demonstrated that the proportion of A/Vietnam/1203/2004-H274Y clones tended to increase, while the proportion of A/Turkey/15/2006-H274Y clones tended to decrease. Their findings suggest that the H274Y NA mutation can affect the fitness of two H5N1 viruses differently and is dependent on background NA sequence. Dr. Govorkova pointed out that antigenic and genetic diversity, virulence, the degree of NA functional loss of H5N1 virus and differences in host immune response can also contribute to such differences. Therefore, the risk of emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses with uncompromised fitness should be monitored closely and considered carefully in pandemic planning.",

Not only were a number of pandemic H1N1 infections in swine detected, but a number of pandemic/endemic swine virus reassortants were found, albeit from healthy animals (Ducatez et al., 2011) . Virologically, the pattern of disease surveillance grounded in the activities of state diagnostic laboratories collecting information from diseased animals is representative; however, epidemiologically this data from diseased animals is not representative. Reverse zoonoses have had a huge impact on SIV in the United States (Vincent et al., 2008) , and the pandemic virus is now endemic. However, in considering whether any particular reassortment causes alarm, it must be acknowledged that there is not yet a good model of risk, so H3, like H1, is going to be found in pigs for some time to come, but the consequences of this diversity in SIV are not yet clear.",

Moreover, the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus has re-emphasised swine as a potential source of pandemic virus. In this study, all of the challenge viruses (avian H5, H7, H9) induced a similar effect in pigs; challenge viruses did replicate in pigs; the infections were subclinical with mild pneumonias; most infections resulted in seroconversion; and none of them transmitted to contact controls. This series of studies suggests pigs could be easily infected with avian viruses; however, an adaptation step is needed to generate fit viruses that transmit among swine. Parallel studies are currently underway testing the susceptibility of pigs to human seasonal influenza viruses. Future studies using reverse genetics could investigate potential genetic markers for adaptation of avian viruses to swine which may provide insight into the interspecies transmission of influenza viruses.",

Infected pigs were co-housed with two groups of sentinel animals to investigate virus maintenance and transmission. The origin of each gene segment of viruses was determined, which were isolated from supernatants collected from co-infected cells or nasal swabs and bronchioalveolar fluid samples collected from infected and sentinel animals. Different reassortant viruses were identified from co-infected cell lines; however, no virus with the genotype of pH1N1 was found. Less reassortant viruses were found in the lungs of co-infected pigs in contrast to those in co-infected cells. Interestingly, only the intact KS07 was detected from nasal swabs from the second group of sentinel pigs. These results demonstrated that multiple reassortant events can occur within the lower respiratory tract of the pig; however, only a specific gene constellation is able to be shed from the upper respiratory tract. However, in this study, it was not possible to generate the pH1N1 constellation using co-infection with the techniques described above and previously (Ma et al., 2010b) .",

Swine exhibited an elevated transcriptional response that tapered by resolution of influenza. Mice exhibited a decrease in many acute phase and immune response genes quickly followed by a steady increase in expression. Host response in macaques was most pronounced and maintained over time. In considering the transcription of immune-related genes in swine, mice and nonhuman primates, they found that although the number of immune-related genes changing in each species was similar, the precise genes changing were very different, with only 14 immune response genes commonly differentially expressed across all three species. This suggested that the nature of immune response within each species may be quite different.",

In a further investigation into the same hantavirus, Dr. Eckerle and her colleagues have presented an article within this Special Supplement entitled Atypical Severe Puumala Hantavirus Infection and Virus Sequence Analysis of the Patient and Regional Reservoir Host. In this article, they focus on the difficulties in the diagnosis of and treatment for a single patient and performed virus sequence analysis showing regional clustering in reservoir and host. In their more wide-ranging conference presentation, they investigated cytokine expression in a cohort of patients hospitalized with acute severe hantavirus infection during an epidemic in Germany in 2010 (cf. Faber et al., 2010) . Elevated proinflammatory cytokines during the early phase of disease compared to healthy controls and increase in immunosuppressive TGF-b from early to later phase of disease supported the hypothesis of an immune-mediated pathogenesis of Puumala hantavirus (Sadeghi et al., 2011) . This finding indicates that the immune status of the host for old-world hantaviruses plays an important role, not only the virus itself.",

They noticed that while in Huh7, CCHFV infection elicited at day 3 a cytopathogenic effect, no visible effect was seen in CCHFV-infected HepG2. This intriguing feature led them to analyse the viral parameters expecting a differential cellular response. Both cell lines were shown to be permissive to CCHFV and with a high viral yield as monitored by plaque titration assay, genomic and antigenomic strand quantification. These CCHFV-infected hepatocarcinoma cell lines induced only IL-8 secretion. In addition, a pro-apoptotic effect was observed in Huh7 but not in HepG2. Interestingly, no type-I IFN was detected for Hep-G2 during the kinetic study, suggesting a strong inhibition of IFN secretion. They concluded that CCHFV does enter and replicate in hepatocytes and that hepatocytes could be involved in CCHF pathogenesis associated with antigen presenting cells for CCHFV dissemination. While CCHFV did not induce IFN-Beta secretion in hepatocyte cell lines, CCHFV did induce the secretion of IL-1 in hepatocyte cell lines. Furthermore, CCHFV induced a higher secretion of IL-8 in the apoptotic Huh 7 cell line than in the nonapoptotic Hep-G2 cell line. Thus, this research indicated that IL-8 production and apoptosis seemed to be markers of CCHFV pathogenesis in hepatocyte cell lines.",

First, it was pointed out that removing infected tissues from high-containment laboratories requires implementation of a number of different decontamination techniques to render the organism inert and is subject to flexibility according to the laws of the country in which the laboratory is located. According to the Canadian Biosafety Guidelines 4th edition, an organism may be removed from containment once it has been rendered inert, but no procedure is in place to validate these biosafety guidelines, and it is up to the individuals to implement the relevant guidelines (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2004, p. 28. Chap. 3.1.4). Methods such as gamma irradiation, formalin fixation, acetone and methanol permeation, plus the use of various other chemical agents, are common practices to preserve cellular tissue or blood components and to inactivate organisms (Elliott et al., 1982; Mitchell and McCormick, 1984; Preuss et al., 1997; Villinger et al., 1999; Sanchez et al., 2007) .

The focus of the Applied Biosafety Research Program was to evaluate and develop technologies and procedures relevant to biocontainment in the context of the laboratory, as well as to prevent unintentional and intentional release of dangerous organisms into the environment.",

Such collaboration is especially important in studying tick-borne infectious disease, which emerged so extensively in the United States during the last three decades of the twentieth century (Paddock and Yabsley, 2007, p. 290) . Now, in an article published in this Special Supplement, Beyond Lyme: Etiology of Tick-Borne Human Disease with Emphasis on the Southeastern United States, Drs. Stomdahl and Hickling have explained that tick distributions are in flux, especially in the south-eastern United States, requiring health providers to think 'beyond Lyme' to identify the specific tick species that bite humans and the different pathogens these ticks carry. In an international context, Drs. Wood and Artsob have set out the increasing importance of travel-associated rickettsioses in their article, Spotted Fever Group Rickettsiae: A Brief Review and a Canadian Perspective. In a third article published in this Special Supplement, Drs. Verma and Stevenson present an article on epidemiology of leptospirosis with its one million cases worldwide. In Leptospiral Uveitis -There's More to It Than Meets the Eye! they hypothesize in detail about how the eye inflammation uveitis is triggered and stress the impact that 'understanding how this bacterium is able to induce this inflammatory process will be a key to the better management and prevention of the disease'. This continuum of basic research leading to understanding a disease and then to managing that disease and finally to preventing it offers a pattern of scientific discovery that is relevant to many other emerging zoonotic diseases. Opening his presentation, The Foodborne Pathogen Campylobacter jejuni Exploits Mammalian Host Cell Receptors and Signaling Pathways, Professor Konkel noted that the per cent of C. jejuni isolates that are resistant to antibiotics is continuing to increase and that C. jejuni infections are frequently associated with serious sequelae, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. It is well understood that infection with C. jejuni is often a consequence of eating foods contaminated with undercooked poultry. However, C. jejuni pathogenesis is a highly complex process that is dependent on many factors including motility, adherence, cell invasion, protein secretion, intracellular survival and toxin production. Acute illness, characterized by the presence of blood and leucocytes in stool samples, is specifically associated with C. jejuni invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. Dissecting bacteria-host cell interactions are critical to understanding the infection caused by C. jejuni.",

To test the hypothesis that maximal cell invasion requires specific signalling events, binding and internalization assays were performed in the presence of numerous inhibitors of cell signaling pathways. The research team found that C. jejuni cell invasion utilizes components of Focal Complexes (FCs), as invasion is significantly inhibited by wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI-3 kinase) and PP2 (a c-Src inhibitor). They further demonstrated that a wild-type strain of C. jejuni results in the activation of the Rho GTPase Rac1. These observations are consistent with the proposal that C. jejuni binding to host cell-associated Fn and secretion of the Cia proteins trigger integrin receptor activation, which in turn promotes intracellular signalling and actin cytoskeletal rearrangement. On the basis of these data, they concluded that C. jejuni utilizes a novel mechanism to promote host cell invasion. The research findings Professor Konkel presented were recently published in Cellular Microbiology (Eucker and Konkel, 2012) .",

The creation of an algorithm for the development of an appropriate LF test to identify biopathogens requires the development of a target antigen, obtaining specific antibodies (Biketov et al., 2010) and then creating a LF-test formulation to be trial tested. The target antigens must have the ability to induce species-specific antibodies, as well as be characterized by surface localization with multiple epitope presentation on the surface. The antibodies need to have a specificity and sensitivity sufficient for application in the LF detection format, as well as the capacity to be preserved after labelling with gold particles and after immobilization on a surface.",

Their presentation, titled Novel SYBR \u00d2 Real-time PCR Assay for Detection and Differentiation of Mycoplasma Species in Biological Samples From Various Hosts, began by explaining the relevance of Mycoplasma species, which are endemic, strict or opportunistic pathogens in human and animal medicine. Moreover, Mycoplasma species are important re-emerging pathogens and foreign animal diseases. Importantly, Mycoplasma species are difficult to culture or are un-culturable, and thus are difficult to impossible to detect by conventional diagnostic methods. Moreover, current PCR methods have limited breath of species detection and differentiation, requiring the use of species-specific assays that are costly and time-consuming. Their goal was to develop a pilot Mycoplasma genus diagnostic assay to validate the novel application of high-resolution melt (HRM) methodology for rapid, sensitive and cost-effective detection and differentiation of various pathogenic mycoplasma species.",

In all three of these areas -basic research, practical action and an integrated One Health-oriented approach -much has been achieved in recent years, but much also remains to be achieved as soon as possible.

However, it had been controlled in Zimbabwe until 2001 when financial constraints forced the government veterinary services to curtail disease surveillance and discontinue free vaccinations. Small-scale farmers did not seek vaccination from other sources, partly because they were unaware of the necessity of vaccination, and also at that time brucellosis was absent from small-scale farming areas. However, uncontrolled cattle movements from 2000 to 2009 linked to invasions of large-scale farms resulted in dispersal of possibly brucella-positive cattle and movement of the disease into small-scale herds. The result was that brucellosis became a potential problem in these herds and now presents a serious zoonotic threat.",

Although there is no human-to-human spread of the disease, it is essential that people do not handle new-born calves or abortions from brucella-positive cows, nor drink unpasteurized milk from brucella-positive cows (Arimi et al., 2005) . In essence, reducing the risk of brucellosis requires that farmers adopt appropriate preventive behaviours, with these control efforts and changes in behaviour being communitydirected in order to be sustainable. It was this stress upon community direction that formed the basis for funding by the Wellcome Trust to investigate the hypothesis that the level of a farmer's knowledge about brucellosis would influence subsequent preventive behaviour. The approach, based partly on the 'Health Belief Model' (Rosenstock et al., 1988) was grounded in the expectation that each small-scale farmer would make health behaviour choices according to individual perceptions about the disease and personal beliefs about their abilities and the costs required to change the risks of their cattle and families acquiring the disease. In this project, the independent variable was the level of an individual farmer's knowledge about brucellosis, while the dependent variables were two key preventive behaviours -decreasing cattle disease by calfhood vaccination and preventing zoonotic disease by milk pasteurization.",

The aim was to tailor the educational program to the initial knowledge or awareness of each community of farmers, recognizing the considerable difference in knowledge levels between-and within communities. Local teams, not outsiders, developed appropriate educational materials, targeting those with the lowest levels of knowledge. Completed survey questionnaires indicated a significant relationship between the initial level of farmers' knowledge about brucellosis and their calf brucellosis vaccination practices. The range of brucellosis knowledge among some 210 small-scale farmers in Southern Zimbabwe was considerable, with 38% of farmers being unaware of the disease, 12% having limited knowledge and 50% having good knowledge. However, even amongst those farmers with a relatively high level of knowledge, 78% of farmers had not vaccinated their calves at the time of the survey. Furthermore, there was a disappointingly low uptake of milk boiling despite a significant increase in knowledge about raw milk as a mode of infection for humans. Although the information sessions did increase farmers' awareness of the dangers of zoonotic brucellosis, an exaggerated perception of the effectiveness of calf vaccination decreased the likelihood of safe milk practices. This outcome indicated the importance of reaching the women who were responsible for milk and food preparation.",

The research team found alarming rates of resistance to antimicrobials in zoonotic bacteria and commensals, as set out in their article, which could compromise the effective treatment for human infections. This work provides a basis on which to improve both risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies in the face of the increasing antimicrobial resistance to zoonotic bacteria and parasitic organisms within both humans and animals. Second, in American Trypanosomiasis Infection in Fattening Pigs from the South-East of Mexico, M.

He began by noting that each year in the United States, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control, 48 million people become sick from food-borne diseases, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die. A significant portion of these diseases have a zoonotic origin, with extensive product recalls and domestic as well as international trade disruptions (Fung et al., 2001) . Therefore, more than 20 years ago, the US Department of Agriculture established a Food Safety Consortium (2011) which focuses on food-borne zoonotic diseases involving beef in Kansas, pork in Iowa and poultry in Arkansas. The continuing aim of that consortium is to develop long-term control strategies that identify the critical control points and control technologies, as well as short-term strategies to address incidental contamination, whether accidental or intentional.",

Listeria monocytogenes, a non-sporulating, gram-positive bacillus, is found chiefly in ruminants, but can affect all species and causes listeriosis, an infrequent but serious illness that affects the central nervous system of humans and domestic animals (Bortolussi, 2008; Chan and Weidmann, 2009 ). Listeriosis can be acquired from the consumption of contaminated foods and has an incubation period ranging from 2 to 70 days (Bortolussi, 2008; Chan and Weidmann, 2009 ). Because of this variable incubation period and the fact that listeriosis leads to a mortality rate of 20-30%, the Applied Biosafety Research Program at the National Microbiology Laboratory of The Public Health Agency of Canada considered the significance of proper decontamination of listeria in food processing environments (Chan and Weidmann, 2009 ). The importance of this work is indicated by the fact that somewhere from 1 to 10% of ready-to-eat foods are thought to be contaminated with listeria (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2004 and .",

As a result of these studies, major Canadian food-processing plants have changed their decontamination procedures and are no longer using Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (Quats), which were previously used extensively. Positive relations have been built up between companies and laboratories, leading to more relevant laboratory studies and industrial applications (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2012).",

Although two Nobel Prizes in Medicine have been awarded for prion research, to Carleton Gajusek in 1966 and to Stanley Prusiner in 1997, the precise nature of the infectious agent remains unclear to such an extent that controversy continues about whether a prion is solely protein (Brooks, 2011, pp. 75-100) .

Since then, animal and human prion diseases have been transmitted to a range of NHPs. Cynomolgus macaques have shown the highest selectivity with regard to the prion strain by which they can be infected and therefore seem to be the species of choice to assess the risk that any given animal prion strain can be pathogenic for humans (Lasm\u00e9zas et al., 1996) .",

However, the oral transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to domestic cats in 1990 forced a revision of this earlier belief. Transmissions of BSE have now occurred orally to sheep, goat, monkey, mink, cheetah, puma, cat and mouse. Intracerebral transmission of BSE has also occurred to pig. Furthermore, intraspecies oral transmission of BSE has taken place within numerous speciesmonkey, mink, sheep, goat, cow, hamster and mouse. vCJD (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) is a new human disease, which was caused by eating ruminant-derived food products contaminated with BSE. vCJD poses a public health problem because of the absence of preclinical diagnostic test, the long incubation periods of prion diseases in humans (possibly extending up to 50 years) and the transmissibility of the disease by blood transfusion.",

Further, the research team used the macaque model to assess the zoonotic potential of emerging forms of BSE called L-or H-type. The L-type BSE presents with higher pathogenicity to macaques than classical BSE (Comoy et al., 2008) . Therefore, continued precautionary measures remain necessary to protect the human food chain.

There was some variation among different animals. However, a distinct accumulation of PrP Sc was observed in the distal ileum, confined to follicles and/or the enteric nervous system, in almost all animals . BSE prions were found in the sympathetic nervous system starting from 16 months post-inoculation (mpi) on as well as in the parasympathetic nervous system from 20 mpi on (Kaatz et al., 2012) . A clear dissociation of prion infectivity and detectable PrP Sc deposition was obvious in tongue (Balkema- . The earliest presence of infectivity in the brainstem was detected at 24 mpi, while PrP Sc -accumulation was detected first after 28 mpi. In summary, these results deciphered for the first time the centripetal spread of BSE prions along the ANS to the CNS starting already half way during the incubation period. BSE prions spread in cattle from the gut to the brain along the sympathetic, parasympathetic and spinal cord routes, possibly in that order of importance. Spinal cord involvement may even not be necessary at all, but BSE infectivity in the form of PrP Sc spills over into the periphery already in the pre-clinical phase.",

Of the five papers relevant to this topic, two have been published in full below in this Special Supplement. Dr. G. Zanella and her colleagues consider Modelling Transmission of Bovine Tuberculosis in Red Deer and Wild Boar in Normandy, France. Their mathematical model of the Mycobacterium bovis infection within and between species takes into account the transmission of M. bovis through infected offal -the viscera of animals killed by hunters and left behind. When an animal was hunted in the Brotonne Forest in Normandy prior to 2002, it was eviscerated in situ and only the carcass taken away, with the raw viscera left behind. Since 2002, offal disposal has been required in Brotonne forest; however, the regulation has not always been observed by hunters (unpublished correspondence with G. Zanella, 16-17 December, 2011) An important benefit of mathematical modelling is that it permits consideration of all the elements involved in disease transmission within a population, thereby complementing field data, as well as testing the effects of control measures. Thus, the direct transmission of the M. bovis infection within the red deer and wild boar populations can be distinguished from indirect transmission through contaminated offal. The model indicates that offal destruction is the key factor in infection control for both red deer and wild boar. The authors conclude that, in principle, the structure of this model is relevant to the situations where dead animals play an important role in disease transmission between two or more species.",

Gonz\u00e1lez-Salazar and Professor C. Stephens set out the role of ecological networks as a powerful tool for understanding and visualizing inter-species ecological and evolutionary interactions. Taking the example of leishmaniasis in Mexico, they show that such networks can be used not only to understand potential ecological interactions between species involved in the transmission of the disease, but also to identify the potential role of the environment in disease transmission and dispersal. Strikingly, they show how potential interactions can be inferred from geographical data, rather than by direct observation. Their findings have led to the prediction of additional reservoirs in Mexico of many new species, including bats and squirrels. The resulting model can be used to understand and map potential transmission risk, as well as construct risk scenarios for the dispersal of leishmaniasis from one geographical region to another. Such a risk assessment tool for leishmaniasis will be especially useful in the light of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation decision in January 2012 to join with 13 major pharmaceutical companies and the World Health Organization in targeting leishmaniasis as one of the neglected tropical diseases to receive improved drugs, diagnostics, vector control strategies and vaccines (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 2012; Boseley, 2012) . However, the possibility of new reservoirs suggests it is hard to imagine that leishmaniasis can be completely eradicated. Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear that leishmaniasis has a disturbing capacity to jump from species to species, so efforts to control the disease must be given a high priority (Unpublished correspondence with C. Stephens, February 1, 2012; cf. Flanagan et al., 2011) .",

This was the view of Professor G. C. Gray (Emerging Pathogens Institute and College of Public Health and Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA) in his presentation, Modeling Risk Factors for Zoonotic Influenza Infections in Man: Challenges and Strategies for Success. In particular, serologic detections of these infections in humans may be confounded by crossreacting antibody, waning antibody from the infection of interest, inaccurate matching of the enzootic pathogen and the laboratory strain, laboratory errors and weakly powered statistical comparisons.",

These three factors can be viewed as a Venn diagram with its intricate interactions. Like understanding cardiovascular disease, how a person acquires a zoonotic influenza infection is a complex process, and predictive laboratory assays are imprecise. For example, with avian influenza viruses (especially H5N1, popularly known as 'Bird Flu'), poultry veterinarians, turkey workers, hunters and people without indoor plumbing may be at increased risk of AIV infection but infections are rare. Subclinical or mild infections do occur; and occasionally AIV causes severe disease in persons exposed to sick birds. Although AIV transmission from human-to-human seems rare, further cohort studies and more sensitive serological assays are needed.",

            "text": "A basic scientist often tests hypotheses by: (i) carefully setting up an experimental setting; (ii) isolating confounding factors; and (iii) looking for statistically significant associations with an outcome. Such a process is not possible for a number of emerging disease problems such as human infections with swine influenza virus (SIV). Experimental studies are not possible. Hence, epidemiologists must perform observational studies of people most likely to be infected with SIV and by looking at possible risk factor associations, infer causality. One must first determine settings where the prevalence of SIV in expected to be high and then study those workers. For example, SIVs are often endemic in large-scale modern production facilities. Risk factors for sow-herd SIV seropositivity involve pig density, whether there is an external source of breeding pigs, the total animals on the site and the closeness of barns. Similarly, risks factors for finisherherd SIV positivity must be considered -the number of SIV-positive sows, size of herd, pig farm density and farrow-to-finish type of farm (Poljak et al., 2008) . However, SIV surveillance in pigs is largely passive and voluntary, so recognizing which pig workers to study is a challenge. Detection of SIV infections in man often requires a sentinel event (e.g. human illness with pig exposure or sick pigs). As pigs do not always have clinical signs of novel virus infection and often there is no compensation system to protect pig farmers, the pork industry is reluctant to permit the study of their workers for SIV infection (Gray and Baker, 2011) . Therefore, these observational studies are currently very difficult. Professor Gray concluded by pointing out that although there are numerous challenges in conducting epidemiological studies for zoonotic influenza, there are six substantive ways to control confounding variables: (i) design every study carefully; (ii) use non-animal-exposed controls; (iii) employ validated laboratory assay using zoonotic influenza strains; (iv) use multivariate modeling to examine cross-reacting serologic responses due to human viruses and vaccines; (v) consider proportional odds modeling; and (vi) consider employing a second unique serologic test (See GPL, 2012) .",

Vectorial competence is dependent upon the Extrinsic Incubation (EI) period in the mosquito vector. The EI represents the time from ingestion of the virus while feeding on a viremic host to the virus arriving in the salivary glands. The shorter the EI period, which occurs during higher ambient temperatures, the greater the vectorial competence (Garrett- Jones and Shidrawi, 1969) . If data are available for a specific local area on the daily humanbiting rate (ha) of the mosquitoes, the daily rate of blood feeding (a) and the length of the EI cycle (n), it is possible to calculate vectorial capacity (Rattanarithikul et al., 1996) .",

Dr. Guillossou pointed out that there were more than 15 different methods for determining a 95% confidence interval of a proportion. He stressed that it is always important to report the method of statistical analysis being utilized. In his view, the Agresti-Coull interval approach presents a satisfactory compromise between computational requirements and coverage probability (Newcombe, 1998; Brown et al., 2001) . Ideally, the effects of coverage probability should be estimated and the most appropriate method chosen before reporting the findings or using proportions as inputs in any epidemiological study.",

The reality is, as Professor Nathan Wolfe, Professor in Human Biology at Stanford University, has commented: 'As a species, we're not that focused on the things that have the most potential to be devastating to us as a global population, such as viruses. Unless people take these things seriously, we're going to look back and say we had all the tools necessary to try to address these risks, and we basically ignored them because they weren't dramatic like a car accident or a hurricane' (Geddes, 2011; Kahn, 2011; Wolfe, 2011) .

Their focus was on how the EBOV-glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) facilitated viral entry and promoted viral release from human cells. They compared EBOV-GP interactions with human cells and cells from African fruit bats, leading to the finding that GP displayed similar biological properties in human and bat cells. The only exception was GP localization, which was to a greater extent intracellular in bat cells as compared to human cells. Collectively their results suggested that GP interactions with fruit bat and human cells are similar and do not limit EBOV tropism for certain bat species.Thepresentation by Dr. E. de Wit with her colleagues, V.
