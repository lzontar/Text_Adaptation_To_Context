The Malthusian League was founded in England in 1860 to spread the message of birth control.

China, though initially opposed to family planning in the line with its communist ideology, went for it in 1962, a more aggressive policy of 'one child for one couple'. Family planning methods were facilitated by advancements in sterilization, intrauterine device, pills and condoms. In India, family planning was given special place in the country's first 5-year plan (1951) (1952) (1953) (1954) (1955) (1956) . It was placed under the control of Ministry of Health and, in 1977, its nomenclature was changed to Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Feed is a significant factor in increasing the productivity and profitability in the aquaculture sector (Jamu and Ayinla 2003) . From economic point of view, feed cost and feed management account for at least 60% of the production cost and appear to be one of the major constraints against the greater expansion of aquaculture (Kaushik 1990) . Present knowledge and understanding of the environmental impacts of shrimp feed among aquaculturists and nutritionists are very low and needs further refinement.

Therefore, supply of inputs (feeds, fertilizers etc.) has to be ensured so that the nutrients and energy requirements of the species under cultivation are met and the production goals of the system are achieved (Hasan 2001) . The nutrient balance of feed influences feed utilization and growth of fish. It is very essential to know the nutritional requirements particularly for protein, lipid and energy for optimum growth of fish species as well as in formulating a balanced diet. Dietary protein and energy levels are known to influence the growth and body composition of fish (Lovell 1989) . Improper protein and energy levels in feed increase fish production cost and deteriorates water quality. Insufficient energy in diets causes protein waste due to the increase proportion of dietary protein used for energy and the produced ammonia can reduce the water quality (Phillips 1972; Prather and Lovell 1973; Shyong et al. 1998 ). On the contrary, excessive energy in diets can lead to increased body lipid deposition and growth reduction because of lack of necessary nutrient for growth (Daniels and Robinson 1986; Van der Meer et al. 1997) . This is often the case seen in case of traditional meal which has resulted in deterioration of water quality parameters in the control pond (Table 11 .A.5). In the present study, the specially formulated feed prepared from C. repens had optimum protein, lipid, carbohydrate and astaxanthin content and the values were also within the recommended nutrient levels for fish (National Research Council 1983) . Protein is the major growth promoting factor in feed. The protein requirement of fish are influenced by various factors such as fish size, water temperature, feeding rate, availability and quality of natural foods and overall digestible energy content of diet (Satoh 2000; Wilson 2000) . In the present study, protein level in formulated feed was found to be 28.29 \u00b1 0.58% in comparison to 32 \u00b1 2.65% in traditional feed. Lipids are primarily included in formulated diet to maximize their protein sparing effect (Hasan Fig. 11 .A.13 Fortnightly variations of organic carbon in control (C) and experimental (E) ponds 2001) by being a source of energy. Low lipid content of the specially formulated feed results in greater binding efficiency and more pellet water stability. Lipid values were found to be lower in specially formulated feed indicating the efficiency of the present feed in maintaining water stability. Carbohydrate levels in feed are the most suitable sources of energy for shrimps. The best carbohydrate sources of shrimp feed are those derived from low-cost practical ingredients (e.g. wheat flour, rice bran, etc.). The formulated feed in the present study also supports the above view (Tables 11.A.1 and 11.A.3). Use of C. repens as astaxanthin supplement (source of carotenoid) has increased the antioxidative property of the feed and resulted in higher pigment concentration in shrimp species of experimental pond (Tables 11.A.3 and 11.A.2).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 464, "end": 476, "text": "(Hasan 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 832, "end": 845, "text": "(Lovell 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1138, "text": "(Phillips 1972;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1163, "text": "Prather and Lovell 1973;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1182, "text": "Shyong et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1370, "text": "(Daniels and Robinson 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1396, "text": "Van der Meer et al. 1997)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1802, "text": "(National Research Council 1983)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2065, "end": 2077, "text": "(Satoh 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2090, "text": "Wilson 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2317, "end": 2331, "text": "(Hasan Fig. 11", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1539, "end": 1548, "text": "(Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Feed Quality"}, {"text": "The present case study exhibited significant weight gain in experimental pond compared to control pond (p < 0.05).

Carotenoid pigmentation is affected by dietary pigment source, dosage level, duration of feeding, dietary composition, degree of carotenoid esterification, etc. (Meyers and Latscha 1997; Bjerkeng 2000; Buttle et al. 2001; Gomes et al. 2002; White et al. 2002) .

Surface water temperature in both the culture ponds showed more or less parallel trend of variation throughout the study period. This is reflected in the ANOVA results which showed no significant variation of the parameter between the control and experimental ponds as well as between the culture periods. The uniformity in temperature profile is due to the location of both the ponds in the same site that experience similar weather and climate. Water temperature plays a major role in shrimp enzyme kinetics which may have a regulatory influence on their growth . It also affects the process of moulting during the post larval stage of shrimps (WWF-India 2006) . In the present study, no significant relationship was observed between condition index of shrimp and surface water temperature. The salinity of the Hugli-Matla estuarine complex is known to exhibit intensive variations (Saha et al. Saha et al. 1995) . The selected station, Canning is located in the Matla estuarine stretch, which is known for its dynamics in tidal condition. ANOVA results showed significant spatial (between ponds) and temporal (between months) variation of salinity (p < 0.05). The relatively higher C.I. values in the experimental pond with less salinity (4.08 \u00b1 0.16 psu) prove the efficiency of formulated feed in combating the stress posed by salinity which in turns increases the astaxanthin level in the cultured species (Kobayashi et al. 1992; Tjahjono et al. 1994; Harker et al. 1996; Boussiba 2000; Sarada et al. 2002) . Shrimp culture directly affects the pH of the pond bottom through deposition of excess feed, shrimp excreta, dead shrimps, etc. These shift the soil and overlying aquatic pH towards acidic condition. In the present study, such condition was not observed at culture site owing to the traditional practice of liming at a regular interval of time in the lower Gangetic region. ANOVA result also confirmed the above view as no significant variations of pH between the ponds was observed. High organic carbon load was observed in the control pond due to use of traditional feed resulting in low pH. ANOVA result shows significant variation of organic carbon content between the ponds (p < 0.05). D.O. is a vital parameter regulating the aquatic life. The shrimp health is a direct function of dissolved oxygen and its diurnal variation. Excessive organic load in the system results in lowering the D.O. value posing threat to the survival of aquatic life. In the present study, the D.O. level in the control pond showed lower value owing to deposition of organic carbon at the bottom of the pond. ANOVA result confirmed the significant variation of D.O. between the ponds. Transparency controls the phytoplankton standing stock in shrimp culture ponds due to their dependency on the solar radiation for photosynthesis. This parameter has thus a major role in regulating the phytopigment level and coloration of shrimp pond water. The formulated feed provided in the experimental pond showed increased transparency of the water due to its unique binding property. This upgraded the water quality as reflected by the high-condition index values of the shrimps in the experimental pond. The above statement was confirmed by ANOVA results which showed significant variation of transparency between the ponds (p < 0.05).

ANOVA results showed significant variation of nitrate between the ponds (p < 0.05) which may be due to the leaching of the feed ingredients (particularly from animal component in traditional feed) in pond water and also the faecal matter that generates ammonia (Mitra and Choudhury 1995) . ANOVA results for the phosphate concentration during the study period showed no significant variation between the ponds. For silicate the variation between the ponds was significant (p < 0.05) which may be attributed to difference in bed materials of the ponds. Phytopigment (Chl a) are indicators of aquatic productivity and standing stock of phytoplankton. Although higher concentration of phytopigment signify eutrophic condition of water, but their presence in optimum level is healthy for shrimp growth as the phytoplankton constitute the natural diet of shrimp. In the present study, an optimum Chl a concentration and lower nutrient values in the experimental pond proves the effective utilization of nutrients by aquatic phytoplankton. ANOVA results showed no significant variation of Chl a between the ponds as well as between the culture periods, implying healthy growth of the cultured species. Aquaculture has become a peak industry in the present millennium, which involves seafood farming with shrimp, cuttlefish, squid, lobster and other such culinary delights actually 'cultivated' in aquatic enclosures under scientifically controlled conditions (Rajkhowa 2005) . The use of nutrient-rich feed continues to gain wide acceptance in the aquaculture industry in order to boost up the quality of the aquacultural products. The use of quality feed results in substantial reduction in the overall variable cost of an operation through improved animal performance, better FCR and improved water quality due to a reduction in the amount of nutrients and solids (i.e. faeces and uneaten food) in the waste water effluent. C. repens-based formulated feed showed better growth performance of the cultured species with respect to condition index values and survival rate. Body pigmentation improved in the cultured species of experimental pond and showed significantly higher astaxanthin level than the controlled pond. cost-benefit analysis (CBA) reflects high profitability of using floral-based feed instead of the traditional feed. A series of experiments are still needed for time testing the results and make the programme sustainable for the poor island dwellers of lower Gangetic delta.

The rate of growth is measured by an increase in the number of individuals in a population per unit time. For controlling the growth of population, natality and mortality are important factors. The percentage ratio of natality and mortality is termed vital index. Population growth is the result of interaction of biotic potential and environmental resistance. Two distinct patterns of population growth are identified, namely, S-shaped growth (Sigmoid) and J-shaped growth. (D) The distribution of population in the world is highly non-uniform. Some areas are thickly populated while some are sparsely populated. There are various reasons behind uneven distribution of population that can be can be categorized in to geographical factors, social and cultural factors and economic factors. The geographical factors include favourable topography, availability of mineral and freshwater resources, favourable climate soil fertility and food security that invite population and help to flourish. The social and cultural factors encompass areas of better housing, education and health facilities and religious harmony. Places of religious and cultural significance also attract people, e.g. Varanasi, Jerusalem, etc. The economic factors invite population due to presence of more industries, transportation and communication facilities, employment opportunities, etc. (E) Family planning policy has been adopted to give a check to population explosion. The net result of this family planning concept is visualized when one critically compares the average annual exponential growth rates between1991-2001 and 2001-2011  for India. In all the States and Union Territories, the average annual exponential growth rate has reduced in2001-2011 compared to 1991-2001.
