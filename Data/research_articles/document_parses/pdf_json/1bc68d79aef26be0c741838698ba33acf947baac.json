            "text": "Over the past century microbiologists have searched for more rapid and efficient means of microbial identification. Clinical microbiologists and microbiology laboratories are experiencing changes due to evolving views on \"healthcare delivery\" as an economic activity, due to changes in the medical environment and the demographics of the workforce, and technical evolution. The identification and differentiation of microorganisms has principally relied on microbial morphology and growth variables. Cost-effectiveness of laboratory procedures has been achieved through consolidation and integration of laboratories. Consolidation offers economy of scale and reduction in numbers of on-site staff, but also leads to separation of microbiologists from their clinical colleagues. Integration puts different laboratory disciplines under a single management, and leads to reorganisation of laboratories along common work-lines. Cost-savings combined with on-site availability of laboratories are achieved at the expense of a reduction in the influence of microbiologists in the daily running of the laboratory.",

Increased clinical relevance of microbiological testing through rapid testing is mandatory. There is an increasing shortage in Europe and the USA of trained microbiology laboratory technicians and microbiologists. This reinforces the trend towards more automation and integration. Technological advances, particularly in molecular diagnostics, offer the possibility of rapid reporting and improvement of the impact of clinical microbiology on patient management. Molecular tests, however, fit perfectly the concept of an integrated laboratory and may further loosen the link between microbiologist and microbiology tests. The challenge for clinical microbiology will be to use new techniques to improve its cost-effectiveness and impact on infectious disease management (Pfaller, 2001) . The future organisation of microbiology laboratories must support this but is itself of secondary importance.",

PCR-based systems to detect the etiologic agents of disease directly from clinical samples, without the need for culture, have been useful in rapid detection of uncultivable or fastidious microorganisms. These technologies, however, like the determinations of phenotypic variables, are limited by microbial recovery and growth. Rapid techniques of nucleic acid amplification and characterization have significantly broadened the microbiologists diagnostic arsenal. Additionally, sequence analysis of amplified microbial DNA allows for identification and better characterization of the pathogen. Subspecies variation, identified by various techniques, has been shown to be important in the prognosis of certain diseases. Other important advances include the determination of viral load and the direct detection of genes or gene mutations responsible for drug resistance.

Traditionally, different methods of detection are used for each group of intestinal pathogens. This requires special media, equipment, and expensive facilities for the culture of mycobacteria; expertise in the identification of parasites in ova and parasite stool preparations; virology facilities; and special media for the workup of bacterial enteric pathogens.

RT-PCR has played an important role in diagnosing RNA-containing virus infections, detecting viable Mycobacteria species, and monitoring the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. For diagnostic uses, multiplex PCR can be set up to detect internal controls or to detect multiple pathogens from a single specimen (Roberts and Storch, 1997) . Another important technical modification is the development of broad-range PCR, in which conserved sequences within phylogenetically informative genetic targets are used to diagnose microbial infection. A broad-range PCR approach has identified several novel, fastidious, or uncultivated bacterial pathogens directly from infected human tissue or blood (Relman et al., 1996) .

By use of molecular methods, the microbial load of an infecting pathogen may be determined and its genotype may also be evaluated. Viral load data are used to monitor therapeutic responsiveness and may yield prognostic information regarding the progression of disease. Until recently, however, the task of quantitative nucleic acid amplification has been very difficult to accomplish. Because the amplification techniques yielded products in an exponential manner until a plateau was reached, any factor interfering with the exponential nature of the amplification process would therefore affect the result of the quantitative assay. In practice, many factors can affect the efficiency of the PCR reaction throughout the amplification procedures and result in the differences between theoretical and actual yields of the reaction. Now, however, kit-based technologies make it possible for many laboratories to carry out quantitative determinations.",

Patients with Whipple disease often have gastrointestinal manifestations and undergo endoscopy. Small bowel biopsies reveal foamy histiocytes filling the lamina propria. The definitive diagnosis is made with the identification of non-acid-fast, periodic acid-shift-positive, diastase-resistant bacillary forms within the histiocytes.

Again, fragile organisms may die in transit or become overgrown by contaminating bacteria, thereby making the subsequent culture useless. If molecular microbiology facilities are not available in community laboratories, nucleic acids extracted by the use of commercially available kits may be sent frozen to molecular reference facilities.

Questions regarding basic laboratory issues including the clinical need, the cost benefit for testing the patent, and other issues as well as direct and indirect costs must be addressed and answered. Of great import, the specific clinical niche for the amplification test (i.e., the clinical question that a PCR result will answer) must also be delineated.

Because of what is at stake -managing antimicrobial agent resistance -it clearly appears in the best interest of all to develop a modernized set of regulations that facilitate development and application of this testing.",

However, it is essential that key decisions be made prior to further assay development and evaluation employing clinical material. First, the type of specimen (or specimens) acceptable for assaying by PCR must be determined as well as the physical criteria for the specimen's (or specimens') suitability for analysis, including optimum source and volume, appropriate collection method, transport and storage conditions, and specimen longevity. The choice of specimen(s) plays a key role in the performance and interpretation of test results because if any of the criteria are not fulfilled, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay will vary accordingly (Noordhoek et al., 1996) . This becomes of paramount importance in quantitative amplification assays used to determine viral clearance such as for HCV (Van Vliet et al., 2001) . In general, plasma or serum is preferred over whole blood or leukocytes when the target organism is predominantly extracellular (e.g., HCV RNA, human immunodeficiency virus-1 RNA).",

There are numerous methods in the literature for extracting either DNA or RNA from clinical specimens; however, they are beyond the scope of this discussion. A host of commercially available kits are available from which to choose as well as a number of automated methods for specimen preparation. These commercially available kits and automated systems are advantageous over manual methods of extraction in that they are more rapid and cost-effective and provide more consistent results. Nevertheless, the most optimal method for extracting nucleic acid must also be determined for each specimen type. The volume of specimen to be used for extraction must be taken under consideration; sample volumes vary considerably depending on the amplification method, but most assays use between 100 and 250 [\u03bc]l. Lastly, the method for detection of the target must be selected. Again, numerous options are available, such as detection by agarose gel electrophoresis or hybridization capture assays employing the capture of a biotinylated amplicon by a target-specific probe and detection by streptavadin-horseradish peroxidase etc.",

Nucleic acid amplifications have become crucial in the diagnosis of selected infectious disease agents. Initially, molecular diagnostic tests were performed only in highly specialized or research laboratories; however, these assays are now more widely performed in all sections of the clinical laboratory. This has been largely a result of commercial assays, such as those advocated by the Food and Drug Administration, having been introduced into the market. Clearly, as the technology advances, additional commercial, Food and Drug Administration-approved methods will become available and enable even the smallest laboratory to employ amplification technologies for the detection of microorganisms. Nevertheless, in the meantime, there is a significant demand for amplification assays to detect the presence of a variety of microorganisms in clinical specimens for which there are no commercially available kits. Thus, clinical laboratories, particularly those associated with academic medical centers, must frequently develop their own \"inhouse\" assays to accommodate the demand for the laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases by amplification methods.",

For example, studies have demonstrated that there is significant variation in the ability of \"home-brew\" or in-house assays among clinical laboratories to reliably detect infectious agents. Moreover, as studies are published that correlate clinical findings with results of amplification tests, it has become exceedingly evident that although molecular diagnostic assays enhance diagnostic capabilities, their results must be clearly interpreted within the clinical context and performance of the laboratory assay. In other words, a thorough understanding of the parameters of the molecular assay, including the respective procedural limitations and the target organism's microbiology and pathogenesis, is critical for the proper interpretation of results. Clearly, ongoing clinical research to correlate amplification results with clinical findings as well as strict adherence to guidelines for method validation for in-house PCR assays are prerequisite.",

Not only are there costs for reagents and equipment, but there are also training costs associated with teaching microbiologists to perform these molecular diagnostic assays. Through rapid diagnosis, more expensive and/or invasive procedures may be prevented, hospital stays shortened, or the unnecessary administration of antibiotics prevented. Presently, in light of the expense of these assays coupled with an ever-increasing demand for testing as the list of clinical syndromes increases for some infectious agents, the appropriate use of these assays is imperative. Studies centering on the use of molecular assays in terms of cost and other benefits are now being published. More of these types of studies need to be performed so that the appropriate use of molecular assays is accomplished.",

Mixed viral and bacterial infections can also be daunting tasks for diagnosis and therapy, but if the molecular tests developed not only delineate all that is present (signals) but also differentiate what is responsible for illness in the host (sensors), then we will be at a true crossroads in the treatment of infectious diseases. Dunne et al. (2002) described a future scenario where this testing develops as we envisage here, and postulated that by the year 2025 sophisticated samplers will painlessly obtain the necessary material, followed by automated analysers to process simultaneously DNA, RNA, protein, glycopeptides and exopolysaccharides to detect any of a possible 168 pathogenic microbes as well as toxins and resistance genotypes, all completed and yielding a diagnosis within 15 min. We believe this future is attainable even earlier, and that bringing these advances to fruition is critical for mastering antimicrobial agent prescribing in order to manage their use in a rational way and finally reverse the increasing resistance that threatens these precious agents we have as necessary aids to all our health. The technology and vision are here, we just need the will to do it.",
