The numbers of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 are escalating daily, putting health care systems worldwide under tremendous pressure. Policymakers in the affected countries have adopted varying strategies to deal with this crisis. As a result, the current COVID-19 status in terms of number of cases and deaths hugely varies between countries. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have managed to limit the massive spread of the infection among their populations by implementing proactive plans and timely decisions in response to COVID-19 outbreak; measures taken included suspension of flights, closure of educational institutes, curfew and lockdown of major cities, and provision of free-of-charge healthcare to patients. These countries implemented a wide range of control measures and management practices even prior to detecting local infections. So far, these continuing sustained efforts and unprecedented decisions have been key to limiting the spread of infection. Continuous monitoring and reporting of cases and deaths over the next several months is of a critical importance for the comprehensive evaluation of COVID-19 status and implementation of appropriate precautions in the GCC countries.",

These cases were either Iranians or citizens of the GCC countries who had recently visited Iran. Many citizens and residents of the GCC countries visit Iran frequently for religious and personal purposes. Iran reported the country's first case of COVID-19 on 19 February 2020 [5] . Since then, Iran has become among the countries most severely affected by COVID-19 with over 122,000 cases and more than 7,000 deaths (as of 18 May 2020) [5] . As soon as the GCC countries reported confirmed cases, Saudi Arabia initiated control measure and management practices (e.g., suspension of Umrah, tourism, and some international flights). Despite these restrictions, Saudi Arabia announced the country's first case of COVID-19 on 2 March 2020 [9] . As with the other GCC countries, this case was linked to a recent visit to Iran [9] . Subsequently, an increasing number of cases has been reported in the GCC countries ( Figure  1 ).",

Hence, there remain the possibility of under-estimation of the total number of cases in the GCC countries as well as in other countries worldwide [10] . However, the overall status of COVID-19 in GCC countries in comparison to many countries around the world are relatively stable so far. It indicates that control measures and management plans implemented by the GCC countries have successfully limited the spread of infection, despite risk factors for COVID-19 such as smoking, diabetes and cardiovascular disease being common in these countries [11] [12] [13] . Although it is far too early to draw any firm conclusion at this stage, other factors that might have contributed to the reduced number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the GCC countries are the high rates of Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination (given as part of the routine vaccination schedule in GCC countries) in addition to the high temperatures in these areas. These two factors were recently found to be inversely correlated with COVID-19 infectivity, morbidity, and mortality [14, 15] .",

Moreover, policymakers decided to provide medical care to all COVID-19 patients free of charge. This was followed by the closure of school and universities, sterilization campaigns, suspension of flights from and to the country, and curfew. Notably, the UAE has launched more than 10 coronavirus drive-through testing sites [16] .",

A few days later, the suspension of flights to and from China was announced. This was followed by the suspension of flights to more than 20 COVID-19-hit countries [17] . By the end of February, Saudi Arabia had also suspended Umrah (the 'minor pilgrimage to Mecca' required at least once in the lifetime of Muslims that can be undertaken at anytime of the year) for people from outside the country [18] . All of these were proactive control measures taken by Saudi Arabia even prior to detecting the first case in the country. Complete lockdown of the Holy Mosques was enforced on 5 March 2020, only three days following confirmation of the first COVID-19 case in the country. This was a huge step by the government given the number of daily visitors to the Holy Mosques which is estimated to be more than 278.000 visitors per hour [19] . During March 2020, policymakers took a series of further decisions including mosque and educational institute closures, activation of distance learning, restriction on restaurants and shopping centers, suspension of flights to many countries including other GCC and European Union countries, this was followed by suspension of all international flights, and lockdown of major cities (Makkah, Madinah, Riyadh, and Jeddah) with curfew from 3 pm to 6 am [17] . Despite all of these control measures, the number of cases continued to escalate (Figure 1 ). In response, a 24-hour curfew was imposed in 11 cities by the first week of April. It should also be noted that the Ministry of Health, and many universities and research institutes in Saudi Arabia have announced the availability of grant funds for COVID-19 research during the last couple of months. One of the main achievements of these studies was the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 for the first time in Saudi Arabia by the Special Infectious Agent Unit (SIAU) at King Abdulaziz University on 7 April 2020.",

These measures include lockdown of major cities, full suspension of flights, university and school closure, banning of social gathering and sport events, provision of free-of-charge healthcare to patients, and launching of COVID-19 active screening ( Figure 2 ). By implementing these proactive and reactive responses in relation to the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, it may be concluded that health and governmental officials of the GCC countries have generally succeeded in bringing the outbreak under control in their countries. However, without cooperation from the public, it would have not been possible to contain the infection. Multiple awareness campaigns in different languages are in progress through various forms of media to increase public awareness about COVID-19 infection and provideup-to-date information on new cases, deaths, and recoveries. Although several incidences of careless acts and violation of curfew laws have been reported, the governments' efforts to raise awareness continue. The challenges remain as we are in the holy month of Ramadan and approaching Eid (from 23 April to 23 May 2020): two special occasions for Muslims who represent the vast majority of population in the GCC countries. It is very common for people to gather frequently in large groups in homes and mosques during Ramadan and Eid. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah and Guidance in Saudi Arabia has announced that mosques are to remain closed during Ramadan, which is the case in other GCC countries.",
