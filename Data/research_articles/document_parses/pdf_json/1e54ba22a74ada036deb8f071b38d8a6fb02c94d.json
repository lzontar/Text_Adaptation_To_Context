Evidence Review: Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp\u00ae Drug Interactions, (b) Micromedex\u00ae Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c) Liverpool \u00d3 Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. To acquire more information on QT prolongation and TdP, the CredibleMeds\u00ae QTDrugs List was searched. Based on the information collected, the authors made a recommendation agreed to by consensus. In addition, a systematic review was conducted to find the clinical outcomes of drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics Results: The main interaction between COVID-19 drugs and antipsychotics are the risk of QT prolongation and TdP, and CYP interactions.
