Moreover, these symptoms are typical of the early stages of the disease generally occurring two days after the onset of the fever. In 15.3% of patients, temporary taste and / or smell disturbances were the only manifestation of COVID-19. Secondly, the reduction of taste and smell spontaneously regressed in a few days in 67.5% of cases. However, on functional tests, these patients had an increase in the sensory threshold while the discriminative ability was fully recovered.",

In patients in whom the alteration of taste and smell lasts more than 10 days, the risk of developing a severe pulmonary clinical picture was 2.4 times greater. These preliminary results could have important pathogenetic and clinical implications. The detection of sudden chemosensitive dysfunction, typically not associated with nasal obstruction or rhinitis symptoms, is highly suspicious of an ongoing COVID-19 infection. The tendency to spontaneous regression of these disorders, associated with the relative frequency of manifestations related to an involvement of the central nervous system, could suggest that the virus has non-neuronal 5 targets rather than a pathogenesis linked to neuronal death induced in the olfactory bulb. Prospective follow-up of these patients and histopathological analysis of samples from patients who have died from COVID-19 will help us better understand the pathogenetic mechanisms that underlie these disorders. Finally, the correlation between the duration of chemosensitive disorders and the severity of the disease would suggest that there may be a relationship between the persistence of viral multiplication in the upper airways and the severity of the disease. However, to confirm this hypothesis, studies will be needed to correlate the symptomatic picture to the viral load in seriate rhino-pharyngeal swabs.",
