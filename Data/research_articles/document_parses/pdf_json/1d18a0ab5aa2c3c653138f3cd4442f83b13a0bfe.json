Among the different COVID? wards, we have to distinguish the intensive care unit and lower-intensity COVID? wards. In the former, we have implemented maximum protective measures that allow the resuscitator to pass from one patient to another without changing too many items, while using the major PPE (gown, mask) for several hours, being mindful that changing clothes continuously could increase contagiousness. In the latter, only the most exposed staff (in direct contact with the patient) use maximum protective measures.

Other hospitals have registered an increase in emergency operation, in contrary to our experience. The rationale for this difference, in our view, can be primarily explained by the fact that we are not a trauma center. At the same time, when possible we chose to treat in a more conservative way some surgical problems that usually may have been treated in a more direct and urgent surgical way, with the aim to limit the use of specialist staff and operating theater. This approach may be considered unfair because, even if we are living in an extraordinary contest, we do not have to miss good practice from guidelines and evidence-based medicine [7] . We underline that none of these decisions have been taken at the risk of reducing our patients' chance of survival, and we have always discussed cases in interdisciplinary meetings. We would like to remark the importance of making choices (medical, ethical and practical) to correctly use our mean to help patients with higher survival rates, especially in this historic time.",

Starting from 900 ICU beds in Lombardy, 600 additional ICU beds have been added for SARS-CoV2 patients. All of them have been occupied during the full emergency. We used two scores (ASA score and NSQIP-ACS Surgical Risk Calculator) to stratify the real necessity of ICU after surgery, considering perioperative ''real risk'' for those patients with predicted intensive care need. According to this approach, we established two principal classes: patients who really need ICU, whose surgery has been postponed according to ICU availability, and those for whom ICU is not a real necessity, whose a clinical close monitoring was sufficing for. During the whole all SARS-CoV2 emergency, we managed to have two postsurgical ICU beds available for really emergent or unexpected surgery patients, who could not be immediately readmitted to surgical ward. Starting from the evidence that many of these patients have been discharged from operating room without ICU without any particular problems, it is possible to consider that after the COVID emergency, anesthesiological preoperative indication might be modified.",

After multidisciplinary meeting, we decided to perform a two-stage hepatectomy (TSH) as follows: First step, open left colectomy, S3 metastasectomy and right portal vein ligation; second step, open right hepatectomy. The estimated liver volumetry at first evaluation was 28%. The first step was performed on February 6, and postoperative course was complicated by nosocomial pneumonia. Histological examination confirmed colic cancer with hepatic secondary lesion in S3 (ypT3, ypN0, ypM1a). After 3 weeks from the discharge, we evaluated a new liver volumetry, which resulted in 36%, good enough to perform the second stage. However, according to anesthesiologist, the patient needed intensive care assistance following surgery and, at the same time, we were first experiencing COVID-19 emergent (first decade of March 2020). Considering these statements and patient's general delicate conditions, after comprehensive examination according to anesthesiologist and medical oncologist, we decided not to operate. On March 31, the patient started new chemotherapy course (Cetuximab) still underway and well tolerated. Our program is to proceed with medical therapies as long as we can perform the second stage with ICU assistance, as planned before.",

We did not choose emergent operation despite clinical and radiological signs of occlusion, to avoid ICU recovery after surgery and to limit surgical and anesthesiological complications. In particular, this patient could be a candidate for temporary or definitive ileostomy or colostomy, a risky condition for elderly patient especially facing summer, not least chemotherapy. Medical and conservative treatment was started (intravenous hydration, nasogastric tube, electrolytes abnormalities correction), while complete preoperative examinations were performed with the aim to operate him as soon as possible in the best conditions. We performed a colonoscopy to see eventually other lesions and to place an endoscopic stent as bridge to surgery. Even if he was a really old patient, considering that he had no comorbidities and according to his relatives, we decide to perform delayed urgent surgery, without a fast-track postoperative protocol. Also thanks to the stenting procedure, we could perform an open left colectomy with end-to-end anastomosis without any stoma.

Nevertheless, operation timing coincided with the major pandemic diffusion and a laparoscopic approach was risky, as said before. At the end, considering tumor position and risk-benefits ratio (optimal treatment vs possible COVID contagion) we had a new multidisciplinary meeting. According to Barcelona criteria (BCLC), thermoablation therapy was the correct choice but better through laparoscopy; the percutaneous approach can be considered the second choice, but in this case, it was probably the best one.

Unfortunately, for relapse of symptoms (fever and abdominal pain) the patient came back to ER only 2 weeks later. A new CT scan documented a relapse of the intra-abdominal abscess. Considering the history of the patient, an urgent surgical approach to the problem should be considered as the first choice. Since the involvement in the abscess of abdominal fascia and subcutaneous tissues, a high risk of postsurgical infection and/ or dehiscence of abdominal wall was estimated, plus ICU recovery needed. For these reasons, we chose a conservative treatment through a new percutaneous drainage placement. Evaluation of nutritional status was done recognizing an important malnutrition state (MUST 2). Therefore, the patient was supported with parenteral nutrition (about 1600 kcal/die) and vitamins. Finally, the patient underwent elective surgical laparotomy intervention with intra-operative diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor of the sigmoid colon complicated by fistula and abscess. Left side colectomy with anastomosis was performed. Postoperative period was regular. In this case, conservative approach as the first step allowed to limit surgical risks, to upgrade nutritional assessment that was inadequate at the admission and to manage sepsis and general status avoiding ICU recovery after surgery.",
