Nevertheless, the patient improved due to prone ventilation and was extubated on the seventh day of admission. COVID-19 can lead to development of a hypercoagulopathy that may not be seen with conventional tests of coagulation, but can be detected through ROTEM. Thus, robust anticoagulant therapy might be needed to prevent thrombotic complications in a particular subset of COVID-19 patients. Alexander et al. conducted a study that involved patients who developed thrombotic complications after major abdominal surgeries 4 . Upon ROTEM testing, these patients exhibited a mean CFT in FIBTEM of 378.9 s while the CFT in our patient was 54 s.The CFT in FIBTEM cannot be measured in a healthy person's blood because the FIBTEM includes cytochalasin D, which strongly inhibits the function of platelets and polymerization of fibrinogen. However, the FIBTEM column confirmed that our patient was in a hypercoagulable state. VHA screening may be necessary for COVID-19patients.
