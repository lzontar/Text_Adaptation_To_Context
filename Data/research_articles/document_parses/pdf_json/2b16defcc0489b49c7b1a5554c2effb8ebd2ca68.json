To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV-1 virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003. Thus, there remains an urgent need for the identification and development of specific antiviral therapeutics to conquer SARS-CoV-2. To conquer viral infections, the inhibition of proteases essential for proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy. In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 606 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2. A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors has not been reported before. After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of molecular descriptors relevant for pharmacokinetics to narrow down the number of initial hits. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies. After evaluation of off-target binding, we report a list of 12 purchasable compounds, with binding affinity to the target protease that is predicted to be more favorable than that of the cocrystallized peptidomimetic compound. In order to quickly advise ongoing therapeutic intervention for patients, we evaluated approved antiviral drugs and other protease inhibitors to provide a list of 9 compounds for drug repurposing. Furthermore, we identified the natural compounds (-)-taxifolin and rhamnetin as potential inhibitors of M pro . Rhamnetin is already commercially available in pharmacies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Supporting Results and Discussion Virtual Screening Procedures: Figures S1-S5, Tables S1-S3, Pharmacokinetic parameters 2 Final Selection of Compounds: Figures S6-S8 , Tables S4-S6 11 Supporting Materials and Methods Docking and shape screening: Table S7 13", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 165, "text": "Figures S6-S8", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 168, "end": 180, "text": "Tables S4-S6", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 246, "end": 254, "text": "Table S7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Table of Contents"}, {"text": "Supporting References 13", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Table of Contents"}, {"text": "Virtual screening procedures Figure S1 .

Due to our selection criterion for extracting compounds from the ZINC database, drug-likeness with respect to molecular weight (MW) was guaranteed. Several compounds, however, violated commonly accepted criteria such as the distribution coefficient logD and polar surface area (PSA). Those compounds were eliminated from further consideration. Due to the catalytic function of the target enzyme, peptides and peptidomimetics are widely applied in targeting proteases. 1 Nonetheless, disadvantages of peptides or peptidomimetics include limited oral bioavailability due to their large MW, PSA, and high number of rotatable bonds as well as poor metabolic stability and higher production cost. 2 Therefore, the development of small-molecules with balanced and favorable pharmacokinetic properties facilitating oral absorption offers a promising alternative. The lowest RMSD of the cocrystallized ligands compared to all five ensemble structures is reported. Crystal structures lacking the standard PDB notation were derived from the diamond webpage. 3 The cocrystallized ligand N3 (PDB ID 6LU7) was docked with the smina docking protocol to one of the ensemble structures. The binding modes were assessed for the MD frame with lowest binding free energy according to MM/GBSA post-processing.
