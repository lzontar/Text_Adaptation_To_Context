The appearance of coronaviruses was likened to that of some ornate crowns, the Latin for which is corona, and the corona of the sun, that also being derived from the Latin for crown, so corona was adopted for the name of this virus group. Toroviruses also derived their name from a Latin root, this time from torus, a semi-circular moulding such as is found at the base of a column. This name was chosen to reflect the appearance of the internal component of the virus which is torus-or doughnut-shaped (arrow). Some torovirus particles may appear rod-shaped (double arrowhead). Coronaviruses have a surface spike layer (20 nm) that may be more prominent than that of toroviruses. The shorter, 10 nm, projections on the torovirus particles in these pictures may be the haemagglutinin esterase protein rather than the spike protein which may be largely absent.

There appear to be more constraints on the sequence of the S2 polypeptide, this polypeptide being involved in anchoring the protein in the membrane, forming the coiled-coil multimeric mature S protein and activating membrane fusion. By contrast, the function of the S1 subunit would seem to be limited to providing a receptor-binding domain.

Notwithstanding, the S protein can be a major determinant of pathogenicity. Ballesteros et al. [174] produced recombinants from enteropathogenic and non-enteropathogenic strains of TGEV which had extremely similar genome sequences. Some of the recombinants were non-enteropathogenic, the authors concluding that only one or two amino acid differences in the S protein were associated with the nonenteropathogenic phenotype. The authors produced further support for the role of the S protein in enteropathogenicity by producing recombinant TGEV by targeted recombination [230] . They further suggested that two domains on the S protein might be involved in attachment to enteric cells, one for binding to porcine aminopeptidase N. This receptor is present in lung tissue as well as in enteric tissue; binding to this does not account for the different tropisms. The other domain might be involved in the binding to a coreceptor, not defined, essential for the enteric tropism; differences in this domain affected the tropism of TGEV.
