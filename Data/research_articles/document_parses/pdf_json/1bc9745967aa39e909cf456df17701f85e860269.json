If decision cannot be made they go for a medical examination/ Social insurance also available but low for PWD -sometimes geographical inaccessibility for UCT assessment Viet Nam To explore participation in disability targeted and non-targeted social protection programmes in Viet Nam Rural populations who are informally employed are not protected by social security. People with injuries were exposed to lengthy judicial processes and were challenged by for-profit sectors. Disabled workers are left unprotected and unable to work. Low rate of coverage 32/5% of the workforce. Many do not know if they are affiliated. One must be severely disabled in order to receive any benefits. People believed that they received unfair assessments and were frustrated by bureaucracy. Led to a lengthily process in accessing work-related benefits. Heath system is fragmented from social security and employment related health and disability do not work cohesvively together. Companies are the winner whereas injured or disabled workers struggle to get social security Cash transfers can be divided into those that seek to mimic benefits of social insurance and those that promote positivist behaviours (CCTs). Security or insurance against disability and sickness is not guaranteed -subsidised insurance programmes are available but enrolment is low amongst informal workers. ",

Discusses reform -reforms are being planned to reduce dependency from claimants but risk reducing coverage and increase income vulnerability for disabled people. Ultimately, people don't have a choice but to depend on BCP when they do not make an income great enough to contribute towards social insurance. BCP therefore was not found to be a disincentive for social insurance enrolment but a necessity -the option to choose was not available. ",

Supplemental micro saving programmes for this gourd should also be considered by government and private sector to help protect households against shocks. Informal workers do not have access to work-related social security and face higher work related risks. Poorer informal workers are ill-placed to make use of possible preventative interventions that may lead to income loss in the short term. Needs to be a more inclusive approach that improves occupational health and safety and expand social protection to all workers and not just to those in poverty. Ultimately all citizens should have the same entitlements. Discusses alliances in health with networks from civil society groups including people with disabilities, farmers, indigenous people and other vulnerable groups -Whilst people may have access to insurance to cover for contingency such as injury or disease, preventative, promotive and curative steps are unaddressed (need to add protective and preventive functions to social security) Social protection policy framework approved in 2016. 5 pillars -social safety net (cash transfer); social insurance (including disability pension); labour market programmes and labour regulation improvement; livelihood support; social support. However only 20% of labour force covered by social security. 40% programmes supported by NGOs. Criticism -fragmented without proper structure, exclusionary systems, lack of consistency and transparency, lack of coordination between government agencies and disjointed approaches with multiple streams. People with disabilities are more likely to be in informal work or have periods of no work/ inability to continue doing the same work or make them permanently unemployable. People in the informal economy face greater risk than those in the formal economy -they are more likely to be poor, work in unhealthy environments and more likely to lose their income because of illness and more likely to suffer from a disability. They may have turned to informal work because they became unemployed. They need more social protection than the formal sector but they have less of it.",

UCTs are inherently political and serve government intersts.Contributory social protection has been expanded to the informal sector. UHC has improved through contributive regime (CR) and subsidised regime (SR). Only people who use SR are able to get sick leave, and are otherwise only entitled to UHC Sri Lanka only covers disabled soldiers -has safety nets as a last resort but they are poorly targeted with low level benefits. In Pakistan and Nepal there is no efficient harmonised framework. Uzbekistan has unemployment and poverty benefits -no more elaboration Costa Rica has universal policies (social security) and targeted policies.

Illness and accident insurance have recently expanded to cover rural areas in Brazil.Half labour force are in informal economy and cannot benefit from social security. even those who are covered only receive half of minimum wage. Usage of policies is not widespread. Difficult to qualify for insurance and the insurance will only provide half of the minimum wage.

Problematic because sick and disabled people may need things like cars to help manage their disability yet become ineligible because of it.Having a long term labour contract improved migrant workers social insurance coverage.

Barriers for women -more likely to need it because higher STis HIV. GBV/IPV stops women accessing it. Also lack of identification documents, inability to pay transport and administrative fees, illiteracy and ignorance on what they are entitled to. Women more danger when traveling along and have child care responsibility. Panels are also badly organised Programmes in a number of countries but there are exclusions i.e. people with autism in India are ineligible. Barriers include low funding levels, complex administrative systems, physically inaccessible; long journeys; limited awareness; conditions attached to transfers; ideological and technical administrative hurdles. Design of programmes can act as barriers. Advocates for embedding transfers within wider framework against discrimination against PWD to aid empowerment. People get sick naturally after losing their grant because they fall back into poverty and become malnourished. Social capital greatly influences outcomes. Grant can improve household nutrition but trade off between healthcare costs and household costs Cash transfers combined with UHC helped build resilience among some household. However, those without access to at least both of these things were more likely to be impoverished owing to the direct and indirect costs of having a long term illness.

Calls for chronic illness grant so people can stay on it after AIDs recovery but is seen as unaffordable Limited coverage for very poor; implementation frameworks is unclear, high exclusion for PWD owing to restrictive targeting criteria. Suggests designing specific policy for disabled people. Issues include: unclear graduation expectations (what happens when you 'graduate' out of poverty/illness); programme fragmented on a national level; capacity of institutions i.e. inadequate resources and staff; heavy reliance on community volunteers raising concerns about reliability and effectiveness; delays in payments; difficulties in financing.Improve coordination between public work interventions and districts; nee to improve resilience and income so less need for these programmes. Improve microfinance access to the poor; includes shocksensitivity in the design to target acute and sudden events.UCTsThere are fully disabled and partially disabled allowances but not nationally -only in certain parts of the country. Lack of clarity policies regarding social security programmes , especially in determining state accountability and there is limited manpower. Local bodies are not enthusiastic in implementing programmes due to administrative expenses. Some of the assessment protocols were unclear or confusing, especially the classification of disabilities. Disabled people are found to be less aware of their access to help. 80% respondents said allowance was insufficient in meeting personal household expenditure. Physically disabled destitute persons above the age of 45 can get a disability pension. Allowance depends on level of disability.People with disabilities did have strong household support but faced financial difficulties in living with a disability. Disabled people more likely to be involved in precarious employment. Only 10% of PWD said they received a disability grant. Policymakers need to understand potential disabling effects of illness, particularly chronic conditions.",

PWD are not political priorities so finance is reduced. Grant cannot cover full needs of PWD and certainly does not expand to household need.

Acknowledges that people with disabilities have their own needs and tailored programmes to avoid exclusion. Benefitsincrease dignity, power and autonomy for survival and recovery, maintain peoples financial inclusion during conflict. But must take into account the nature of conflict and be flexible All programmes aim to reduce poverty and vulnerability. There are important differences between social transfer programmes in middle income countries and those in low income countries. On the whole, middle income countries have greater financial, administrative and research capacity to implement social transfer programmes to scale. In low income countries, on the other hand, the extension of social protection has been slower, programmes institutionalisation has been more precarious, and sustainability issues are important. In low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and lower middle income countries in Central America, programmes tend to be of fixed term, small scale and at the pilot stage Domestic workers were not well recognised or protected by Thai labour law.
