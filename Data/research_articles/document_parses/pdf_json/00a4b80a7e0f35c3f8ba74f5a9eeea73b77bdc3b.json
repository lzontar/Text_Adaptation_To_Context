Province, China. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a public health emergency of international significance on 30 January 2020 1 and classified the threat as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 2 . More than 6 million confirmed cases and 371,166 deaths have been reported from more than 200 countries and territories as of 2 June 2020 3 . On 23 January 2020, China raised the national emergency response to the highest level, which triggered an unprecedented travel ban starting from the lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January, and 14 cities in Hubei Province on 24 January, and more than 30 provinces thereafter. Despite this unprecedented intervention, we estimated that COVID-19 cases had been introduced into 130 (95% CrI: 190, 369) cities in mainland China prior to the lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January 2020 4 . Similar findings on the rapid geographic expansion of COVID-19", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "Lloyd-Smith et al 17 , we defined the threshold of observing super-spreading events (SSE) as the 99percentile of the offspring distribution for the number of secondary cases caused by a primary case. Household and non-household transmissions were combined together for computing the offspring distribution. To estimate the threshold of observing SSE, we used a Poisson, exponential, and power-law distribution to fit the empirical offspring distribution via the Distribution Fitter App in Matlab R2020a 18 . Since the power-law distribution gives the smallest Akaike information criterion (AIC) compared to the Poisson and exponential distributions (Supplementary Table 2), the threshold of observing SSE is set as 3.78, which indicates the occurrence of an SSE if 4 or more secondary cases were infected by a single primary case. For each transmission pair with known symptom onset times for both primary and secondary cases, we computed the empirical serial interval as the number of days between the symptom onset dates of the primary case and of the secondary case 19 . Due to the presence of negative-valued serial intervals and the skewness of the empirical distribution (Figure 1b), we estimated the serial interval distributions by fitting a normal distribution via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with Gibbs sampling and non-informative flat prior. We confirmed the convergence of MCMC chains via trace plot and diagnosis, and obtained the posterior estimates of parameters by running 100,000 iterations with a burn-in of 40,000 iterations and a thinning interval of 10. Fitting serial intervals data with a Gumbel or Logistic distribution gives similar estimates (Supplementary Tables 3 -5).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "findings and conclusions in this manuscript are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche, European Commission, European Research Council, National Institutes of Health, National Natural Science Foundation and National Social Science Foundation of China, and the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

See Supplementary Table 3 for more results. Notably, 25 of 339 household-and 25 of 340 non-household transmission pairs reported negative-valued serial intervals, implying pre-symptomatic transmission. We performed several sensitivity analysis on estimating serial interval distributions (Supplementary Tables 4 -5), such as the stratification of transmission pairs by the location of primary cases (imported versus local), and estimating transmission pairs with more clear epidemiological evidence (e.g., primary case linked only to a single secondary case). Results of these sensitivity analysis are consistent with those estimated with all transmission pairs.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": ", children (<18) never acquired COVID-19 from other children at home may be more a reflection of the usual household composition in Chinese cities (single child living with parents) than the transmission characteristics of the virus.
