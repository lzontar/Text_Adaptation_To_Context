Pathogens of HIV related pulmonary infections include parasites, fungi, mycobacteria, viruses, bacteria and toxoplasma gondii. According to international reports, pathogens have different geographical distribution, which is also closely related to the socioeconomic status of the region to produce varied AIDS related diseases spectra. For instance, in the United States, pneumocystis carnii pneumonia (PCP), tuberculosis and recurrent bacterial pneumonia (at least twice within 1 year) occur frequently in HIV infected patients. An international report published 10 years ago indicated that PCP is the most common and serious pulmonary opportunistic infections in HIV infected patients. Now its incidence has dropped with the application of antiretroviral treatment and preventive measures. PCP will continue to occur initially in patients who are aware of their HIV infection. In addition, HIV related viral and parasitic infections have been reported both domestically and internationally. In this section, the clinical manifestations and imaging fi ndings of HIV related pulmonary infections are analyzed and discussed, which provide effective diagnosis basis, so as to reduce the incidence of HIV-related pulmonary infections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Pneumocystis has been believed to be a kind of protozoon. Recently, based on its ultrastructure and ribosomal RNA phylogenetic analysis, pneumocystis is now believed to be a kind of fungus, with high affi nity to the lung tissues. Due to the compromised immunity, 95 % AIDS patients sustain different types of pulmonary infections, of which PCP is the most common life-threatening opportunistic infection with an incidence rate of about 60-85 %. About 90-95 % patients suffering from AIDS complicated by PCP are adolescents and adults with their CD4 T cell counts being less than 200/ \u03bcl. Clinical manifestations of typical PCP are fever, cough (dry cough without phlegm), dyspnea, chest distress and shortness of breath. Dyspnea is shown as progressive difficulty in breathing, which initially occurs after physical activities and develops into diffi culty breathing even in resting state. PCP is commonly accompanied by weight loss, fatigue, anemia, general upset and lymphadenectasis. All these symptoms are non-specifi c, but patients often report subjective feelings of severe symptoms while physical signs are mild. By auscultation, the lungs are normal or with slightly dry, moist rales. These are the clinical fi ndings characteristic to AIDS complicated by PCP. In most patients with PCP, the serum LDH level increases but it is non-specifi c. In cases of AIDS complicated by PCP, the blood PO2 reduces, commonly being lower than 70 mmHg in patients in the middle and advanced stages. The diagnostic imaging for PCP includes chest X-ray and CT scanning. Due to the low resolution of chest X-ray, its demonstrations are negative for PCP patients in the early stage or only include thickened pulmonary markings and decreased pulmonary transparency. However, CT scanning demonstrates tiny lesions or more detailed changes in lungs. Especially with the application of HRCT, the detection rate of PCP lesions has been greatly improved. It has been internationally reported that nearly 10 % of PCP patients show negative fi ndings by the chest X-ray but with abnormal fi ndings by HRCT. Due to the rapid progression of PCP as well as its complex pathological changes, CT scanning demonstrations are diverse with specifi city. According to different pulmonary CT scanning demonstrations in different stages of the illness, PCP is divided into early stage (exudative and infi ltrative stage), middle stage (fusion and parenchymal stage) and advanced stage (absorption or fi brosis stage). The early typical manifestations include intrapulmonary multiple miliary nodules, mainly distributed in both middle and lower lung fi elds. It may be accompanied by enlarged hilar shadow, which should be differentiated from acute miliary tuberculosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pneumocystis Carnii Pneumonia"}, {"text": "The middle stage is a period of infi ltration. As the disease progresses, miliary and patchy shadows fuse and expand into a dense infi ltrative shadow with even density, showing a diffuse ground glass liked change. The typical manifestations include bilaterally symmetric foci with the hilus as the center. The foci infi ltrates from the hilus to bilateral pulmonary interstitium, progressing from the both middle lungs to both lower lungs. HRCT can more clearly demonstrate the foci, showing a map liked or gravel road liked appearance, with clearly demonstration of gas containing bronchus penetrating the foci. The pulmonary apex is involved later.

The autopsy grossly demonstrates swelling of the lung tissue, and the alveoli are fi lled with large quantity foamy liquid. The pathological changes mainly manifested as interstitial pneumonia, with early manifestations of increased permeability of the capillary wall basement membrane in the alveolar walls, which leads to fl uid exudation. The Pneumocystis carinii proliferate in large quantity and adhere to cause degeneration of the type I alveolar epithelial cells and shedding of the basement membrane.

In the cases with aspergillus infection, hyphae can be found in the sputum. Fungal infections often occur in patients with CD4 T cell count below 100/\u03bcl, of which the most common pulmonary infection is aspergillus infection, followed by penicillium marneffei infection. Pulmonary infections caused by Candida albicans and histoplasma are rarely found. The incidence of cryptococcal pulmonary infection is still in a disagreement, which is increasing recently. There are also some common endemic fungal infections, such as the most commonly found fungal infections of AIDS complicated by penicillium infections in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Hong Kong, China. Aspergillus has an extensive existence in the natural world. AIDS complicated by aspergillus infection is related to the application of corticosteroid hormone or broad-spectrum antibiotics, which occurs commonly in the advanced/critical stage of AIDS. The cases of pulmonary fungal infections, with fi ndings of hyphae (aspergillus or candida) or yeast in cytoplasm (Histoplasma capsulatum) in tissue sections and simultaneous fi ndings of histiocytic reactions including the infi ltration of neutrophilic granulocyte and the necrosis of histocytes, can be diagnosed as having invasive fungal infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fungal Infections"}, {"text": "Candida albicans is yeast liked fungus, which is widespread in the natural world. It can parasitize in the mocous of skin, oral cavity, intestinal tract and vagina of the human being. Candida albicans cannot cause disease in immunocompetent people but is pathogenic in immunocompromised population. After its invasion into the tissues, it turns into mycelia and multiplies in large quantity with great toxicity. It also has the ability to fi ght against phagocytosis. Clinically, its infection is characterized by a chronic onset and clinical symptoms of low and moderate grade fever but rarely high fever, cough, shortness of breath, cyanosis, irritation or dysphoria. The pulmonary signs include weakened breathing sounds by auscultation and obvious moist rales of lungs. The serious cases may have symptoms of systemic poisoning. The illness is prolonged and repeated during its whole progression. By diagnostic imaging demonstrations, it can be divided into the following types: (1) Bronchitis type, with chest X-ray demonstrations of increased pulmonary markings in lower fi elds of both lungs; (2) Pneumonia type, commonly with accompanying extrapulmonary lesions. The lesions are mainly located in the middle and lower lung fi elds and lesions in the lower lung fi eld are more common. The apex is generally not involved. The lesions are recurring one after another. A small number of patients may sustain complications of exudative pleurisy. (3) Disseminated type, with miliary shadows, diffuse nodular shadows or multiple small abscesses. The lesions often involve the middle and lower lungs. Chest X-ray demonstrates thickened pulmonary markings and accompanying spots, small fl akes and large fl akes of parenchyma shadows, in manifestations of bronchial pneumonia. In some serious cases, the foci may fuse together and enlarge to involve the entire lobe. CT scanning demonstrates pulmonary nodules and few have ground glass liked changes of the lungs. Pathological changes include acute infl ammatory lesions in the lungs, alveolar exudation and infi ltration of monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils.

Granulomas may form, but in immunocompromised patients, it may cause disseminated histoplasmosis. When the CD4 T cell count in AIDS patients is less than 150/\u03bcl, histoplasma capsulatum infection of lungs may occur. Histoplasma capsulatum pneumonia has a higher incidence in South America, Africa and India. In the slight cases, the clinical manifestations are similar to symptoms of the cold, with low-grade fever, cough, and general upset. In the serious cases, there are symptoms of infl uenza, including chills, high fever, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue and poor appetite. In the cases of acute cavity, thin-walled cavity may form within a month. Complications may be pericarditis, arthritis, skin nodules, rash fi brous mediastinitis and mediastinal granuloma. Diagnostic imaging demonstrations are non-specifi c, with scattering pulmonary acinus exudation, multiple nodules in a diameter of about 3 mm with accompanying thickened septa, and formation of granulomas with accompanying calcifi cation.

It is estimated that each year in 1,000 HIV infected patients, 35-162 sustain active TB, and there is a great risk of active TB progressed from the latent tuberculosis infection. HIV infected patients with tuberculosis are commonly young and middle aged adults, with more male patients than female patients. Tuberculosis can occur at any stage of AIDS and at any level of CD4 T cell counts. It has been internationally reported that HIV infection complicated by TB has no specifi c imaging demonstrations. It has an acute onset, with an incidence of acute onset 2.5 times as high as that in non-HIV infected patients. The lesions are morphologically diverse, which are different from non-HIV infected patients with TB. HIV infection complicated by TB has commonly an acute onset, while TB in non-HIV infected patients is commonly secondary to other lesions, with cavities, fi brosis, pleural thickening and calcifi cation. A study conducted in China has demonstrated that for AIDS complicated by TB, the acute cases mainly have military and exudative lesions, with an incidence of 33 and 49 % respectively; while the incidence of chronic cases including cavity, fi brosis and calcifi cation is declining, being 11, 11 and 2 respectively. A later occurrence of tuberculosis in HIV infected patients indicates a more seriously immunocompromised immunity, with less typical clinical manifestations and imaging demonstrations. When the CD4 T cell count level is above 350-400/\u03bcl, the systemic symptoms are fever, chills, night sweating, fatigue, poor appetite and weight loss. Respiratory symptoms are cough, expectoration, hemoptysis, chest pain and dyspnea. It manifests as primary tuberculosis, with its foci distributing in the middle and lower lungs, involving multiple lobes and segments. When the CD4 T cell count decrease, the impact of TB increase including the occurrence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and disseminated disease. When the CD4 T cell count drops below 200/\u03bcl, pulmonary tuberculosis manifests as acute onset (such as miliary tuberculosis) or extrapulmonary tuberculosis (such as ileocecal tuberculosis) and peripheral lymph nodes tuberculosis. Its difference from the clinical manifestations of non-HIV infected patients is as the following: (1) More common pulmonary infi ltration with multiple involvements and rare cavities; (2) Higher incidence of dissemination (87-96 %) commonly along with blood fl ow and higher incidence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (60-70 %); (3) More common lymph node tuberculosis, such as hilar, mediastinal and extrapleural lymphadenectasis; (4) Lower positive rate of tuberculin test (PPD); (5) More patients with no expectoration, with sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli staining is negative; (6) Higher incidence of resistant strains, high recurrence rate, and higher mortality (Table 17 .1 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2633, "end": 2642, "text": "(87-96 %)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3080, "end": 3089, "text": "(Table 17", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Pulmonary Tuberculosis"}, {"text": "Foci in the cases with AIDS complicated by pulmonary tuberculosis are change quickly.

Many opportunistic pathogens can cause respiratory infections, including bacterial bronchitis, pneumonia and pleuritis. The incidence rate of bacterial pneumonia (BP) is 3-5 %. BP has a larger range of impact on HIV infected patients than on non-HIV infected groups. Repeated episode of BP is considered to be the fi rst manifestations of latent HIV infection. Therefore, for those individuals who have recurrent pneumonia without other risk factors, they should be alert to HIV infection. The common pathogenic bacteria include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Rhodococcus equi, Haemophilus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. As non-HIV infected patients, the most common pathogens of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus infl uenzae. Legionella and Klebsiella are also common. Many factors, such as the reduced T lymphocytes in HIV infected patients, manufacturing disorders of neutrophils, mononuclear cells and cytokines, and dysfunctional B lymphocytes, provide chances for opportunistic bacterial infections. In addition, the application of broad-spectrum antibiotics also increases the chance of opportunistic infections. BP can occur in any stage of HIV and at any level of CD4 T cell count.

Rhodococcus equi was initially discovered in 1923 and nominated as corynebacterium equi. After structure analysis of the cell wall, it was found to be different from Corynebacterium, and therefore it is classifi ed into Rhodococcus. Rhodococcus equi is generally considered as the pathogens of horses, pigs and cattle. Human rhodococcus equi infection is rare. But in recent years, due to an increase in patients with immunodefi ciency syndrome, reports of rhodococcus equi induced human respiratory infection and sepsis are increasing. Rhodococcus equi is an intracellular facultative parasitic bacterium. Its optimum temperature for growth is 30 \u00b0C, and suitable temperature for its growth is 10-40 \u00b0C. The acid-fast staining for rhodococcus equi shows uncertain results. Due to its various morphology, it is commonly mistaken as diphtheroids bacilli, Bacillus or Micrococcus. On sheep blood agar plate, the bacterium can have synergistic hemolysis with staphylococcus aureus, mononuclear Listeria and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. Toxicity mechanisms of Rhodococcus equi has been recently discovered the existence of toxic plasmid, which provides a new idea for the full understanding of its pathogenesis. Clinical symptoms are usually cough, orange red sputum, high fever and other symptoms. E Marchiori et al. in 2005 studied fi ve cases of AIDS complicated by Rhodococcus equi pulmonary infection.

CMV is the most common pathogen of HIV/AIDS related pulmonary infection. By autopsy, 49-82 % patients with HIV/AIDS have CMV infection, only second to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Moskowitz et al. [ 32 ] reported that among the direct causes of death in AIDS patients, 19 % is due to pulmonary cytomegalovirus infection. Because of the lack of typical clinical manifestations and sensitive examinations for its early diagnosis, the defi nitive diagnosis rate of cytomegalovirus pneumonia is only 13-24 % before autopsy. The clinical manifestations of CMV infection are non-specifi c. The systemic symptoms are fever, soreness of joints and muscles. Respiratory symptoms are paroxysmal dry cough, progressive shortness of breath, diffi culty in breathing during activities. Pulmonary CMV infection may develop secondary fungal infection or be complicated by bacterial, fungal, and Pneumocystis carinii infections. The cytomegalovirus can widely spread in the organs and tissues of the infected patients, and the infections can directly lead to the damage of infected host cells. In addition, the virus can also cause pathogenic effects via immune pathological mechanism. Some scholars classifi ed CMV pneumonia into diffuse, miliary necrosis and cytomegalic. Diffuse and cytomegalic CMV pneumonia are often accompanied by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which is more common in the diffuse type of CMV pneumonia but less common in cytomegalic type of CMV pneumonia. The pathological basis of diffuse small nodules in lungs is hemorrhagic necrosis. Sometimes CMV infection is concurrent with other infections in the lungs, and even co-infects one cell. Pulmonary parenchymal changes indicate bacterial and fungal infections, such as fi ndings of inclusion bodies in the cells, commonly known as Eagle's Eye sign.

The thickness of the nucleocapsid is about 100 nm, which is composed of 162 capsomeres. The nucleocapsid contains the core of the virus DNA. The virion gains the phospholipid rich viral envelope when it passes through the nuclear envelope. The nucleocapsid gemmates after it passes through the nuclear membrane and is released to the cell surface. The nucleocapsid can also be released outside the cells or gains its access into the neighbour cells for further reproduction. Herpes simplex virus replicates itself in the cell nucleus to produce histopathologic changes of herpes virus replication, with visible Cowdry A type intranuclear inclusions. The pathogenesis process of herpes simplex virus infection in the body can be divided into fi ve stages: initial skin mucosa infection, acute ganglia infection, latent infections, re-activation, and recurrent infections in susceptible hosts. Patients infected by herpes simplex virus can produce IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies to fi ght directly against virus protein, which may play a role in changing the severity of the infection. Interferon also participates in the control of herpes simplex infection by inhibiting the virus or regulating the defense mechanism. Genetic factors may be also related to the herpes virus infection. Cellular immunity can confi ne the infection. Herpes virus cannot reproduce in the alveolar macrophages of human body, which is also the reason why herpes virus is less than cytomegalovirus in lungs. Currently, it is believed that herpes simplex virus is an important pathogen of respiratory infections, especially in immunocompromised patients.

Meanwhile it intrudes into the bronchi to cause luminal stenosis or obstruction. With its further progression and dissemination, it spreads from the lungs and directly extends into the chest walls, mediastinum, heart, major vessels and other adjacent organs and tissues. Lung cancer can also transfer to other parts of the body along with blood and lymph fl ows or disseminates to other pulmonary lobes via the respiratory tract.

Another rare manifestation of HIV/AIDS related B cell lymphoma is pleural, pericardial or abdominal cavity effusion without scattered masses, which is known as coelom-derived or primary exudative lymphoma.17.7.2 HIV/AIDS Related Kaposi's Sarcoma17.7.2.1 Pathogen and PathogenesisIn the year of 1994, Moore and Chang identifi ed gamma herpes virus in tissues of Kaposi's sarcoma and proved their relationship. Kaposi's sarcoma can be found in any stage of HIV infection, which may occur at even normal level of CD4 T cell count. However, it mostly occurs at a CD4 T cell count being lower than 2,200 \u00d7 10 6 /L. The results of epidemiological studies and the fact of HHV-8 being isolated from Kaposi's sarcoma tissues have demonstrated that Kaposi's sarcoma is closely related to HHV-8 infection. As a result, HHV-8 is known as Kaposi's sarcoma related herpes virus.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "A female patient aged 35 years was confi rmatively diagnosed as having AIDS by the CDC.

The incidence of pulmonary parenchymal lesions is 20-30 %. Chest X-ray demonstrates mediastinal lymph nodes extending directly into the lungs, which is susceptible to confusion with pneumonia. They are demonstrated as round shadows in the lung fi elds or distribute in the whole lung fi elds. Chest X-ray demonstrates the lymphatic spread of lesions as military nodules in different sizes or isolated intrapulmonary nodules or cavities, commonly accompanying with mediastinal hilar lymphadenectasis. In the cases with its occurrence secondary to endobronchial membrance, obstructive pneumonia or atelectasis can be caused. Some patients may have diffuse pulmonary interstitial changes. Pulmonary infi ltration by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can also be divided into four types: (1) Nodular type; (2) Pneumoniaalveolar type; (3) bronchial-vascular-lymphatic type, which can be further divided into the central bronchialvascular type, and diffuse lymphatic type; (4) diffuse lymphatic type can have lesions of reticular or reticular nodular infi ltration and its progression into patchy changes. 3.
