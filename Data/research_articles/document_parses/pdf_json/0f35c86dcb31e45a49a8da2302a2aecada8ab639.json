It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric, and genitourinary bacterial infections. AZ is not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there is no well-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical evidence to support AZ therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 . Nevertheless, there are anecdotal reports that some hospitals have begun to include AZ in combination with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (CQ) for treatment of COVID-19. It is essential that the clinical pharmacology (CP) characteristics of AZ be considered in planning and conducting clinical trials of AZ alone or in combination with other agents, to ensure safe study conduct and to increase the probability of achieving definitive answers regarding efficacy of AZ in the treatment of COVID-19. The safety profile of AZ used as an antibacterial agent is well established. 1 This work assesses published in vitro and clinical evidence for AZ as an agent with antiviral properties. It also provides basic CP information relevant for planning and initiating COVID-19 clinical studies with AZ, summarizes safety data from healthy volunteer studies, and safety and efficacy data from phase II and phase II/III studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, including a phase II/III study in pediatric patients following administration of AZ and CQ in combination. This paper may also serve to facilitate the consideration and use of a priori-defined control groups for future research.",

At Day 6, 100% of patients (6/6) treated with HCQ and AZ had negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, compared with 57.1% patients (8/14) treated with HCQ alone, and 12.5% controls (2/16) (P < 0.001). The authors concluded in this study that HCQ was associated with viral load reduction and its effect was complemented by AZ. In a separate report (preprint), a subsequent single-arm study from the same center, 80 COVID-19 patients (including 6 patients from the prior study) received HCQ and AZ. A rapid fall in nasopharyngeal viral load tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR) was noted, with 83% negative at Day 7, and 93% at Day 8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day 5, which the authors noted was much earlier than untreated patients in prior cases. 3 The authors concluded that HCQ with AZ was potentially effective in reducing transmission and in the therapy of COVID-19.",

The minimum inhibitory concentrations for AZ against most of these bacterial pathogens are \u22642.0 mg/L (2.67 \u00b5M). 1 The antibacterial mechanism of action of AZ is the binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit of microorganisms, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and impeding the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit. 1 AZ is not approved for antiviral therapy but has been studied in vitro and in clinical trials for activity against several viruses. This review was undertaken to assess key AZ published data on in vitro antiviral activity and clinical studies across a variety of viral infections to support the design of future controlled studies.",

            "text": "The precise mechanism is unknown; however, multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the putative antiviral properties observed with AZ. Endosome maturation and function require an acidic environment. AZ is a weak base and preferentially accumulates intracellularly in endosomal vesicles and lysosomes, which could increase pH levels, and potentially block endocytosis and/or viral genetic shedding from lysosomes, thereby limiting viral replication. 15, 16 An acidic environment is also required for the uncoating of enveloped viruses such as influenza and HIV, 17 and a similar mechanism is plausible for coronaviruses, also enveloped viruses. These mechanisms have also been proposed for the antiviral effect noted with HCQ and chloroquine (CQ); 5,6 in fact, evidence suggests that AZ causes a more severe impairment of acidification than CQ. 15 The putative antiviral effects of AZ may also be mediated by a global amplification of the host's interferon (IFN) pathway-mediated antiviral responses. Data suggest that AZ has the ability to induce pattern recognition receptors, IFNs, and IFNstimulated genes, leading to a reduction of viral replication. 8, 14, 18 In addition, AZ directly acts on bronchial epithelial cells to maintain their function and reduce mucus secretion to facilitate lung function. 19 Specific to SARS-CoV-2, recent quantum mechanical modeling suggests a potential role of AZ in interfering with viral entry via binding interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and host receptor ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-2) protein; 20 further experimental work on this is necessary to confirm the model.",

Mean increases in QTcF from baseline ranged from 12 msec to 49.9 msec and overall, 30 (29%), 6 (6%), and 2 (2%) subjects met the criteria of absolute QTcF values of 450 to < 480 msec, 480 to < 500 msec, and \u2265 500 msec, respectively. The QTcF prolongation observed was consistent with that reported for CQ alone and for AZ + CQ in previous studies. REVIEW optimal acidic environment in the intracellular milieu potentially attenuates viral replication. This mechanism is similar to that proposed for CQ and HCQ, and could explain how two drugs, both weak bases, can act in a complementary manner to inhibit viral replication. In a companion in vitro study by investigators in Marseilles, France, when AZ was dosed in combination with HCQ, 2,3 a synergistic effect was observed in vitro against SARS-CoV-2; however, no EC 50 was determined. 7 The determination of in vitro EC 50 for agents administered alone and in combination against SARS-CoV-2 under similar experimental conditions is needed to further understand the putative antiviral effect of this combination. Other possible mechanisms including the amplification of the host's IFN pathway-mediated antiviral responses as well as AZ's potential to interfere with viral entry requires further experimental work. Drugs known to interact with AZ, HCQ, or CQ are noted in their respective product labels. 1, 34, 35 In a study designed specifically to evaluate interaction between AZ and CQ, drug-drug interactions were not observed 36 and similar results would be expected with HCQ. CQ and HCQ are both substrates and potential inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp); 37-39 however, given that AZ is not a sensitive substrate of P-gp, 40 potential inhibition of P-gp by HCQ would not be expected to significantly impact the systemic exposure of AZ as observed in the aforementioned study with CQ. Furthermore, CQ and HCQ are metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 pathways, including cytochrome P450 3A, which AZ has not been shown to substantially modulate. 1, 41, 42 Although AZ has been shown to be an inhibitor of P-gp, 43 AZ is unlikely to affect the lung penetration of HCQ, given that HCQ is highly permeable; thus P-gp efflux would not be expected to be rate limiting. The lung penetration of HCQ in humans has not been reported; however, data in toxicology studies in albino rats, at human-equivalent plasma exposure, suggests HCQ distributes to the lung at concentrations of approximately 92 \u00b5M, 44 which is far in excess of its EC 50 values against SARS-CoV-2. 4 A favorable clinical outcome is unlikely without clearance of the pathogen. However, translating the effect on viral (or bacterial) clearance into a clinical outcome in patients is confounded by the disease, variability in patients, design of the studies, and end points measured. This is apparent in the literature on clinical studies and observations with AZ in a variety of viral infections, which present a mixed picture of the utility of AZ dosed alone or with other drugs in the treatment of viral infection. Nonetheless, RNA-sequencing data from the MORDOR II (Macrolides Oraux pour R\u00e9duire les D\u00e9c\u00e8s avec un Oeil sur la R\u00e9sistance) study on the reduction in both alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus burden and from the recent studies in COVID-19 patients 3 provides exploratory evidence on AZ, alone or in combination, against SARS-CoV-2, a novel beta-coronavirus.",

Available data on the concomitant use of AZ and CQ in these studies indicated no increased risk of QT prolongation above that of CQ alone. In a recent preprint, 47 it was reported that in COVID-19 patients (N = 84), 11% of patients treated with an unspecified dosage regimen of HCQ and AZ had recorded QT intervals > 500 msec and 12% of patients had a change from baseline of > 60 msec; there were no events of torsade de pointes recorded.",
