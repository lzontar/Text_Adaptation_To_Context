Other patients with chronic diseases have been confronted with difficulties in routine medical treatments due to inadequate supply of transportation, medicines and shortage of equipment and human resources in hospitals. Another issue relating to quarantine is legality. Although in the Infectious Disease Control Act (IDCA) in China (The national People's Congress of the People Republic of China, 2020), it is said that quarantine could be used as a preventive measure for confirmed and suspected patient, and pathogen carriers, in this epidemic, quarantine has been imposed more widely than the range of Infectious Disease Control Act.",

The psychiatrists and psychotherapists were not only responsible for the mental state of the patients, but also responsible for supporting the medical staff. Diagnoses of mental disorder, medications, individual and group therapies through smart phone were made. In addition to these psychiatrists and psychotherapists, non-medical support including psychological counselors and social workers were working mainly for the public outside the hospitals.
