While the mental health impact of this is largely unknown, we do know from other epidemics like SARS that individual behaviours are shaped by extreme circumstances such as the psychological impact of quarantine [3] . With Covid-19, people who are segregated and quarantined are not just individuals who test positive for infection, but also those who are exposed to contagion and likely to develop serious health consequences as a result. The lockdown, whereby most of the population are confined to their homes, amounts to a huge collective experiment. It is a new 'norm', a generalised condition affecting everyone, at home, in health care facilities and all residential settings. The imperatives for social distancing and quarantine amount to societally sanctioned forms of involuntary seclusion and restraint, more usually seen in psychiatric hospitals.",

Some may resort to denial and escape from reality, obstinately maintaining their habitual lifestyle 'despite everything'. But, above all, long-term isolation can foster a condition of generalised trauma, with potential short-term as well as long-term consequences. Faced with an invisible contagion that you acquire and pass on as a consequence of your own behaviour, the social perception of disease becomes distorted through blame and guilt, both individual and collective. This can trigger unjustified forms of prejudice and stigma against individuals (who have been sick) or entire populations or particular groups [4] .",

The social, therapeutic and rehabilitative values of community mental health services are under threat because of the new emphasis on restrained, guarded social spaces. This reveals the fragility of a mental health system built on clinical 'places'. Hospital wards, emergency rooms and casualty departments have become sources of infection and places of contagion. Similarly, extra-hospital environments, the normal social spaces of the community and common life, are also sites of possible infection due to their normative functions, such as social meeting and exchange. This includes mental health facilities and communities where people live together, such as mental health residential care and supported housing. Already, we are seeing outbreaks of infection involving health care workers and guests in some care homes. However, national guidance seems slow in catching onto the need to provide tailored consideration of how to respond to the crisis in these settings. The size of the facility and style of management appear to be crucial factors: small group homes run as families, sharing a common view and approach with their guests, are, in the main, safe spaces, while larger residential facilities-more institution-like-such as elderly nursing homes are suffering. This is a general lesson to be learnt here: moving from standardized, institutional structures to personalized, tailored approach and services.",

Ironically, the social isolation sometimes seen in people with psychotic problems is now being normalised as part of the social behaviour imposed on everyone. This is the 'new normal'. Some individuals with serious mental health problems have also disappeared from services, holed up in houses, hospitals, supported accommodation and prisons. However, both the alienation generated by the absence of social ties and the exacerbation of conflict experienced within families can sharpen and lead to moments of crisis.",

Well-intentioned prohibitions in extreme circumstances can easily become normative-resulting in a paranoid form of asocial regression and a form of 'mass hibernation'. At the same time, how can social distancing and self-isolation be enforced in a humane manner for those who cannot fully understand its importance to the survival of the population as well as the individual? Maintaining proximity and familiarity in everyday life, whether through intimacy or enforced closeness, may still be required.

High-risk groups include patients with delusions, obsessive-compulsive thoughts and behaviours, somatic symptoms, or those previously exposed to severe trauma [7] . Diagnosis by itself is a poor predictor of vulnerability. In identifying those at high risk, we need to consider a range of social factors and determinants of mental health and illmental health as well as subjective reactions based on individual life stories. For example, in countries like the US, a large number of people with serious mental illness are in jails, nursing and group homes or are homeless with limited access to medical and psychiatric care. They may be exposed to high risks. More frequent contact may be necessary for these groups to help them deal with emerging concerns and avoid serious exacerbation of existing problems or hospitalisation. People who are most vulnerable-not only in the medical or psychiatric sense, but socially-should be reached by telephone. Having a landline or a mobile phone is now recognized as a necessity for health so that electronic stores are allowed to stay open. Such contact may be as important as medication and help to contain the risks associated with quarantine and lockdown. The key to providing support is more extensive teleworking, with an emphasis on fostering relationships and a proxy sense of family and home, a sort of remote 'tele-heart' and 'tele-hearth'. In building and maintaining contact with these vulnerable groups, it is not just mental health but individual narratives and social situations that should be kept in mind.",

This will ensure an effective response to whole life needs, protecting not only health but also human rights of people living in institutions, hospitals, prisons, shelters, nursing homes, group homes and other special facilities, which means acting for their deinstitutionalization. For those experiencing social deprivation, this will mean increasing access to care. It is important to implement the emergency national plans dedicated to mental health in the affected countries, called for the World Health Organization and reiterated by the World Federation for Mental Health [10] , and most recently prompted by the United Nations [11] . It has never been more urgent to step aside from individualistic notions and embrace the values and practices of sharing and solidarity, both civil and social. This will enhance our sense of being part of a community. Mental health services, which have a long history of community networking and engagement, can act as exemplars and provide essential bridges to a 'new normal', with collaboration and shared responsibilities for each other at its heart.",
