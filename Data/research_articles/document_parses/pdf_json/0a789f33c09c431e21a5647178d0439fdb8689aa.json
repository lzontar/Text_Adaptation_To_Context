R Caorsi speaker's fees 14 and consultancies for Novartis and SOBI 15 Key words: interleukin-1, anakinra, cytokine release syndrome, COVID-19syndrome plays a crucial pathogenic role in COVID-19 pneumonia. This pilot study 19 provides the first evidence of the safety of anti-IL-1 treatment with highdose IV anakinra respiratory failure and fatal outcome (1). The appearance of clinical signs of severe 35 pneumonia is associated with progressive and persistent elevation of D-dimer and inflammatory 36 markers, including ferritin, a laboratory biomarker of macrophage activation (1). These findings 37 are consistent with the characteristics of the immunopathological infiltrate described in lungs 38 infected with SARS-CoV-2, which is marked by diffuse macrophage infiltration and is consistent 39 with cytokine overproduction (2, 3). These features are reminiscent of syndromes characterized 40 by overt inflammation driven by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as macrophage 41 activation syndrome and Still's disease, which suggests that an early anti-inflammatory approach 42 in patients who develop interstitial pneumonia could be crucial to prevent the progression of lung 43 damage towards respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support and ultimately death (4). 44 The interleukin (IL)-6 blocker tocilizumab, administeredrated with the same protocol used in 45 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) secondary to chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) therapies, has 46 provided encouraging preliminary results (5). These results support the use of anti-inflammatory treatments in the management of COVID-19-related pneumonia. The potential effectiveness of 48 glucocorticoid (GC) therapy, although controversial, has been recently highlighted in patients with 49 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (6). The rapid expansion of the pandemic in Italy in the 50 past weeks has led to a shortage of tocilizumab, thus prompting the search for alternative 51 therapeutic strategies based on other cytokine blockers (7). Recent studies have shown that 52 coronavirus regulates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by inducing the maturation and 53 secretion of IL-1\u03b2 (8), suggesting a potential role for IL-1 inhibitors in the management of the 54 inflammatory complications induced by SARS-CoV-2. 55Here we report the first experience with the early use of high IV doses of the recombinant IL-1 56 receptor antagonist (anakinra) in 5 patients with severe/moderate COVID-19 with pulmonary 57 involvement. The rationale for the use of anakinra at high doses IV, rather than at the standard 58 regimen of 100 mg/daily subcutaneously, derives from previous experiences in other conditions 59 characterized by massive cytokine release, such as severe secondary hemophagocytic 60 lymphohistiocytosis (9) and sepsis (10).",

            "text": "69All five patients experienced rapid resolution of systemic inflammation, and remarkable 70 improvement of respiratory parameters, with reduction of oxygen support requirement and early 71 amelioration of chest CT scan abnormalities before discharge in 3 patients(Table 1, Fig.1A-C). All 72 patients were discharged 6 to 13 days after the start of anakinra. No secondary infections or other 73 adverse events were observed. 74 These results compare favourably with literature data, showing that patients with a similar 75 inflammatory phenotype and severe respiratory impairment have high risk for a lethal outcome 76 (1). Our decision to use anakinra was motivated by the shortage of tocilizumab and by the high 77 mortality rate previously observed in our centre among patients with prominent inflammatory 78 features and marked respiratory distress. In our preliminary experience, the addition of high-79 dose IV anakinra to the standard of care enabled rapid control of the inflammatory manifestations 80 and led to a favorable outcome. 81 We acknowledge the limitations related to the non-controlled nature of our study, the small size 82 of the patients population, the short-term duration of the treatment, and the variability of 83 laboratory biomarkers. However, these preliminary findings suggest the potential safety of an 84 early anti-inflammatory treatment with high doses of IV anakinra, , in the CRS occurring in COVID-85 19 patients. We propose therefore, to add anakinra to the list of possible anti-cytokine treatments 86 for COVID-19-related pneumonia (6). The ultimate assessment of the efficacy and safety of 87 anakinra therapy in COVID-19 pneumonia should be conducted in the context of randomized 88 clinical trials. In this line, an open label trial based on the administration of 400 mg IV daily of 89anakinra for 14 days, has just started patient recruitment in Italy (NCT04324021) and will provide 90 further evidence. In our preliminary experience, even lower doses of IV anakinra and shorter treatment duration provided an favourable outcome, without significant side-effects,",
