When participating in making policy, cardiothoracic surgeons should advocate for: a. decision-making transparency and efficient use of resources; b. limiting or cancelling elective or nonurgent procedures in order to limit exposure to the infective agent and to preserve equipment and supplies for treating seriously ill patients; c. clear triage guidelines to be applied when resources are severely depleted. 3. Cardiothoracic surgeons should participate in the creation and supervision of: a. teams that, where possible, care exclusively for emergency surgical patients unrelated to the pandemic and are isolated from patients experiencing pandemicrelated infection; b. geographically isolated cohorts for noninfected surgical patients, preferably in dedicated cardiothoracic surgical care units; c. dedicated multidisciplinary care teams, particularly for ECMO; d. evaluation and management of patients with cardiothoracic surgical emergencies. 4. When caring for their infected patients, cardiothoracic surgeons should: a. use all appropriate personal protective equipment and measures to mitigate risk of exposure to the contagion; b. follow patient acuity and triage guidelines established by the hospital, department, or division; c. collaborate in ventilator and hemodynamic management; d. provide evaluation, cannulation, and management of ECMO; e. help manage complications of mechanical ventilation and ECMO; f. collaborate with triage and patient care teams in making decisions to withdraw ventilator or ECMO support when continuing life support becomes medically inappropriate.",
