As cats spread into a wide range of habitats, there are concerns regarding the best methods to control their numbers. Predation on wildlife, public health and zoonotic diseases, as well as the welfare of the cats themselves, are issues that drive the need to control the feral cat population. Killing the cats, or letting nature take its course, were the usual historical approaches but in recent years non-lethal methods have been espoused as being more humane and effective. Efforts have been made to improve the welfare of feral cat populations through sterilization, the control of infectious disease and ensuring that they are adequately cared for. A combination of approaches are necessary to decrease feral cat numbers, to prevent influx of owned cats into the population, and to manage established feral cat colonies successfully.",

Feral cats are likely to be found wherever humans have traveled, either as escapees from domestication or as deliberately introduced controllers of rodents or other pests (Figure 1 ). The interest in feral cats may focus on animal control, especially in countries where the free-roaming dog problem no longer is a major concern, or on issues such as predation, public health or the well-being of the cats themselves. Feral cats are still viewed by many as creatures living on the borders of civilized communities. This view reinforces the peripheral status of cats and emphasizes their wild or natural propensities. There are also those who argue that feral cats do not belong in the wild, because they are introduced predators of more valued species. I hope to throw some light on the discussion about where feral cats belong, and how to deal with them, by examining selected English language publications, particularly those from the past fifteen years. I have used the scientific literature when it is available but for some types of information, lay publications and personal communication are the only available sources. the reliance on humans for food and shelter (strays) or independence of humans (ferals) (Hugh-Jones et al. 1995; Dickman 1996b) .",

However, the term is commonly used to describe the relationship between cats and humans, in the context of \"socialization to humans\". I use the term socialized rather than tame, as it is a more accurate description of those cats that are adoptable. The socialized or unsocialized (feral) status must be determined, recognizing that there is considerable variability among cats which may be modified by the situation and change with time. The experience, knowledge and type of interaction of the observer may have a great influence over the gestalt assessment of each cat's sociability. Many factors have been shown to affect the socialization of cats, and are discussed in Chapter 3.",

Data on the proportion of owned cats that are allowed to roam are not available, and probably vary widely between countries. There may be many stray cats that could potentially become feral. Studies in the United States found that about 22% of owned cats were acquired as strays (New, Jr. et al. 2000) . Another study of a single community found that 25% of owned pets were former strays and 63% of cats entering a shelter were impounded strays (Patronek et al. 1997) . Litters from owned cats are another potential source of feral cats. One study in Massachusetts reported that over 90% of all cats (male and female) were sterilized. In spite of this high sterilization rate 15% of currently sterilized female cats had previously had litters, with a similar number of total litters per female for intact and sterilized cats (Manning & Rowan 1998 ).",

In warmer climates there may be larger numbers of free-roaming unowned cats, since females are able to produce two to three litters in a prolonged warm season and mild winters will result in lower mortality. The number of free-roaming cats will also depend upon the popularity of cats as pets, the beliefs of the owners regarding cats' need to go outdoors, the sterilization rate, the availability of food and shelter and the existence of other predators (see Chapters 3 and 5).",

Thus, the presence of a localized, stable and large food source appears to be the primary reason for group living in domestic cats (Smith & Shane 1986; Liberg et al. 2000) .

The hope is that \"nature will take its course\" and cats will be killed or move away. In reality, doing nothing is a poor choice for the cats and is not a solution to the problem. Therefore, methods for dealing with populations of free-roaming and feral cats have been developed, and can be divided into three main approaches. The first is to kill cats on site, the second is to trap and remove cats for euthanasia or relocation, and the third is to trap, neuter and return cats to the original location.",

Since cats are very adaptable, they have survived and reproduced, accommodating to different food sources. They are also fecund, giving birth to one to three litters per year of two to six kittens. Since cats are sexually mature at five or six months of age, this can result in a substantial number of cats in a short period, even with very high mortality rates. Moreover, if they die from disease or human intervention, other cats move in to take advantage of the newly available space and food supplies (Tabor 1983) . This is especially the case in locations that are not geographically isolated. These facts suggest that wholesale slaughtering is not a practical solution to permanently eliminating a colony.",

This view arises from the change in the perception of non-human animals from property, incapable of feelings or thoughts, to animals as companions that experience pain, hunger and other emotions. An example of this change and how it affects animals occurred in April 2003, in the cities of Mataro and Barcelona, Spain. These cities prohibited shelters from destroying stray cats and dogs that were not severely ill, injured or dangerous (www.aldf.org). This change appears to have been due to actions by several animal welfare and rescue organizations, one of which recently took over the government shelter in Barcelona. In Italy, a 1991 law prohibited the abuse or removal of feral cats from their colonies and made provision for the Public Veterinary Services to sterilize the cats (Natoli et al. 1999 ). The trap, neuter and return method (see section 5.3) has become widespread in Italy. More recently, the cats of Rome were given the status of \"patrimonio bioculturale\" that is, that they are a bio-cultural heritage (www.romancats.de/romancats/news/article.php?Id=100) ( Figure 2 ).

Control or eradication of the cats was deemed to be possible, if the assumptions in the model were correct regarding baiting rate, transmission rate, mortality, and determinants of population growth. Concerns about virus-vectored approaches include effects on non-target species, public acceptance of genetically-engineered organisms, spread of the vector outside the targeted location, irreversibility, genetic changes in the target species or vector, rate of response to exposure and limited knowledge of potential vector candidates (Courchamp & Cornell 2000) .",

While relocation to a farm setting or placement in a high quality sanctuary are attractive solutions, they are not practical as the sole solution due to the large numbers of feral cats and the limited funding available.

Before release back into the colony, the ear of the cat should be tipped or notched to indicate that it has been sterilized (Cuffe et al. 1983) (Figure 3) . The aim of a TNR program is to create a stable population where cats can no longer reproduce; natural attrition will eventually decrease numbers or at least maintain a stable number of cats. Since cats are returned to the original habitat, a vacuum is not left to encourage cats from nearby areas to move in or remaining intact cats to repopulate. Because there is always the potential for cats to join the colony, the program must continue to trap new cats that migrate into the area. An aggressive adoption program for tame adults and kittens under about eight weeks of age will reduce the numbers of cats in the colony more quickly (Levy et al. 2003) . Sterilization decreases roaming of male cats, improves body condition and tends to make cats more interactive with their caretakers (Scott & Levy 2003) . Thus, TNR together with adoption and monitoring programs are the most effective and humane options for the long-term control of feral cat colonies. TNR also retains the positive aspects of the presence of cats in specific locations. These include rodent control, especially in cities and around houses and barns, the opportunity to learn about cat behaviour and social interactions, the aesthetic benefits of cats in the urban environment and the relationships between the cats and their human neighbors and caretakers (Natoli 1994) (Figure 4 ). I am aware of three locations, two in the United States and one in England, where TNR programs and coordinated efforts to address the sources of feral cats led to the disappearance of colonies. Although about ten years was required for this to occur, this demonstrates that TNR is a humane and successful management technique for the feral cat population (Remfry 1996) .",

Cats are blood tested to see if they are infected with FeLV or FIV. This testing is controversial, as costs are high and cats positive for these viruses are usually euthanized or placed in sanctuaries. Placing virus-positive feral cats in sanctuaries is difficult, as most sanctuaries have so many healthy socialized cats needing homes that it may not be practical to spend resources on these feral cats. Testing should not be performed if no action is to be taken for virus-positive cats. There are also other reasons not to test. The prevalence of FeLV and FIV in feral cats is usually quite low, as low or lower than that found in owned cats (Lee et al. 2002) . FeLV is spread by prolonged close contact between cats and from mother to kittens, and is not highly contagious. FIV is spread by biting during fighting, particularly among males, and its transmission is curtailed when cats are sterilized. FIV infection has a different natural history than FeLV in that infected cats can often live for a normal lifespan (see Chapter 8). Control programs usually decide to test based on the opinion of their veterinarians and on the trade off of costs and benefits. Whether cats are vaccinated for disease other than rabies will depend on the program. Most feral cats are likely to have been exposed to the common infectious diseases. Vaccination may be performed in order to protect the organization from negative comments, since their feral cats will be as well protected against viral diseases as pet cats.",

In the late 1990's, most of the large animal-protection organizations, as well as the national veterinary organization, acknowledged the usefulness of TNR, at least under certain specified circumstances. At the same time many bird, wildlife and public health organizations developed policy statements against TNR, primarily because of concerns regarding predation, rabies and lack of data on efficacy. Because laws governing cats are usually made at the local city level, general statements about the acceptance of TNR are not possible. Several large programs in the northeast and west have become increasingly high profile in animal welfare and animal protection conferences and web sites, indicating a growing awareness, if not always acceptance, of TNR as a humane method for the control of feral cats. Alley Cat Allies is a national organization dedicated to TNR for feral cats with over 90,000 donors and supporters in 2003.",

Litters of kittens were not reported during the study, and two cats became more social with the people feeding them. Beginning in 2002, the efficacy of TNR in the Unites States began to be described in the scientific literature. One was a campus TNR program in Texas where the first two years of data were presented . During that period 158 cats were trapped ( Figure 5 ), 101 were returned and 32 kittens and tame adults were adopted. The number of kittens trapped decreased significantly between the first and second year, as did the number of complaints to the university pest control service. During the following three years, the number of trapped cats continued to decrease. Totals for the five years of the program were: 226 cats trapped, 105 returned to campus (Slater 2003) . Of those returned, 15 were eventually adopted and seven were killed or died. No kittens were born on campus after the second year and fewer than 20 cats were trapped in each of the last two years of the program, with almost half being tame cats or kittens.",

Although the feral cat population is much in evidence, feral cats are not a common concern of the public or the government. In general, cats as pets and companions are not highly valued or commonly kept (personal communication, Rama Santschi, DVM, July 17, 2003) . Cats primarily come into the public and government awareness as nuisances or concern about rabies. Feral cats have been rounded up and destroyed for 50 years without making any difference to numbers. However, the Cat Welfare Society of Israel has been active since 1990, and members have made strong efforts to network and learn from existing programs about controlling feral cat populations and implementing spay/neuter programs. Recently, the Society has sterilized about 4,500 cats a year and provides a trapping and transportation service. Several cities have begun TNR programs but most have not persisted with them due to a combination of limited funding, lack of commitment by the government and shortage of structural support. Added to the complexity of the situation is the fact that, on the one hand, the Ministry of Environment administers animal rights and protection and also supports TNR, both philosophically and financially. On the other hand, the Department of Veterinary Services is part of the Ministry of Agriculture and tends to promote lethal methods to control cat populations. City-employed veterinarians are in charge of municipal animal activities and tend not to understand or become involved in TNR or subsidized sterilization programs. Nationally, the Supreme Court determined in 1997 that the mass killing of dogs and cats was not permitted, and that each animal-related complaint must be evaluated. The Court also declared that non-lethal solutions, including TNR, should be sought, and refined the rules regarding the control of rabies. Unfortunately, this has not stopped some private trappers from continuing to trap and kill cats under regulations from the Ministry of Agriculture. Although the situation has improved with more sterilization programs, less killing of cats and increasing awareness of TNR as a solution to the problem, funding and veterinary support continue to be limiting factors. A recent article describes how the existing literature on free-roaming cats can be applied to the situation in Israel (Gunther & Terkel 2002) . The conclusions of the authors were to promote trap, neuter, identify and return programs in conjunction with community level solutions like keeping garbage cans securely covered, education and dealing with specific problems. They recommended trap and euthanasia only for cats in very poor condition.",

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other welfare groups countered this with a call to end the culling of cats. The following day, the AVA reversed its position and denied a link between the culling and SARS, and indicated that it was for other public health reasons. In 1998, AVA's Stray Cat Rehabilitation Scheme had sterilized about 5,000 cats through their own Cat Welfare Society, but with the initiation of culling this sterilization program was put on hold. Animal welfare organizations continue to seek to relocate cats to sanctuaries and end the culling of cats. While TNR had been implemented in Singapore, it has not been adopted at a level to decrease cat-related complaints significantly. Furthermore, Singapore's example illustrates that even when there is a government program for TNR, its position may revert to old methods of removal and euthanasia in large numbers without good reason.",

Firstly, stray cats need to be reunited with their families; in the United States, only 2 to 3% of all cats entering shelters are returned to their owners (Zawistowski et al. 1998; Wenstrup & Dowidchuck 1999) . The reunification rate is improved substantially in locations where major microchipping and identification programs of cats have been implemented (Slater 2002) . Secondly, cats allowed outside should be sterilized and thirdly, owners should seek help for behavioural, medical or pet selection problems. Many owners do not keep their cats long-term because of a lack of knowledge about normal cat behaviour and social needs (New, Jr. et al. 2000) . They may relinquish a cat to a shelter after living with its behaviour problem for years, rather than seeking help early on when the situation could be improved (DiGiacomo et al. 1998) . Subsidized sterilization should be available for those who cannot afford full-cost services, and owners should be helped to find homes for cats they cannot keep. Leadership at both national and local levels is needed (Christiansen 1998) . Components of community-based programs should include: 1) public education from pre-school to adult; 2) improving the quality of animal control; 3) developing expertise in urban animal management; and 4) understanding companion animal population dynamics (Murray 1992) .",

            "text": "There are several themes that arise in discussions of feral cats and wildlife. The first is based on a philosophical belief that since cats are a domestic species, they should not be allowed to hunt wildlife but should be confined indoors, to an enclosure or yard or on a leash (arguably for the cats' welfare as well as for that of wildlife).The second theme is that cats are an introduced, non-native species and therefore should be removed from the environment. There are several assumptions underlying this argument: firstly, introduced or non-native species are harmful and native species should be protected from them. However, cattle and sheep are routinely protected from coyotes, foxes and wolves, despite the latter being native species that are killed because they may prey on domestic species (Cohen 1992) . In some locations, native mountain lions, northern harriers and kestrels have been killed to prevent them from preying on rare species (Cohen 1992) . The second assumption is that if we remove cats from the environment, the ecosystems will return to \"normal\" or to the pre-cat situation. However, ecosystems are complex and have often been heavily influenced by the effects of human habitation including construction, changes in fire control and water movement, pollution and the introduction of livestock. There are often other introduced plant and animal species (starlings or rats) that affect the balance of the ecosystem. For example, removing cats in certain locations may cause serious problems from the resulting increases in rodent populations. The third theme is the actual impact of cats on wildlife, largely through predation but also through competition or disease. While competition is commonly cited as a concern, little evidence is available to support this claim (George 1974) . Predation is generally considered to be the most serious problem, especially predation of birds. Again, the interaction between cats and wildlife varies widely from location to location, and is heavily influenced by other environmental factors such as variety of prey species, the reliance of cats on garbage or being fed, other pressures on local species, climate and the biology of threatened species.",

Methods of quantifying the diet of feral or free-roaming cats include examining intestinal samples from cats that are killed, scat (faeces) analysis, recording prey brought home by owned cats and examination of dead or partially eaten prey found in the environment. The results of diet studies do not provide evidence of the impact on a species unless prey species abundance is also monitored, as well as the species' reproductive capacity and other sources of predation and mortality (Churcher & Lawton 1987; Martin et al. 1996; Risbey et al. 1999; Edwards et al. 2000) . While predation patterns in a given location are unique, there are some generalizations that can be made. On continents mammals are the main prey eaten by cats, with birds forming about 20% of the diet (Fitzgerald & Turner 2000) . The amount of household food available to cats will depend on the density of the human population. Australian cats living near refuse dumps and towns were found to have food scraps as a high proportion of their diet, while the diet of those living distant from human habitation contained few food scraps (Risbey et al. 1999) .",

Cats sometimes precipitate this belief by presenting their owners with prey (Dunn & Tessaglia 1994) . Sweeping generalizations are often made about cat predation and are not always based on the offered evidence (Gray 1999) . Additionally, data are often extrapolated inappropriately (Dunn & Tessaglia 1994) . Studies that count the number of prey returned to owners are subject to many kinds of biases. Owners of cats that are better hunters are more likely to volunteer for prey studies (Fitzgerald & Turner 2000) . Relatively few cats bring in very large numbers of prey, skewing the results and artificially inflating the mean number of prey; using the median would be a more suitable measure.",

In these settings, feral cats may be useful in controlling rodents and introduced species, and are likely to have little impact on endangered or declining species. The large population of some birds and pests in urban environments has been attributed to a variety of factors including a reduced number of predators, favourable microclimates and/or food availability (Sorace 2002) . Studies of three Italian parks found high prey (including pest species such as pigeons, starlings, mice and rats) and high predator (birds of prey, crows, cats, dogs, rats and foxes) densities compared to the nearby countryside (Sorace 2002) . The numbers of nest predators such as blue jays, raccoons and opossums, and of bird species that lay their eggs in nests of other species, often grow in urban environments due to a proliferation of food supplies (Terborgh 1992) . In addition, current \"garden\" or suburban birds may be under less predation pressure from cats than they would be from the range of native predators that no longer co-exist close to human habitation (Mead 1982) .",

Nevertheless, cat control was still a major focus of the authors.

            "text": "Islands have less species diversity, a scarcity of predators and a higher concentration of individuals relative to similar mainland environments (Sorace 2002) . Islands with introduced cats differ enormously in climate, size and native species, but generally have relatively few native mammals (Fitzgerald & Turner 2000) . The same set of introduced species is common: house mice, rats and European rabbits. Where rabbits are present, they tend to be the main prey of cats. Predation on rats and mice varies between locations. Cats survive on islands without mammals by eating seabirds on small islands and land birds on larger islands. Australia is arguably the best studied and most high profile country when it comes to feral cats and predation, and is considered to be an example of the serious threat that feral cats pose to wildlife. However, as of 1995, there were \"no critical studies of the impact of feral cats on native fauna in Australia\" (Dickman 1996b) . What has been documented is the association between rainfall, species' habitat and dietary preferences, and the decline and extinction of species (Burbidge & McKenzie 1989) . European settlement led to a reduction in vegetative cover, increased human settlements and introduced species, including livestock, and changes in control of fires in the environment. Exotic predators likely exacerbated the situation, depending on the protective habitat of the prey species. Feral cats are not recorded to have had a significant impact on any species of reptiles, amphibians, fish or invertebrates (Dickman 1996b) ; however, they may have localized effects on populations of native vertebrates. Despite much publicity, the role of feral cats in the decline and extinction of Australian mammalian species remains unclear (Burbidge & Manly 2002) Finally, in addition to direct predation, there have been concerns about diseases that could be spread from cats to wildlife. The 'Alala bird in Hawaii became endangered possibly due to disease, loss of genetic diversity, introduced predators or habitat loss (Work et al. 2000) . Reintroduction programs were limited by the presence of the microorganism Toxoplasma gondii (for whom the cat is the main host) in four of 27 captive-reared birds due for re-introduction. It is unclear if these particular birds or 'Alala birds in general are especially susceptible to toxoplasmosis, perhaps due to a genetic predisposition. Toxoplasmosis was suggested to be a contributing factor to local decreases in eastern barred bandicoots in Australia (Dickman 1996b) .",

This is illustrated by a mathematical model including birds, rats and cats, which showed that removing all cats led to a surge in rat numbers, resulting in the extinction of the bird species (prey) . Another model examined the relationship between birds (prey), rabbits (an introduced prey species) and cats (the predator) in an island setting . Based on field observations, rabbits provide food for other predators and, in times of plenty, are the primary diet of cats. This allows for a larger population of cats than could ordinarily be sustained if rabbits were scarce or not present. When rabbit populations are reduced, cats are able to switch to other prey species (such as birds). Similarly, the widespread availability of cat food could lead to larger populations of cats than would otherwise be possible if only local prey were available.",

These differences were believed to be due to a decrease in the birds' macro-invertebrate prey (especially weevils and flightless moths), which may have been due to increases in house mice as a result of the cat eradication, decreases in burrowing petrels (which promote invertebrate species), and climate warming, which also increases mouse populations. This example illustrates that the removal of cats may not result in the recovery of a threatened species.",

The latter two groups were combined for analysis, which makes reaching conclusions about the feral cats difficult. Prevalence of FIV in both groups was 22% (9/40 indoor and 14/63 outdoor cats) and of FeLV was 5% in indoor and 6% in outdoor cats. FIV was more common in male cats; the high prevalence may be related to the fact that most cats were not neutered. The indoor cats may have been previously outdoor cats or from the same household as some of the outdoor cats, which could bias the infectious disease frequency, but no data were given. These studies demonstrate the variability of disease prevalence in different populations of owned and feral cats, and the difficulty in making comparisons between studies that define cat populations differently.",

FIV was more common in males. Among a larger sample (5,766) of cats from Operation Catnip, nine cats were euthanized for serious health problems (other than FIV and FeLV) and 17 died from apparent anesthetic complications (nine had physical abnormalities that may have contributed to their deaths), giving a mortality rate of 0.35% (Williams et al. 2002) . A program on Prince Edward Island, Canada, trapped and tested 185 cats and kittens during a 14-week period (Gibson et al. 2002) . Prevalence of FeLV was 5%, of FIV was 6% and three cats were positive for both viruses; as in previous studies, FIV was more common in males. These diseases tended to occur within specific colonies, with other colonies being clear of infection. These studies demonstrate that colonies undergoing TNR tend to have few health problems and a low prevalence of FIV and FeLV, suggesting that feral cats in managed colonies, at least, pose limited health risks to other cats.

This is largely due to the development of sensitivity toward animal welfare and a shift in how animals, particularly cats, are perceived. All those concerned have a common goal: fewer feral and free-roaming cats. There is often intense conflict, however, over what to do with these cats and who is responsible for them. Increasingly, there is resistance to killing cats simply because they are a nuisance, prey on wildlife or may be a threat to public health. Organizations and governments need to find non-lethal, effective, and humane methods to control feral cat populations, and comprehensive and creative communitywide programs need to address the sources of feral cats. As cats become more popular as pets and society continues to evaluate the role and care of non-human animals, the welfare of feral cats will become an increasingly central issue for individuals, societies, organizations and governments.",
