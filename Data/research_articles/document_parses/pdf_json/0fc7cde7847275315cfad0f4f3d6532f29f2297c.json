Neither of these M a n u s c r i p t 5 requirements is unique to COVID-19 RCTs, but the complexities of both are exacerbated by its breadth and urgency. 4 We share here the current methods used by the University of Michigan (Office of Research) and its health system, Michigan Medicine, to address these issues. To do so, we also adopted three overarching goals: (1) support the rapid development of generalizable evidence; (2) ensure responsible stewardship of scarce research resources; and (3) establish a fair and transparent system of protocol review and recruitment from the perspective of patients, clinicians, and researchers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 271, "end": 274, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 589, "end": 590, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "While researchers want to explore all potential interventions, and hospitals want to support as many trials as feasible, limited research and participant resources can slow enrollment and delay results. Hospitals need a formal process to efficiently evaluate proposed trials. 5 We established the Michigan Medicine COVID-19 Clinical Trials Feasibility Review Committee, made up of neutral and diverse experts, to assess the safety and scientific plausibility of proposed interventions in order to best allocate participants into well-designed studies of promising agents. We designed a rigorous and transparent process modeled after the National Institutes of Health study sections to review the following domains: scientific plausibility, significance, research plan, practicality, investigator and study team, patient and institutional burden, and safety. (Table 1) 6, 7 While these areas are common across trial assessment rubrics, concurrently running multiple RCTs at a single institution studying the same disease, the virulence of COVID-19, and exacerbation of health disparities, require additional considerations. As to the first issue, important questions include: Is the scientific plausibility of the proposed intervention sufficient to justify testing in very ill and vulnerable patients? Is the therapeutic mechanism A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 6 proposed distinct from an existing trial? If there is overlap in inclusion criteria, are there enough prospective participants to rapidly meet enrollment targets?", "cite_spans": [{"start": 276, "end": 277, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 868, "end": 870, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 871, "end": 872, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 858, "end": 867, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Assessment of which trials have the best chance of benefiting current and future patients"}, {"text": "Second, while we are used to assessing potential benefit to the participant and importance of the knowledge expected to result from research, the virulence and transmissibility of COVID-19 requires us to weigh these potential benefits against both the potential risk to the participant as well as the study team.

If there must be contact between the study team and participant, is there sufficient personal protective equipment available?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Assessment of which trials have the best chance of benefiting current and future patients"}, {"text": "Finally, we must be cognizant of the fact that COVID-19 is overrepresented in minority patients. 8 Ensuring equitable enrollment in, and access to, RCTs is critical.

Under the foundational ethics principle of 'respect for persons,' we enable informed consent for each individual participant by discussing risks, benefits, and alternatives to enrollment. Nevertheless, offering patients a 'choice' between several different COVID-19 RCTs for which they might qualify raises three important considerations. Therefore, in order to provide a balance between enabling participant autonomy as well as the timely production of generalizable results, we have adopted a process by which patients who meet inclusion criteria for multiple trials are prioritized to a 'primary' and a 'secondary' trial. If they choose not to enroll in the primary trial, but express interest in future research opportunities, the secondary team will approach them. If they choose not to enroll in the secondary trial, they will be offered no further trials at that stage of disease (but may be offered other trials in the future).
