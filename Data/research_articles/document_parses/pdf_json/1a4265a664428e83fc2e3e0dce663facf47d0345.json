Hypovolemia was induced by a 600-ml bleed (25% estimated total blood volume). Only phenylephrine was readministered (same protocol). Hypovolemia was reversed by infusing 600 ml hydroxyethyl starch, before readministering phenylephrine and SNP. The relationships between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord tissue oxygenation indices (TOIs) were evaluated. Results: Thoracic and lumbar spinal cord TOIs were approximately 15% and 10% lower, respectively, than the cerebral TOI at similar MAPs. The average relationship between MAP and each TOI showed an autoregulatory pattern, but negative correlations were observed in the cerebral TOI during phenylephrine infusion. A 600-ml bleed lowered each relationship < 5% and subsequent fluid resuscitation did not change the relationship. Individual oxygenation responses to blood pressure indicated that the spinal cord is more pressure-passive than the cerebrum.

We speculate that fluid resuscitation contributes more to the other organs compared with the organs of the CNS and that it might be only minimally effective at increasing spinal cord oxygenation. Based on the relationship between the MAP and each TOI (Fig. 3) , we also speculate that blood transfusion might be more effective than fluid resuscitation and/or elevating blood pressure, but additional studies are required to confirm this possibility.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 666, "end": 670, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 924, "end": 932, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "The impact of hypovolemia and subsequent fluid resuscitation on oxygenation"}, {"text": "An inverse change in TOI, relative to blood pressure, does not fit the classic autoregulation concept but is commonly observed in animals [22] and in clinical patients [7] . In the present study, paradoxical responses were observed in the cerebral TOI in all animals during any stepwise infusions and occurred frequently with an increasing dose of phenylephrine. Although some previous reports have demonstrated that a phenylephrine bolus decreases the cerebral NIRS signal because of a decrease in cardiac output [30, 31] , our findings indicate that paradoxical responses did not occur secondary to a decrease in cardiac output (additional file 1). As a part of the normal physiological response that prevents excessive increases in cerebral blood flow [7, 22] , the rapid changes in perfusion pressure induce arteriolar vasoconstriction as the pressure increases and arteriolar vasodilation as the pressure decreases. The resulting change in the arterial-to-venous blood volume ratio explains the paradoxical response [32] . In our previous study, animals with paradoxical responses in their cerebral TOIs (60% of animals) maintained more stable cerebral oxygenation levels than those that did not show a paradoxical response, suggesting that this response is preferable to autoregulation for controlling appropriate blood flow [22] . The spinal cord has a similar regulatory process, but it may not be as robust as that of the cerebrum. During SNP infusions, paradoxical reactions were observed twice in the thoracic spinal cord, once in the lumbar spinal cord, and never in the cerebrum, indicating that the effectiveness of increasing oxygenation during decreasing blood pressure might be low and should not be expected to help in this case.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 142, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 168, "end": 171, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 514, "end": 518, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 519, "end": 522, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 755, "end": 758, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 759, "end": 762, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1025, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1335, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Paradoxical oxygenation responses to blood pressure changes"}, {"text": "Several limitations of the present study should be addressed. We did not administer phenylephrine and SNP in a crossover design, with each stage occurring sequentially. It is possible, therefore, that the drug infusion order and/or repetitive drug administration during autoregulation assessment could have influenced the subsequent measurements. We induced a wide range of MAPs using phenylephrine and SNP under isoflurane (cerebral vasodilator) anesthesia. However, the results may differ if other vasoactive drugs are used to alter the MAP, either under anesthesia induced by other drugs or without anesthesia. \u03b21 stimulants [33] and norepinephrine [34] in particular can increase cerebral and spinal cord oxygenation compared with phenylephrine. Furthermore, although we did not measure blood gasses during vasoactive drug infusions, it is possible that PaCO 2 changed with hemodynamic changes and affected the autoregulation assessment. We speculate, however, that PaCO 2 was not likely to have changed much because cardiac output did not significantly change, even after 5 \u03bcg kg \u22121 min \u22121 of vasoactive drug infusions, except during phenylephrine infusion after fluid resuscitation (additional file 1). In addition, in the current study, autoregulation was evaluated using only oximetry indices, which were derived straightforwardly from the Spearman's correlation coefficient between the MAP and each TOI. Additionally, the correlation coefficient threshold that was chosen to distinguish between intact and impaired autoregulation was set at 0.36 based on a previous study [4] , but this was chosen arbitrarily. Finally, the present study used NIRS as a surrogate indicator of blood flow, similar to previous studies [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , but NIRS evaluates the oxygen supply-and-demand balance by measuring mixed tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation within the optical field of view. The alteration of blood flow likely changes the TOI, but a given blood flow change does not necessarily cause the same TOI change under conditions where the oxygen supply-and-demand and/or regional blood volume change. In the present study, the oxygen delivery obviously differed between the three conditions. Furthermore, the regional metabolism and/or regional blood volume might have differed during the experiment, due to several interventions (vasoactive drug infusion, hemorrhage, and fluid resuscitation). These findings indicate that the effects of the changes in blood flow on the TOI did not remain constant during the experiment, suggesting that TOI might not accurately reflect blood flow. This might be an unavoidable limitation when NIRS is used as a surrogate indicator of blood flow.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 628, "end": 632, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 652, "end": 656, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1584, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1725, "end": 1728, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1732, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1736, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1740, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1744, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1745, "end": 1748, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Study limitations"}, {"text": "Although our results cannot be directly extrapolated to humans and further clinical studies are required to validate our results, they show that spinal cord autoregulation is not as robust as cerebral autoregulation and that oxygenation in the spinal cord is more pressure-dependent.
