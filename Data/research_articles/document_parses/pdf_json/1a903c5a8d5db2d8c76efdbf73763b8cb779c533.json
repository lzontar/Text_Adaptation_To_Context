While lymphopenia may remain an epiphenomenon, the paucity of T cells may equally be contributing to disease. This is tentatively supported by results showing HIV positive patients with a slight trend toward poorer COVID-19 outcome51,52,53 .

The other major limitation of the current work is the focus on T cells. With the limited phenotype changes observed here, a more comprehensive study of systemic myeloid cell changes in COVID-19 would be justified. Altogether, our study highlights the absence of a strong anti-viral response against SARS-CoV-2 across mild to severe COVID-19 patients, and the elevated presence of anti-inflammatory IL-10-producing regulatory T cells in the severely affected patients. This data suggests that a route to normalization of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity is critical in the attempt to cure these patients. Finally, with the intent to share and exchange knowledge to accelerate research on this pandemic, our data are available on the following open access repository for further investigation: https://flowrepository.org/experiments/2713.MethodsPatient materialHealthy controls and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (qPCR confirmed) were collected as part of the CONTAGIOUS consortium (manuscript in preparation). Briefly, between March 27th and April 17th 2020, healthy volunteers and adult COVID-19 patients were recruited at COVID-19 hospitalization ward at UZ Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) after informed consent.COVID-19 diagnosis was made based on a positive qRT-PCR on respiratory sample and/or CT imaging compatible with SARS-CoV-2 disease. Patients were classified as mild-moderate (WHO clinical score 3-4) or severe (WHO clinical score 5-7) at point of sampling. All procedures were approved by the UZ Leuven Ethical Committee (protocol study number S63881). Blood samples from healthy controls and patients were stored at 15 \u00b0C for 3-6 hours prior to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolation using lymphocyte separation medium (LSM, MP Biomedicals) and freezing in liquid nitrogen. Whole blood count and differential values from the clinical laboratory were obtained concomitantly or within the 24 hours of the blood sample for the flow cytometry analysis.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "), anti-HLA-DR (L243), anti-CD40L (24-31), anti-4-1BB (4B4-1), anti-CD19 (HIB19) (all from BioLegend). Cells were fixed with 2% Formaldehyde (VWR chemicals) and then permeabilized with eBioscience permeabilization buffer according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stained overnight at 4\u00b0C with anti-IFN\u03b3 (4S.B3), anti-IL-6 (MQ2-13A5), anti-IL17a (N49-653), anti-ROR\u03b3t (Q21-559), anti-IL-2 (MQ1-17H12), anti-IL-10 (JES3-9D7), anti-T-bet (4B10), anti-CTLA-4 (BNI3), anti-GATA3 (L50-823) (all from BD Biosciences); anti-IL-4 (MP4-25D2), anti-TNF\u03b1 (Mab11), anti-FOXP3 (206D) (all from BioLegend). Data were collected on BD Symphony (BD Biosciences). A maximum of 5\u00d710 5 events were acquired for each sample. tSNE, FlowSOM and heatmap analysis were performed in R (version 3.6.2).Raw .fcs data were compensated and dead cells and debris were gated out prior to file export.The complete set of FCS files used for the COVID-19 cytokine immune phenotyping has been deposited on FlowRepository and annotated in accordance with the MIFlowCyt standard. These files may be downloaded for further analysis from https://flowrepository.org/experiments/2713.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "Flow cytometry analysisThe concatenated dataset was analyzed through successive FlowSOM clustering and tSNE representation after exporting similar event numbers for each sample per condition group and then subsampling equal event numbers per condition. First, lineage markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD19, CD14) were used to separate leukocyte subsets. Second, activation markers (4-1BB, CCR7, CD25, CD45RA, CTLA-4, HLA-DR, IFN\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17a, PD-1, ROR\u03b3t, T-bet, TNF\u03b1) were used to distinguish phenotypic clusters of each leukocyte subset, again using FlowSOM and tSNE. The characteristics of each identified cluster were assessed by means of histograms and heatmaps.
