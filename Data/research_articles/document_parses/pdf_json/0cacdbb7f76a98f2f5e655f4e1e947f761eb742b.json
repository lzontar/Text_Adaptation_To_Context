The CT showed bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities and consolidation with air bronchogram on the January 12th, 2020. c)The post-treatment CT features of a COVID-19 case. The CT showed apparent absorption on January 26th,2020. Until the patient discharged from the hospital, the ground-glass lesions were not absorbed completely. ",

Therefore, the reasons for prolonged virus shedding may be associated with complications. In a study about MERS-CoV, Hail M et al. find that diabetes was related to prolonged detection of respiratory MERS-CoV RNA. 5 Moreover, Chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to immune cell dysfunction, which may partly explain virus shedding. Therefore, we highlight that the SARS-CoV-2 can present persistently in the patients combined with complications like diabetes and chronic hepatitis B infection, which deserved doctors' specially attention in the treatment of COVID-19.",
