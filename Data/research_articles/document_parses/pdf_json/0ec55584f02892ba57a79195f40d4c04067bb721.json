Common symptoms of this pandemic include fever, cough, troubled 61 breathing, fatigue, body pain and lesions on patient's lungs (Guan et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020). 62 In severe conditions, patients suffer from viral pneumonia, diarrhea, acute cardiac injury and 63 RNAaemia (Huang et al., 2020). Nevertheless, recently few cases of corona virus have been 64 claimed by Chinese government with no observed clinical symptoms (asymptomatic) of COVID-65 19 on May 18, 2020. 66 This pandemic has wrapped whole globe and effected 216 countries including Pakistan. In 67 Pakistan, first 2 cases of Corona virus were confirmed by Federal Health Minister of Pakistan on 68 Feb 26, 2020 in Islamabad and Karachi that arrived to twenty (14 in Sindh, 5 in Gilgit Baltistan, 1 69 in Baluchistan in 12 yr. old boy) till March 12, 2020. History of these patients depicts their recent 70 visit to Iran, London or Syria (Ali, 2020; Saqlain et al., 2020). Pakistan share borders with 71 countries infected with COVID-19 namely, China, and Iran (Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020; Zhu et 72 al., 2020). First coronavirus death from Pakistan was reported in Peshawar on March 18, 2020. Up 73 to now, a total 1,372,825 tests, 225,282 confirmed cases and 4,619 deaths have been reported by 74 NIH, and more than 54% of total confirmed cases of Pakistan are reported from three highly 75 infected cities such as Karachi (70,143 cases), Lahore (41,416 cases) and Peshawar (11,134 cases) 76 till July 4, 2020. To control this pandemic, the government of Pakistan has taken strict actions like 77 screening of passengers traveling from other countries, restrict inter-city transportation, early 78 detection of new cases, quarantine and restrict people mobility (Noreen et al.). In addition, people 79 are advised to use facemasks, hand sanitizers and maintain a distance of one meter to avoid 80 transmission of virus by direct contact (Organization, 2020; Saqlain et al., 2020). 81 In fact, spread of SARS-CoV-2 is attributed to three different routes of its transmission i.e. (a) 82 Aerosol transmission in confined areas, (b) direct inhalation of large respiratory droplets with 83 diameter ranged 5-10 \u03bcm produced by cough or sneeze, (c) Direct contact with surfaces 84 contaminated with virus (Lipsitch et al., 2020). Both, droplet and aerosol are two major routes for 85 transmission of COVID-19 where viral particles spread through breath, sneeze and cough of an 86 infected person. Droplets are large sized mucus or saliva globs (size > 5\u03bcm) with virus 87 encapsulated inside that fall in close proximity of their origin while aerosols are comparatively 88",

Both cough and 90 sneeze emit viral particles in the form of aerosol droplets where cough based particles having 91 diameter < 20 \u03bcm quickly loss water and achieve diameter almost less than half of initial size 92 (Nicas et al., 2005). Aerosol can survive in air for long time and can penetrate into alveolar region 93 of lungs causing viral infection deep in alveolar tissues (Tellier, 2009). The distance travel by 94 sneeze and cough based viral particles depends on the speed of droplet clouds, air flow, 95 temperature and humidity of air i.e. larger droplets travel up to 2m (speed 10m/s) from initial point 96 and up to 1m if emitted at speed of 1m/s while sneeze based droplets travel up to 7-8m (Xie et al., 97 2007). In addition, Bioaerosol also known as droplet nuclei have COVID-19 encapsulated inside 98 particles released from expiratory activities of infected person with size in range of 4 to 8 \u03bcm (i.e. 99 95% < 100 \u03bcm) and their viability lasts for 3 h (Jayaweera et al., 2020). Similarly, droplets of 100 COVID-19 showed trend similar to other SARS viruses in terms of stability and survival on 101 various surfaces where longest duration was reported for glass and plastic surface i.e. 84 h and 72 102 h, respectively while shortest time of droplet's survival is 4 h in case of copper surface (Van 103 Doremalen et al., 2020). Keeping in view its high rate of person to person transmission, series of 104 actions have been recommended by WHO to restrict further spread of COVID-19 (Graham et al., 105 2013; Organization, 2020).",

Meteorological factors effecting the viability 120 and spread of virus associated respiratory infections like SARS involve ambient temperature, 121 humidity, population size and wind speed as reported by recent epidemiological studies (Dalziel 122 et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2005). Stability of droplet and survival of coronavirus is 123 dependent on air temperature as well as humidity (Chan et al., 2011). Recently, Tosepu et al., 124 studied correlation of weather parameters and COVID-19 pandemic and reported positive linear 125 correlation between average temperature and cases of COVID-19 in China and Indonesia (Tosepu 126 et al., 2020; Zhu and Xie, 2020). Wang et al. reported effect of temperature on spread and mortality 127 of COVID-19 while Metz and co-workers examined correlation of humidity with survival of virus 128 (Metz and Finn, 2015; Wang et al., 2020). 129 Keeping in view, the significant correlation of climatological conditions with spread of 130 COVID-19, the current study aimed to reveal correlation of COVID-19 pandemic and 131 meteorological parameters including humidity, temperature, rainfall, wind speed and population 132 size.

Airborne transmission also termed as \"droplet based 244 transmission\" of infectious agent (i.e. COVID-19) is responsible for unexpected escalation of this 245 epidemic around the globe. Aerosols are liquid or solid particle suspension with virus encapsulated 246 inside and pose high threat towards disease spread (Judson and Munster, 2019; Morawska, 2005). 247 The viability and survival of these viral encapsulated droplets is effected by various environmental 248 factors namely temperature variations, wind speed, humidity, and sunlight. Infectivity of virus (i.e. 249 COVID-19; size< 100 nm) encapsulated aerosols depends mainly on stress caused by temperature 250 along with other environmental factors (Kumar and Morawska, 2020; Marthi, 1994). Association 251 of temperature with spread of viral particles has been extensively reported suggesting direct 252 relation of temperature with viability and infectivity rate of different viral infections. Tan et al., 253 reported higher rate of SARS-CoV cases in places of minimum and ambient temperature zone 254 (Tan et al., 2005). Current study suggested that minimum and average air temperature facilitate 255 the spread and transmission of this SARS-CoV-2 embedded inside aerosol particles and has 256 positive correlation with the increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Our findings are in agreement 257 with the previous reports of (Biswas et al., 2014; Harper, 1961; Shaman and Kohn, 2009; Van 258 Doremalen et al., 2013) suggesting more survival rate of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other 259 influenza virus in low temperature zone and corresponding increase in viral pandemic. Best 260 correlation of temperature minimum and temperature average with number of COVID-19 cases in case of Karachi (highly effected city of Pakistan) where evaporation is an 262 important physiochemical process that affect fate of COVID-19 droplets. Recent studies of Tosepu 263 et al., 2020 support our findings that elucidated the significant correlation between average 264 temperature and COVID-19 cases. Similarly, negative correlation observed in case of rainfall and 265 average humidity in current study are also supported by previous studies of Tan et al 2010 and 266 Metz & Finn et al indicating inverse relation of these variables with number of cases (Metz and 267 Finn, 2015; Tan et al., 2005). Negative correlation observed in case of average humidity in current 268 study is consistent with work reported by Chan et al., 2011 suggesting inverse relation among 269 humidity and SARS coronavirus cases (Chan et al., 2011). Impact of climate on the number of 270 COVID-19 cases in various countries has been reported previously by various research groups to 271 explain the statistical interaction (Bashir et al., 2020; \u015eahin, 2020; Tosepu et al., 2020; Zhu and 272 Xie, 2020). Furthermore, studies reported over COVID-19 epidemic from China also suggested 273 strong correlation of coronavirus cases and various climatic parameters particularly, temperature 274 and humidity (Sajadi et al., 2020). 275 Wind speed is another important climatic factor that facilitate the spread of infectious diseases like 276 SARS-CoV, COVID-19 and influenza virus (Bashir et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2006). Positive 277 correlation of wind speed with COVID-19 spread is observed in current study suggesting role of 278 wind for spread of COVID-19 aerosol particles to distance far from their origin. Furthermore, the 279 ROC curve analysis (AUC value range 0.8 to 0.9) also showed good sensitivity of wind speed with 280 number of COVID-19 cases in selected cities of Pakistan. 281 Population size (PS) is reported as major transmittability factor for COVID-19 and showed 282 positive association with COVID-19 epidemic as depicted in Figure 2 while ROC curve analysis 283 also confirmed sensitivity of PS towards spread of COVID-19. These findings are comparable to 284 previous studies of Mehdi et al., that showed strong correlation of PS with number of COVID-19 285 cases (Jahangiri et al., 2020). Role of temperature (i.e. minimum and average), wind speed and 286 population size on COVID-19 spread along with its survival rate and transmission risk on surfaces 287 and air, respectively is well-documented. Therefore, sensitivity analysis of these parameters over 288 transmission rate of COVID-19 in selected cities of Pakistan is crucial for government agencies to 289 devise improved safety measures for survival of people. Owing to significance of PS parameter 290 towards COVID-19 pandemic, more strict actions and control measures are suggested for highly 291 .",
