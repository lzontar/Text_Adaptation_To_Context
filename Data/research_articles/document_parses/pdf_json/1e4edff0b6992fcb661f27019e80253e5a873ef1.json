These include DVT formation as well as pulmonary embolism and stroke. Currently, the exact mechanism as to why COVID-19 patients are at higher risk for thrombotic complications has not been determined. It has been thought to be due to endothelial injury, blood stasis or a hypercoagulable state 1 . To our knowledge this is the first reported case of phlegmasia cerulea dolens in a patient diagnosed with COVID-19.",

He reported a fever and dry cough which began three weeks prior. He stated his symptoms had resolved and he returned to work one day prior to his ED visit. His past medical history was significant for a motor vehicle collision 9 years prior that required multiple surgeries and as a result he developed a DVT and had an IVC filter placed. He had no other significant medical history and did not take any medications. Vitals signs in the ED were: temperature 36.8\uf0b0C, heart rate 85bpm, blood pressure 107/59mm/Hg, respirations 18, pulse oximetry 100% on room air. Physical exam revealed the right lower extremity to be purple and diffusely swollen from the groin to the toes and tender. Pulses were not palpable; however, they were detected via Doppler. His calf was firm, his range of motion was limited due to pain and his capillary refill was delayed. The remainder of his physical examination was unremarkable.",

He was started on heparin in the ED and vascular surgery and the medical intensive care unit (ICU) were consulted. The decision was made to give 50mg of intravenous alteplase. Labs revealed elevations of: D-dimer 17,300ng/mL, c-reactive protein 4.8mg/dL, high-sensitivity troponin-T 23ng/dL, basic natriuretic peptide 612pg/mL, ferritin 813.8ng/mL, fibrinogen 106mg/dL, lactic acid 5.8mEq/L, and IL-6 19pg/mL. Rapid COVID-19 was positive, and PT/PTT/INR were normal. The patient was admitted to the ICU for further management. He was continued on heparin and transitioned to oral anticoagulation and discharged home on hospital day 7.",

Another study compared non-ICU COVID-19 patients to other hospitalized patients and found an increased prevalence in DVT in the COVID-19 patient population 3 .

Other viral infections have been associated with aPL antibodies and thrombotic complications 8 .

One patient of interest in their report also had evidence of ischemia in the lower extremities.
