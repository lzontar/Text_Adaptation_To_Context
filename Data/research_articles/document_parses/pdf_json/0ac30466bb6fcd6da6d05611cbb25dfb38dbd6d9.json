For instance, the average number of COVID-19 tests performed in Chile per 276 day is ~5464, much higher compared to the neighboring South American country, Peru (~671 tests 277 per day) (37). Moreover, the average positivity rate of COVID-19 in Chile is estimated at ~8.8% 278 between April 9 th -April 28 th , 2020 due to the widespread testing in the country. This positivity rate 279 for Chile is consistent with the positivity rates derived from Peru, Denmark, Germany and Canada 280 (6-9%) (43). However, some countries like New Zealand, Australia and South Korea have reached 281 even lower positivity rates (2-3%), with South Korea's large testing capacity combined with a 282 strategy that tracks infected people via cell phones (42, 44). In comparison, Italy and the US have 283 shown much higher positivity rates (15-20%) for COVID-19, indicating overall limited testing in 284 these countries (45, 46).
