Hangzhou, which is the capital of Zhejiang Province, rigorously enforced travel and social-distancing restrictions, home quarantine and infection prevention and control in hospital. The impact of these epidemic control measures on children's physical and mental health is unknown [5, 7] . In this study, we analyzed pediatric visit data during the pandemic in Hangzhou to identify whether restrictions affected children's health.",

We collected data from outpatient healthcare visits between January 1, 2020, and Mar 31, 2020 as well as historical data during the same period of 2019 from the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. This children's hospital, with more than 1900 beds, is the largest comprehensive pediatric medical center in Zhejiang Province and the Chinese National Clinical Research Centre of Child Health. We calculated the rate of each disease in all visiting before and after Jan 25, 2020, and using the change rate (CR = rate in all visiting after outbreak / rate in all visiting before outbreak) and daily visiting number before and after outbreak (DVN before and DVN after ) to show changes of children's health during the pandemic under rigorous epidemic control measures. CR=1 means that the diseases do not changed after the COVID-19 outbreak; CR < 1 means the diseases were suppressed or inhibited during the pandemic; CR > 1means the diseases were stimulated or relative not inhibited during the pandemic. We use the CR< 0.5 to identify inhibited diseases and use CR> 3 to identify stimulated diseases. We also using the daily visiting number before outbreak >3 to filter inhibited diseases and total visiting number after outbreak >120 to filter stimulated diseases to exclude the effects of rare sporadic diseases. Figure 1 , the daily number of pediatric visits were similar to the historical data before the Chinese New Year (spring festival) at Jan 25, 2020. Coincident with COVID-19 restrictions, the daily number of pediatric visits after Jan 25, 2020 fell to about only one quarter compared with the historical data in 2019 due to the measures such as restriction of travel and social distancing , home quarantine and infection prevention and control in the hospital which suspended some services. Figure 2 shows conditions for which visits were most changed. As shown in Figure 2 As shown in Figure 2 , B, there also were conditions for which visits rate increased more than 3-fold during this period. After Jan 25, 2020 19 electrical injuries were seen compared with only 6 in the first three months in 2019.",

Most of common infectious diseases were also suppressed during the periods due to measures as expected. The potential explanation for increased visits by adolescents may be weight gain due to longtime home quarantine and lack of exercise during this period. The high rate of atopic dermatitis and related skin conditions may be related to the lack of sunlight exposure and decreased vitamin D levels during the longtime home quarantine.",
