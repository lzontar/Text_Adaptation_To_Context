We aimed to investigate clinical outcomes of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were readmitted to hospital, in order to identify risk factors for patients discharged and subsequent management of COVID-19 in clinical practice. Clinical outcomes from hospitalised patients with COVID-19 are poor, with a reported mortality of 21% 2 . Age, sex, comorbidities, ethnicity and deprivation have all been shown to correlate with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19, however the outcomes of hospitalised patients once discharged remains unknown [3] [4] [5] .",

Our study has a number of limitations including a moderate sample size, no stratification of COVID-19 severity and a higher than average proportion of patients from BAME backgrounds, reflecting our local demographic. This study was strengthened with the use of local data from a highly pressurised region of the epicentre of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United Kingdom. Further studies, using large datasets with detailed clinical data are urgently needed to investigate both the drivers of and causes for the risk of re-admission, hypoxia and death in re-admissions from COVID-19.",
