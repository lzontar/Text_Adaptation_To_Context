To effectively detect the travel mode for 13 each trip, feature construction is critical in providing useful information. Travel mode-specific 14 knowledge is needed to improve the detection accuracy. In addition to the traditional features used 15 in the literature (e.g. average speed, maximum speed, trip distance, etc.), we also integrated the 16 multi-modal transportation network data to construct innovative features in order to improve the 17 detection accuracy based on network data integration. The wide and deep learning method utilized 18 in this study achieved over 95% prediction accuracy for drive, rail, air, and non-motorized, and 19 over 90% for bus modes on test data. We have applied the trained algorithms on the location dataset 20 to obtain multimodal trip rosters (see Figure 7 that shows raw location data points by different 21 travel modes ",
