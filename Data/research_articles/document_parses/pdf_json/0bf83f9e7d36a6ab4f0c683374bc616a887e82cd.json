Design: Prospective randomized study in which each patient served as his/her own control. Setting: Multidisciplinary neonatal and pediatric ICU. Patients: 8 ventilator dependent premature infants with CLD. Interventions: Salbutamol, 10 gg/kg was given intravenously, and 10-19 h later, twice 100 gg as pressurized aerosol, or vice versa, sequence randomized. The pressurized aerosol was delivered by a metered dose inhaler into a newly developed aerosol holding chamber, integrated into the inspiratory limb of the patient circuit. Respiratory system mechanics were assessed by the single breath occlusion method before and 10 and 60 min after drug administration. Measurements and results.\" Compliance improved significantly after intravenous injection (0.48 +0.18 to 0.67+0.16, p<0.01 and 0.59_+0.23ml/cmH20/kg, NS, (mean_+lSD) and after inhalation (0.46_+0.19 to 0.64_+0.32, p<0.01 and 0.56+0.31 ml/cmHzO/kg, NS). Resistance decreased after i.v. use (0.38_+0.17 to 0.25_+0.11, p<0.001 and 0.25_+0.10 cmHzO/ml/s, NS) and after inhalation (0.35_+0.12 to 0.27+0.09, p<0.01 and 0.28-+0.12 cmHzO/ml/s, NS). Heart rate increased significantly after both routes of application, whereas mean arterial pressure, respirator settings, FIO2, transcutaneous SO2 and capillary PCO 2 did not change. Conclusions.\" Inhaled and intravenous salbutamol improves pulmonary mechanics to the same extent with comparable side effects, and may therefore be used to facilitate weaning from respirators.",

            "text": "A main component in difficulties of weaning ventilatordependent infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or chronic lung disease (CLD) is increased airways resistance which may be due to bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy and bronchospasm [1, 2] . Several authors have shown that these infants improve their bronchopulmonary status after administration of bronchodilators, delivered most often in the form of beta-2-agonists. During these studies the drug has been delivered by inhalation [2-81, subcutaneous injection [91, intravenous infusion [10] or by the oral route [11] . Most authors studying the effect of inhaled beta-2-agonists were using jet nebulization of bronchodilator solution. However, using such a system, aerosol deposition to the lungs has been found to be no more than 1-3% of the original volume of solution [12] [13] [14] . Fuller et al. have shown that by using a metered dose inhaler (MDI) and an aerosol holding chamber or \"spacer\", the dose deposited in the lungs can be increased 4-5 times [13] . We therefore developed a spacer for metered dose aerosol delivery, similar to those used in small asthmatic children [15] . This device can be integrated into the respiratory circuit of an infant ventilator, allowing metered pressurized aerosol delivery during uninterrupted mechanical ventilation. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of this type of beta-2-agonist delivery with the effects of intravenous injection. Changes in mechanics of the respiratory system were assessed by use of the recently introduced single breath occlusion method [16, 17] .",

The extent of improvement of Crs and Rrs did not differ significantly between the i.v. and inhalational group. Overall, we observed an increase in Crs of 28~ at 10 rain after dose, and at 60 min after dose Crs was still 22~ above the pre-values. This rise in Crs is most likely related to bronchodilation of small peripheral airways, resulting in recruitment of new air spaces and thus in an increased tidal volume. (The effect of volume recruitment is nicely demonstrated in Figs. 2a and 2b: with unchanged, respirator settings the expired volume increased from approximately 29 to 39 ml). The overall decrease in Rrs was 29% after 10 min and remained at 27~ below pre-values 60 rain after drug application. Our findings of improved Crs and Rrs are qualitatively in accordance with those of Wilkie et al. [5] and Rotschild et al. [6] who used nebulized salbutamol, Kirpalani et al. who administered the drug by infusion [10] , and Denjean et al. who delivered salbutamol by MDI in a spacer, connected to a manual bag system [8] . In addition, our study demonstrates that salbutamol, delivered by metered pressurized aerosol into a spacer is effective in infants with endotracheal intubation and on mechanical ventilation. The efficacy of the same drug delivery system has recently been reported by Denjean et al. who also studied dose-related bronchodilator response (100, 200 and 400 ~sg) [8] .

            "text": "StcO 2 from 94-97% and an increase of heart rate from 150-180 beats/rain [8] . In summary, although identical doses of inhaled salbutamol were used, the patients in Denjean's series showed a higher beta-mimetic response than our infants. This could be due to a higher amount of drug reaching the lower airways and lungs, related to the hand ventilation of the spacer or other technical, physiological or medical reasons. With respect to gas exchange, we have been able to show that with unchanged ventilator settings and improved respiratory mechanics, PcapCO2 tended to be low-er 60 rain after salbutamol in our patients (NS). The reason for not reaching a significant level might be due to the fact that the effect of improved ventilation was offset by an increase in metabolism, i.e. CO2-production. Newth et al. have recently been able to show that inhaled salbutamol leads to a remarkable increase in oxygen consumption in anesthetized monkeys [19] . In contrast to the results of Denjean et al. [8] we did not observe improved StcO 2 in our patients after salbutamol application, on the contrary StcO 2 tended to be lower after i.v. injection (NS). The effects of beta-agonist bronchodilators on oxygenation in patients with hyperreactive small airways and areas of atelectatic and overexpanded pulmonary parenchyma are difficult to predict: although alveolar ventilation improves, ventilation-perfusion mismatch may increase due to raised cardiac output and pulmonary vasodilation [20] . With regard to clinical application every method (i.e. jet nebulizer, MDI with a spacer and intravenous injection) has its advantages and drawbacks. Application by jet nebulizer with hand ventilation [5] is time consuming (10-15 min) , an oxygen/air mixing device is required, cooling of gases might be important and there is some danger of barotrauma, unless special precautions are taken to avoid excessive pressures by hand-bagging. In addition the dose of deposited drug in the lung has been shown to be small when jet nebulizing systems are used [12, 13] . In contrast, using MDI together with a spacer spares time and allows better deposition of drug in the lungs [13] . Similar systems have been used by Grigg et al. using cromoglycate in intubated infants [14] , O'Callaghan et al. who examined deposition of inhaled steroids in a rabbit model [21] and Denjean et al. who administered salbutamol in ventilator-dependent infants [8] . In addition Arnon et al. have shown in a test-lung model that the combination of MDI and spacer appears to be an extremly effective way of delivering aerosols (budenoside) to ventilated infants [22] . On the other hand the spacer is somewhat clumsy, particularly in closed incubators with limited space. In addition, if uninterrupted mechanical ventilation is desired, a respirator is needed in which the flow through the patient circuit can be set to zero during expiration in order to avoid unnecessary washout of the aerosol holding chamber. A third possibility of drug application is the intravenous injection, for which, however, venous access is needed, and systemic side effects (i.e. tachycardia) are more likely to occur (Table 3 ).",
