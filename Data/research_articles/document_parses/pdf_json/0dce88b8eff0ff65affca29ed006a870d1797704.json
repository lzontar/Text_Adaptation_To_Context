Four co-morbidity cases presented with a CD4 count less than 200/\u00b5L, including two severe cases and two mild cases (All recovered at the end of the study). Although P12 presented with a low CD4 count, he did not even show any symptoms of COVID-19 or any abnormality in the radiograph. This may indicate that low CD4 count did not inevitably lead to death under HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. On the contrary, the two deaths occurred in cases who had a relatively high CD4 count (350/\u00b5L and 695/\u00b5L). This finding is consistent with a previous study, which reported one AIDS/COVID-19 patient who presented a low CD4 count (13/\u00b5L) and recovered finally 2 . Considering that",

Living with HIV/AIDS also played a role in leading to comorbidities prior to admission, such as lymphoma and opportunistic infection (pneumocystis pneumonia, PCP). Reports from laboratory examinations at admission showed leukopenia in six cases and lymphopenia in discrepant six cases. Although the exact immune-pathogenesis of the decrease of lymphocytes in peripheral blood is unclear, lymphopenia is also reported as a frequent presentation in HIV negative COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases 5,7 . The pattern of immune cells in AIDS/COVID-19 patients showed minor differences from that of overall COVID-19 patients 8 . However, patients' CD4 count, HIV-VL, and inflammatory cytokines were not tested on the admission, which prevented us from knowing more about the immune status at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PLHWA. Another limitation should be mentioned that only one ART na\u00efve COVID-19 case was enrolled in our investigation, although knowing the COVID-19 prognosis in ART na\u00efve patients is critical. However, together with the case series published earlier 3 , the previous immune status and the clinical course of all the patients in this study still help to sum up some experiences in treating COVID-19 in PLWHA.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on people around the world, including PLWHA, and continues to grow.
