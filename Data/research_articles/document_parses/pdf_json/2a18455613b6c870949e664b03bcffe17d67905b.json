We propose that these interactions facilitate a role for CNTD1 as a stop-go regulator during prophase I, ensuring accurate and complete crossover formation before allowing metaphase progression and the first meiotic division.",

Synapsis is achieved by the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC), whose assembly and status defines the five sub-stages of prophase I. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the formation of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) throughout the genome in early leptonema (Baudat et al., 2000; Keeney et al., 1997 , 1999 , Robert et al., 2016a , 2016b Romanienko and Camerini-Otero, 2000) . In the mouse, 200-300 DSBs are generated and processed through common intermediate repair steps to yield either non-crossover or crossover events . While the majority of DSBs ($90% in the mouse) repair as non-crossovers in zygonema and early pachynema, the crossovers that form during pachynema establish the inter-homolog tethers that allow for their correct segregation at MI (Cole et al., 2014) . Thus, the correct timing, frequency, and distribution of crossovers ensures that at least one crossover per pair is generated (the obligate crossover) (Jones, 1984) , that crossovers are maintained at the expense of non-crossovers (crossover homeostasis) (Cole et al., 2012; Martini et al., 2006) , and that the formation of one crossover prevents the formation of nearby crossovers (interference) (Jones and Franklin, 2006) . How these rules are enforced within the realm of DSB repair and shape crossover and non-crossover decisions remains unclear.",

            "text": "In the mouse, crossovers can form by at least two mechanisms. The class I (ZMM) pathway is responsible for the majority of crossovers and uses the DNA mismatch repair endonuclease MutLg, a heterodimer of MLH1 and MLH3 (Edelmann et al., 1996; Lipkin et al., 2002) . MLH1 and MLH3 co-localize along chromosome cores at a frequency of $23 foci at pachynema (Baker et al., 1996) , reflecting 90%-95% of the final crossover count in male meiosis (Lipkin et al., 2002; Svetlanov et al., 2008) . The distribution of MutLg foci during pachynema in mouse spermatocytes is interference dependent and satisfies the requirement for the obligate crossover (Broman et al., 2002) . Loss of either component of MutLg results in infertility due to the loss of most crossovers, leading to arrest before metaphase I in males and meiosis I non-disjunction in females (Baker et al., 1996; Edelmann et al., 1996; Kolas et al., 2005; Lipkin et al., 2002) . The remaining 5%-10% crossovers are generated by the class II MUS81-EME1-dependent pathway. These class II crossovers are interference independent, but cannot account for all of the class I-independent crossovers since the mutation of both Mlh3 and Mus81 leads to the persistence of 1-3 chiasmata (Holloway et al., 2008) .

Initially, a subset ($150) of these repair intermediates accrue the MutSg heterodimer of MSH4 and MSH5 (Edelmann et al., 1999; Kneitz et al., 2000) , an event called crossover licensing. Of these, only 23-26 MutSg sites subsequently become loaded with MutLg to form class I crossovers, while the remaining sites are repaired either through the class II crossover pathway or via the formation of non-crossovers (Cole et al., 2014; Holloway et al., 2008; Milano et al., 2019) . The mechanism by which MutSg becomes further selected by the accrual of MutLg has been called crossover designation, leading to the idea that crossover homeostasis is imposed sequentially by the association of these pro-crossover MutS/MutL proteins (Cole et al., 2012; Hunter, 2015; Moens et al., 2002) .",

Loss of COSA1 in worms results in a failure to accumulate MSH-5 at DSB repair intermediates and the loss of all crossovers (Yokoo et al., 2012) . The loss of CNTD1 in the mouse results in similar meiotic failure characterized by persistently elevated early crossover factors through pachynema and failure to load crossover designation factors such as MutLg, the crossover site-associated cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2), and the putative ubiquitin E3 ligase HEI10 . In the present study, we sought to further elucidate the function of CNTD1 in driving crossover formation. We generated a dual epitope-tagged allele of Cntd1 (Cntd1 FH ) to facilitate the tracking of CNTD1 protein in mouse spermatocytes and to enable the analysis of the CNTD1 interactome. We find that CNTD1 localizes to sites that are loaded with MutLg, but surprisingly, the predominant form of CNTD1 in spermatocytes lacks the ability to interact with known meiotic CDKs or crossover factors. Instead, CNTD1 drives crossover designation and cell-cycle progression through distinct interactions with key regulatory complexes involved in facilitating the activity of MutLg (namely replication factor C [RFC]) and those involved in modulating cell-cycle progression through the ubiquitylation of critical cell-cycle regulators (namely CDC34-containing SKP1-Cullin-Fbox [SCF] complex).",

Western blotting (WB) of whole testis extracts from Cntd1 +/+ , Cntd1 FH/+ , and Cntd1 FH/FH adult matched littermates demonstrated the presence of the protein specifically in mice bearing the Cntd1 FH allele, but revealed a smaller-than-expected band at $30 kDa, present only in the testis (Figures 1B and S2B, arrow) . Prior characterization of the Cntd1 locus described the use of a start codon near the beginning of exon 3 (NCBI: DS033671), which would produce a 27.5-kDa endogenous protein and a 29.7-kDa tagged protein, matching the size we observe by WB ( Figures 1A, 1B , and S2A). We call this protein product CNTD1 short form. Since a non-specific band around the predicted size (40 kDa) for CNTD1 FH is observed, we undertook immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by WB using two independent anti-HA antibodies to determine whether a form of Cntd1 FH exists that is obscured by this non-specific band. We observe the enrichment of the smaller 30-kDa band in the IP fraction ( Figure 1C , arrow), loss of the non-specific band at $40 kDa, and no additional specific bands ( Figure 1C) .",

We also considered whether the CNTD1 full-length protein could migrate smaller than predicted by WB. However, when we expressed constructs encoding the FLAG-HA-tagged full-length and short forms of CNTD1, we detected both forms of the protein by WB using an anti-HA antibody ( Figure 1E ). The CNTD1 short form migrates at the expected 30 kDa size. Thus, anti-HA antibodies can detect both full-length and short-form CNTD1, but they detect only the latter in mouse spermatocyte extracts, leading us to conclude that the major CNTD1 variant found in mouse testis is the short-form 30-kDa protein.",

Second, we observe greater variability in the N-terminal portion of the protein upstream of this methionine ( Figure 1F ). This manifests as splice variants within species that exhibit multiple annotated isoforms ( Figure 1F ). Splicing always preferentially modifies the N terminus, leading to truncations that, at a minimum, constitute the short form of the protein. The koala ortholog exemplifies this pattern of variability ( Figure 1F ). It is important to note that one species, the American alligator, has only a single short isoform described that begins at the alternative methionine start site ( Figure S3 , bottom row).

Truncation of the N terminus in the CNTD1 short form removes the first 85 amino acids, encompassing the majority of cyclin homology region 1 ( Figure 1A ).

The CNTD1 short form, however, fails to interact with any of the tested CDKs ( Figure 1G , bottom half). To determine whether CDK2 and CDK4 interactions with CNTD1 exist in vivo, we immunoprecipitated CNTD1 FH from mouse testis using the anti-HA antibody and probed with antibodies against CDK2 and CDK4. IP with anti-HA antibodies failed to enrich for either CDK2 or CDK4 ( Figure 1H ), which is consistent with the conclusion that the CNTD1 short form is the predominant isoform in mouse and lacks the ability to interact with key prophase I CDKs.",

Using the same anti-HA antibody that we used in WB, which detected only the CNTD1 FH short orm, we observed discrete foci of CNTD1 FH at pachynema, distributed along the cores of the SC in testis sections and spread meiotic spermatocytes ( Figures   2C-2L ). For chromosome spreads, we used colocalization with the SC protein SYCP3 to assess the prophase I stage, providing a temporal profile of CNTD1 FH through prophase I. In leptonema, we observed diffuse nuclear staining of CNTD1 FH , which accumulates along the SC in zygonema, with some foci observed along the SC (Figures 2D and 2E ). Throughout pachynema, the diffuse nuclear staining of CNTD1 FH is no longer observed, being replaced by discrete foci along the SC at a frequency reminiscent of MutLg numbers (Figures 2F and J-L; Baker et al., 1996; Lipkin et al., 2002) . In early pachynema, localization of CNTD1 FH is observed in two distinct patterns: one population of cells has yet to accumulate any CNTD1 FH while a second population of cells shows increasing focus frequency ( Figure 2I ). By mid-pachynema, the focus frequency for CNTD1 FH is more homogeneous, at 27 \u00b1 2.7, and persisting at 26.5 \u00b1 3.3 in late pachynema ( Figure 2I ). By diplonema, the diffuse nuclear staining pattern resumes, but clear foci of HA signal remain associated with the SC ( Figures 2G and 2H ), and is lost by diakinesis.",

Meiotic chromosome spreads were prepared from 46 fractions and scored based upon SC morphology and presence of the phosphorylated histone variant gH2AFX . The purity of STA-PUT-enriched fractions for each germ cell stage reached 67% leptonema, 45% zygonema, 89% pachynema, 79% diplonema, and 98% sperm across different fractions ( Figure 3A ). WB performed against proteins from the STA-PUT cell fractions resulted in a dynamic profile of protein levels using a battery of antibodies against meiosis regulators ( Figure 3A ), all compared to the dynamic expression of CNTD1 as detected by the HA tag. Detailed protein dynamics are delineated below, describing the data in Figure 3A .

Of these, we prioritized our continued analysis based on protein interactors that may explain crossover designation, cell-cycle progression, and the recent understanding of the role of post-translational modifications in driving these functions during meiosis (Ahuja et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2015; Reynolds et al., 2013) . Based on these criteria, two specific complexes were of particular interest (Figure 3B) . First, CNTD1 FH interacts with components of the RFC complex, which in somatic cells acts in the recruitment/activation of the DNA mismatch repair pathway (Bowen and Kolodner, 2017; Constantin et al., 2005; Kadyrov et al., 2006) . Second, CNTD1 FH interacts with many proteins belonging to the ubiquitylation pathway ( Figures 3B and S6B ), including components of the SKP1-Cullin-Fbox (SCF; reviewed in Lee and Diehl, 2014) , namely the E2 conjugating enzyme CDC34 (Figures 3B and S6B). RFC Complex RFC is a pentameric complex, consisting of RFC1-5, which loads proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA during DNA replication ( Figure 3B ; Majka and Burgers, 2004) . RFC and PCNA have been implicated in the activation of MutL endonucleases (Bowen and Kolodner, 2017; Constantin et al., 2005; Kadyrov et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2015) . Our MS data revealed CNTD1 interaction with RFC3 and RFC4 (Table S1 ), which was confirmed by anti-HA-IP followed by WB using anti-RFC3 and RFC4 antibodies ( Figure 4A ). WB analysis on whole-testis lysate from Cntd1 +/+ and Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice demonstrated no difference in the total protein levels of RFC3, RFC4, or PCNA ( Figure 4B ). In STA-PUT fractions from Cntd1 +/+ testes, we detected RFC3 and RFC4 protein in fractions enriched for leptonema through pachynema cells, while PCNA persists until diplonema (Figure 4C) . In STA-PUT fractions from Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 testes, RFC3 and RFC4 protein levels were decreased in lanes representing mostly pachytene cells, compared to similar lanes in WBs from STA-PUT-sorted Cntd1 +/+ fractions ( Figure 5A ). Immunofluorescence staining on spread meiotic chromosomes using antibodies against RFC3 and RFC4 revealed faint nuclear staining and focus formation along regions of the synaptonemal complex in pachynema. In pachytene spermatocytes from Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males, the overall nuclear staining of RFC3 and RFC4 was reduced, as was the specific number of RFC3/4 foci along autosomal synaptonemal complexes compared with that observed in Cntd1 FH/FH cells ( Figures 5B-5E ). By contrast, PCNA immunofluorescence staining in pachytene spermatocytes from Cntd1 FH/FH males revealed diffuse nuclear staining in addition to discrete foci of PCNA along chromosome cores, some reminiscent of the patterning observed when staining for class I crossover proteins ( Figure 5F ). By contrast, PCNA staining in pachytene spermatocytes from Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males was more intense across the entire nucleus, including the signal observed along the synaptonemal complex ( Figure 5G ).",

However, the staining intensity in individual sub-stages of prophase I appears persistently more robust in spermatocytes from Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males than in wild type (Figures 5J and 5K, right-hand gray panels, S7). These results demonstrate the robust localization of RFC and PCNA in late-stage primary spermatocytes, distinct from their expected staining in cells undergoing DNA replication (e.g., proliferating spermatogonia). In this regard, our data suggest that RFC and PCNA may play a role in DSB repair during meiosis that is analogous to their role in DNA repair in somatic cells in regard to MutL complexes (Majka and Burgers, 2004) .",

Because of this interaction, we asked whether CDC34 levels were similarly altered in crossover mutants for genes acting downstream of CNTD1. CDC34 protein levels were reduced in Mlh1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice to a similar extent as those observed in Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 4D ). The WB profile of CDC34 protein across STA-PUT fractions from Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males, where prophase I cells are present but sperm is absent, showed a similar drastic reduction in CDC34 protein ( Figure 5K ). Therefore, the lack of CDC34 protein is a consequence of a failure to form a competent crossover complex and subsequent lack of later-stage cells.",

WEE1 was decreased in protein extracts from testes of Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males compared with Cntd1 FH/FH males, whereas CDK1 and CDK2 protein levels were not significantly altered Figure 4E ). The nuclear localization of WEE1, however, is observed throughout prophase I and remains elevated at diplonema in spermatocytes of Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males rather than diminishing as in wild-type testes ( Figure 6D ). WEE1 inhibits CDK1 and CDK2 activity by phosphorylation on tyrosine 15 (Gould and Nurse, 1989; Gu et al., 1992; Krek et al., 1992; Morla et al., 1989) , but phospho-specific antibodies against tyrosine 15 of CDK1 and CDK2 did not reveal any significant change in whole-testis lysate from Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males compared to Cntd1 FH/FH animals ( Figure 4E ). Therefore, to assess prophase I stage-specific changes in WEE1 phosphorylation, we stained testis sections from Cntd1 FH/FH and Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males using a pan-CDK phospho-tyrosine 15 antibody ( Figures  6E and 6F) . We observed strong cytoplasmic staining of early prophase I Cntd1 FH/FH spermatocytes that is lost by diplonema ( Figure 6E ). By contrast, we observed the retention of the cytoplasmic pan-CDK phospho-tyrosine 15 signal throughout prophase I in testis sections of Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males ( Figure 6F ). CDK1 and CDK2 staining in Cntd1 FH/FH cells appear to be dynamic between the cytoplasm and nucleus throughout prophase I ( Figures 6G and 6I ). In early prophase I, CDK1 and CDK2 are distributed between both cellular compartments, but by diplonema show strong nuclear staining. By contrast, staining of CDK1 and CDK2 in testis sections from Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males reveals much less-intense nuclear signal with only faint cytoplasmic staining and no localization in the nucleus by diplonema ( Figures  6H and 6J) . These data suggest that SCF is misregulated in Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males relative to Cntd1 FH/FH , leading to decreased CDC34 levels. This in turn results in increased WEE1 + cells within the seminiferous epithelium of Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 males coupled with a decrease in CDK1 and CDK2 staining in the nucleus of late prophase I cells and a persistence of inhibited CDKs in the cytoplasm ( Figures 6G-6L ). We postulate that the insufficient degradation of WEE1 arising from the loss of CNTD1 and CDC34 directly contributes to the failure of cell-cycle progression.",

The present article shows that CNTD1 FH foci are found in a similar distribution and frequency to those of MutLg, often co-localizing with this complex. Approximately 1-5 MLH1-independent foci exist per cell, reminiscent of the number of crossovers expected to form through MutLg-independent mechanisms (Holloway et al., 2008) . Thus, we propose that CNTD1 localizes to all nascent crossover sites, not only those destined to form MutLg-dependent crossovers. We do not find any discrete CNTD1 FH signal before pachynema, suggesting that CNTD1 accumulates at a time when class I and II crossovers are becoming designated.",

Two lines of evidence support this conclusion: (1) migration of CNTD1-FH on WB and the corroborating localization of the tagged protein on meiotic chromosome cores in prophase I (Figures 1B-1E and 2C-2L) and (2) multiple anti-HA antibodies can detect both full-length and short forms of the protein when expressed in yeast, and they migrate relative to their predicted size, indicating that if a full-length protein did exist in spermatocytes, we would be able to detect it. The CNTD1 short-form protein lacks the first cyclin homology domain and is incapable of associating directly with any known CDKs. Our MS and IP-WB data, however, show that the CNTD1 short form can interact with the regulators of CDK activity, thereby providing an indirect mechanism by which progression through the cell cycle can be modulated following appropriate crossing over. We cannot exclude the possibility that the CNTD1 short form maintains some cyclin-like functions since it still contains two cyclin homology domains with predicted structural similarity to cyclin A. In fact, these cyclin domains may be critical for protein translocation between the cytoplasm and the nucleus at defined stages during prophase I, as observed in CNTD1 short-form staining ( Figure S4 ) and as has previously been shown for cyclin domain-containing proteins (Kong et al., 2000) . We also cannot rule out that the full-length version of CNTD1 exists in low, undetectable levels or that it is more predominant in females. In testis from male mice, however, we find only a single band migrating at a size that corresponds with the epitope-tagged short form of CNTD1, while the same antibodies used on chromosome spread preparations localize exclusively to sites that correspond with nascent crossovers and mostly correspond to MutLg localization.",

While RFC and PCNA are required for the activity of human and yeast MutLa in vitro (Constantin et al., 2005; Kadyrov et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2015) , yeast MutLg displays activity independent of these proteins (Manhart and Alani, 2016) . However, more recent studies (currently in preprint form) have demonstrated that RFC and PCNA activate mammalian MutLg (Cannavo et al., 2020; Kulkarni et al., 2020) . While no information exists to describe the interaction between RFC and PCNA complexes in mammalian germ cells in vivo, it is likely, given the observations from mitotic, biochemical, and in vitro assays, that these complexes interact, potentially in a DNA substrate-specific manner. Moreover, our previous studies have demonstrated the importance of PCNA in meiotic prophase I in the mouse (Roa et al., 2008) . In the present work, we observe a decreased cellular signal of RFC4 but a stronger nuclear staining pattern of PCNA throughout prophase I in testis sections from Cntd1 mutants. On meiotic spread preparations, PCNA localization along the SC increases in the absence CNTD1, coincident with the decreased localization of RFC3/4. Previous characterizations of Cntd1 GT/GT male mice revealed normal prophase I progression before crossover formation and normal DSB formation and repair kinetics with no persistent DSBs observed . The progression of spermatocytes through to pachynema of prophase I in testis from Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 animals ( Figures 5 and 6) indicates that the kinetics of early DSB induction and repair are largely normal. The persistent strong nuclear and SC staining of PCNA that we observe within Cntd1 null mutants is therefore not a consequence of the failure to undergo appropriate early DNA repair events. This is further supported by diakinesis spreads that show decreased bivalent formation in Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 animals, but not fragmented chromosomes forming as a result of unrepaired DSBs. Based on these observations, we propose that the persistent PCNA signal (and not RFC) is not related to ongoing DNA synthesis associated with meiotic recombination in Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 animals, but is instead a prelude to active crossover formation, with CNTD1-RFC-PCNA being required to localize proteins at the correct location and time to achieve class I crossovers. New observations from the Cejka and Hunter labs support our observations and our conclusion that PCNA-RFC interactions facilitate MutLg-stimulated crossover formation (Cannavo et al., 2020; Kulkarni et al., 2020) .",

Although we have not identified the partner E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) that functions with CDC34, previous findings in Xenopus identified the cell-cycle kinase WEE1 as a specific target of CDC34 (Michael and Newport, 1998) . WEE1 exerts inhibitory effects through the phosphorylation of CDK1 and CDK2, and its removal enables mitotic cell-cycle progression (Gu et al., 1992; Morgan, 1995; Welburn et al., 2007) . We find a similar mechanism functioning during meiotic prophase I in the male mouse. In this context, WEE1 phosphorylation of CDK1 maintains MPF in an inactive state and prevents cyclin B-CDK1-induced progression to metaphase. Cntd1 null mutants show a decreased CDC34 signal, a retention of WEE1 in the nucleus throughout prophase I, continued inhibitory phosphorylation of its targets within the cytoplasm, and a consequent failure to localize CDK1 and CDK2 within the nucleus of late-stage prophase I cells. However, the total WEE1 signal from the testis of Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 animals showed a decrease compared with that of Cntd1 FH/FH animals. While we cannot fully explain this difference, the lack of post-meiosis I cells in the Cntd1 \u00c0/\u00c0 animals or the difference in total protein found in the cytoplasmic versus nuclear compartments may account for the difference in total protein. These observations strongly argue that CNTD1 acts upstream of WEE1 through association with CDC34 and relieves the (C-J) Immunofluorescence using antibodies against WEE1 (C and D) and its targets, including pan-tyrosine15 (E and F), CDK1 (G and H), and CDK2 (I and J), on formalin-fixed testis sections of Cntd1 FH/FH (left column panels C, E, G, and I) and To clarify the connection between CNTD1 and cell-cycle progression, we devised a strategy to investigate how CNTD1-mediated WEE1 inhibition could perturb the completion of prophase I. To test this in an in vitro short-term culture system, we used the small-molecule WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib in conjunction with the metaphase-to-anaphase inhibitor nocodazole. Only with combined treatment using both drugs were we able to observe the inhibition of metaphase I progression, indicative of an induced SAC, and such a result was observed in spermatocytes from both wild-type and Cntd1 mutant males. These results demonstrate a requirement for WEE1 degradation/inhibition to allow metaphase I entry and thus to facilitate progression to the metaphase-anaphase boundary ( Figure 7D ).",

While these activities are distinct, the localization of both CNTD1 FH and CDK2 at crossover sites, together with the fact that CDK1 and CDK2 are both downstream targets of the SCF complex, support the integrated regulation by CNTD1 of the processes governing crossover formation and cell-cycle progression. Despite the persistent colocalization of CNTD1 and CDK2 in recombination foci throughout the $7 days of mouse pachynema, we cannot find any evidence of a physical interaction between these two proteins in vivo. Instead, our findings show that CNTD1 interacts with key players of crossover formation and cell-cycle progression and that the loss of CNTD1 leads to the misregulated localization of these factors. We propose that CNTD1 functions to coordinate these processes, indirectly affecting the activity of cell-cycle regulators and implicating CNTD1 as a stop-go regulator mechanism, monitoring crossover formation akin to a crossover-specific checkpoint, which may also be activated by the cellular machinery downstream of CNTD1. CNTD1 interactions with RFC in the context of the RAD17-RFC complex, an established cell-cycle checkpoint mediator (Ohashi and Tsurimoto, 2017) , could provide additional crosstalk and control of these pathways ( Figure 7E ). While our findings have immediate implications for the timing and control of prophase I in the male mouse, the dual nature of CNTD1 pathway interactions that we have uncovered here and the potential of variable splicing at the N terminus implicate CNTD1 as a regulatory nexus throughout the animal kingdom.",

While we addressed the vast majority of points raised by the reviewers, due to our inability to undertake additional experiments, we have identified three limitations to our study. First, while we have identified a short-form CNTD1 protein by WB, a reviewer suggested a modified protein extraction technique to identify whether an additional CNTD1 form could be observed. Second, while we have shown interactions of CNTD1 with components of the RFC complex and CDC34 by unbiased (MS) and biased (IP-WB) methods, because of the importance of these interactions, a reviewer asked for further confirmation of interaction by other biochemical methods. Finally, reviewers asked us to build on data in Figure 4 and data within Figure 7 with the inclusion of drug treatment on an additional meiotic crossover mutant (Mlh1 \u00c0/\u00c0 ).

Once integrated, the region including the gRNA scaffold was PCR amplified to include the T7 promoter. The PCR fragment was used to in an in vitro transcription reaction using the Ambion MEGAshortscript T7 Transcription Kit (AM1354). Single-stranded DNA homology donor containing 78 nucleotides of homology upstream of the guide sequence, FLAG and HA epitopes separated by a leucine (generating a HindIII restriction site) and 66 nucleotides of homology downstream of the Cntd1 stop codon was generated by IDT. gRNA, DNA donor and Cas9 mRNA was injected into 146 C57BL/6J x FVB F1 zygotes. 119 two-cell embryos were surgically implanted in 5 female recipients leading to the birth of 46 founder mice. PCR screening identified 7 founders with DNA integrated at the locus, 3 of which were the correct size. Sequencing revealed one founder mouse having the tags integrated in the correct frame.
