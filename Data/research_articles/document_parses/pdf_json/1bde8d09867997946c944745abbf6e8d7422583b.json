Besides humbly admitting this to be, first of all, the work of doctors, nurses, virologists, biologists and epidemiologists, not to mention the engineers who design medical and life-saving devices, each of us wonders what technical tools among ours might either help the fight, or at least teach something about how the pandemic appears to work. Speaking for myself, I am doing some job on the biomathematics of epidemics partly for scientific curiosity and intellectual challenge, and partly (I'm sure) just to do something in contact with what is happening out there, be it the epical tragedy or the difficult clash against the virus. The antidote my research is looking for is, at least, the one against the feeling of personal powerlessness.",

The fact attracting my attention, among the various results reported, was the apparent good performance, in fitting the contagion data, of the law C (t) solving the Generalized Richards Model (GRM) [2] ; this is a modification of the logistic equation\u010a",

The Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) (2) has been largely and succesfully employed in epidemiology, so there is no real surprise in its applicability to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, as theorists usually do, I wonder which \"first principle meaning\" should be given to those powers p and \u03b1 in (2) . In the literature, those parameters appear to be mostly guessed/adapted empirically, in order to fit the experimental curve C (t) a posteriori, once the epidemic is completely developed. Some study noticeably put the (p, \u03b1) values in relationship with the \"microscopic contagion dynamics\" [3] : it is shown that these constants depend on the geography of contagion (whether the epidemic develops in regions with or without clusters of population and communications, like towns of various size, or not) and on the sociology of contagion (in the case of HIV, for instance, whether this takes place via sexual intercourse, or via needle sharing); these \"microscopic conditions\" appears to be what gives the contagion networks a different topology. Recently, the specific study [4] on the COVID-19 outbreak argued how the scale-free complex clusterization of contagion events could motivate a fractional kinetics for C (t); I am myself involved, together with Giuseppe Consolini, in a study about fractional ODEs possibly solved by the COVID-19 C (t) best fit in Italy [5] .",

One of the most important assumptions of the logistic equation, and of all ODEs regulating the kinetics of population growth, is the so called mass hypothesis [6, 7] : one assumes that the mixing of individuals is such, that all the microscopic actions represented in the ODE are taken (on the average) by all the elements of that population. This, roughly, gives rise to integer powers of population variables in the ODEs. In a certain sense, one might expect equation (2) to be a consequence of mass hypothesis violation by the statistics of the microscopic actions (contagion events), of which it represents a mean field description.",

The locus E \"where infected humans live\" must be understood as a subset of the place where people live, work and move, i.e., of the network of inhabited centers and the links connecting them. Let us put dim E = \u03bd (consider this is far from being easily defined).

Once this E act is identified, its \"size\" should be expressed as a function of the \"size\" of the whole E, so to be able to write the expression C act (C): provided things work as in the herd behaviour case, i.e. provided E act is a non-space-filling subset of E, hence of Hausdorff dimension smaller than dim E, one may state",

As a fantasy, we could say dim H = \u03c1 \u2264 2, since we can at most occupy the 2-dimensional surface of a country: so E \u2286 H will mean \u03bd \u2264 \u03c1 < 2. An indication about dim H, in agreement with the arguments here, may be found in [12] , for example. When one goes from dim E = \u03bd to the value of dim E act , things become more complicated, because now we have to consider not only the distribution and behaviour of humans, but also the \"contagion dynamics\", a contribution given by the nature of the virus. For COVID-19, the contagion seems to take place via rather close contact, so that particles of the breath of an infected person are received by the susceptible individual: one may imagine to select E act considering the sub-locus of E of the close contacts of the single individual, i.e. possibly the \"network of personal relationships\" and \"of casual encounters\". Possibly, this will give dim E act = \u00b5 \u2264 \u03bd, and hence p. Similar considerations will lead to figuring out what \u03b1 could be.",
