Another important source of the heterogeneity is the type of reproductive number calculated. A basic reproductive number is usually produce higher value as it is applied in the situation where no restriction was applied to prevent new infections [22] . In comparison, both net reproductive number (\u0734 \u123b , and time dependent reproductive number (\u0734 \u0be7 \u123b are calculated for situation where restriction(s) was/were applied to control new infection [25, 47] . Therefore, these provide lower estimated value which supports our narrative synthesis. However, higher timedependent reproductive number than basic reproductive number that found in summary analysis is conflicting with the usual understanding. However, studies presented timedependent reproductive were conducted for Diamond Princes Cruise Ship in Japan Italy, France, Germany, and Spain where very large outbreak of COVID-19 reported mainly for delayed in taking preventive measures.
