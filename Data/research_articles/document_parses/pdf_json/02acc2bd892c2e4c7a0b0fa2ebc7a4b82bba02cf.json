            "text": "T he severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic is currently projected to infect up to 50%-60% of the American population. 1 High disease transmission rates, scarcity of personal protective equipment, and frequent aerosol-generating procedures such as tracheal intubation combine to make occupational exposure likely for many health care workers. Those at highest risk include anesthesiologists, emergency medicine physicians, intensive care physicians, nurse anesthetists, and emergency medical technicians. 2 More than 3300 health care workers in China have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 20% of responding health care workers in Italy have been infected. 3 As the pandemic spreads, these health care workers are subjecting their families to this risk, which is of particular concern with family members who are older, have chronic illness, or are otherwise at high risk for complications from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). 4 Alternatively, some are choosing to move out of the home. 5 Separation from family is not possible for many, and even when it is possible, places a significant emotional burden on both the health care worker and the family members during stressful times when social support systems are most needed. 6 Remaining at home without proper isolation from household members also contributes to community spread of the virus through family contacts, further propagating the pandemic. 7 By creating a temporary isolation wall consisting of a framed viewing and access window and plastic sheeting, a section of a home (eg, a bedroom with adjacent bathroom) can be effectively isolated to contain droplet bioburden and avoid contamination of the remainder of the house. Using plastic sheeting, construction-grade lumber, and an acrylic panel, droplet spread can be nearly eliminated, reducing the bioburden exposure of the family and thereby dramatically reducing the risk of transmission. By incorporating a sliding window, the family can still easily see and speak with the isolated health care worker and even deliver items through the sliding mechanism. By placing the isolation wall just outside of a bedroom door, an anteroom can be created. With the window closed, the health care worker can see and talk with the family from the anteroom. To pass items into the isolation room, the health care worker sprays the anteroom with disinfectant, leaves the anteroom, and closes the bedroom door. Then, the family member can slightly raise the access window, deliver food or other necessities, close the window, and perform hand hygiene. This process should dramatically reduce bioburden exposure and mitigate the risk of household spread.",

If not, a ground floor window may be used as an entry point. Then, acquire supplies as listed in the Table. 2. Carefully measure the hallway width 3\u2032-4\u2032 outside of the bedroom door. This will be the location of the isolation wall. 3. At this location, identify studs in the wall by knocking or with a stud finder. By tapping the drywall with one's hand (similar to percussing a chest wall during physical examination), a tone change marks the location of a wooden stud. If studs are found, wood screws can be used to secure the isolation wall frame. If studs cannot be located, drywall anchors may be used as an alternative. 4. Cut 2 horizontal frame supports, A, from the 2\u02ba \u00d7 4\u02ba board to the hallway width ( Figure 1 ). Measure this distance and cut accurately to ensure proper fit. (Most saws can be used to cut the lumber to length, including table saw, miter saw, hand saw, circular saw, jig saw, or coping saw.) 5. Determine the dimensions of the window based on the size of the acrylic that was acquired. Ideally, this window should occupy most of the width of the hallway (approximately 36\u02ba-40\u02ba) and be approximately 30\u02ba in height. Cut to shape, if necessary. Cutting may be avoided by purchasing an acrylic panel of an acceptable window size, adjusting the height and horizontal spacing of the vertical frames, B, as necessary. Glass is an acceptable alternative. 6. Cut 2 vertical frame supports from the 2\u02ba \u00d7 4\u02ba board, B, to a length approximately 4\u02ba less than the height of the acrylic window. 7. Cut 4 wall anchors, C, from the remaining 2\u02ba \u00d7 4\u02ba",
