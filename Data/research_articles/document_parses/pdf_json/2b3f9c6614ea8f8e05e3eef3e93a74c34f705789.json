However, a recent study (Ara\u00fajo and Naimi, n.d.) reported that the climatic conditions constrain the spread of the Sars-Cov-2. It is further reported that the cold climates are more favorable for the spread of the virus rather than arid and tropical climates. Another study (Sajadi et al., n.d.) supports this discussion stating that the virus spread becomes more and have smiliar cluster patterns in the colder regions within 30-50 o N having average temperatures between 5-11 o C associated with low absolute humidity (4-7 g/m 3 ).

This may be due to higher topographical elevation or reduced level (RL) of the respective locations and also could be due to seasonal changes in the location.
