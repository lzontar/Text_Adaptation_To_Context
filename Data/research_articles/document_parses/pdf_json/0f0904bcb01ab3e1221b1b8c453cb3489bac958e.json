On the other hand, in the immunocompetent patient who has viral pneumonia in the perioperative thoracic surgery period, the etiology is more likely to be a community-acquired or nosocomial virus. The viral agent may have been acquired and be incubating preoperatively, with the clinical manifestations of pneumonia only developing postoperatively, or the virus may be a true nosocomial infection. However, in the latter case, the specific etiologies parallel the viruses isolated in the community. 55 MacDonald et al 21 reported increased mortality in infants undergoing congenital heart surgery during RSV outbreaks in the community. Bork et al 7 reported a series of 128 infants who underwent cardiac transplantation, of whom 19 (15%) had CMV infections. Most of these children had symptoms within the first 2 to 3 months posttransplant. Fifteen patients had RSV infection, with infants younger than 6 months having a higher risk.

In the second child, while receiving ganciclovir, CMV was identified concurrently with an adenoviral infection. This child required a second lung transplantation after severe respiratory failure.

Houston reported two series of patients (n \u03ed 82 and n \u03ed 27, respectively) with laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB) as a complication of two urban measles epidemics. Their series are remarkably similar: the California series reported an incidence of 18.6 percent of LTB in their review of their patients meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for measles, and the Houston series reported an incidence of 22 percent. The respective mean ages of the children with LTB secondary to measles were 14.7 months and 12 months. The respective percentages of the children admitted to the ICU were 12 percent and 17.3 percent, and the respective percentages of the children requiring endotracheal intubation were 22 percent and 9 percent.In 1995, Abramson et al41 reported severe complications of measles in children requiring admission to an ICU in Israel. During two measles epidemics between January 1990 and May 1992, 500 cases of measles were reported in the Negev region; of these, 237 children were hospitalized. Of those hospitalized, 15 patients, aged 24 days to 6 years (24 \u03ee 14 months [mean \u03ee SD]), required admission to the PICU. All 15 had pneumonia with severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, 12 (80%) had severe hypoxemia (P a O 2 /F i O 2 ratio, 76 \u03ee 42), and 8 (53%) had severe hypercarbia (P a CO 2 68.4 \u03ee 9.8). All patients had interstitial infiltrate on chest radiograph, and 14 of the 15 children had additional areas of localized consolidation. In the 7 children with massive bilateral consolidations, a clinical syndrome consistent with ARDS developed.AdenovirusSchonland et al42 reviewed autopsy findings in 107 children who died with pneumonia in South Africa. Of these, 15 children (14%) had adenoviral infections, as diagnosed by histopathologic and ultrastructural features of the lungs. In 11 of these children (73%), the adenoviral infection followed a measles infection, the pathogenicity appearing to be increased when the adenoviral infection supervened on a damaged respiratory tract. Similar findings of association with fatal adenovirus infection have been reported by Chany et al 43 and Nahmias et al. 44 Adenovirus type 7 44-47 and type 3 48,49 have been reported frequently as etiologic agents in serious and fatal lung disease in infants and children. Singh-Naz et al 49 reported a 30 percent attack rate (types 2 and 3) in a nosocomial outbreak in a pediatric chronic care facility. Of the 10 patients with underlying bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 3 had progressive pulmonary failure and 2 children died (both type 3). Fatal adenoviral respiratory disease in neonates has been reported with type 7 14,50 and with type 21/H21 \u03e9 25. 14 Abzug and Levin 15 in a review of the literature of neonatal adenoviral infections through 1991 reported 11 of 13 patients with fatal infections, death occurring 4 to 19 days after onset of illness.
