We examined electrocardiograms (ECG) pre/post-medication initiation to evaluate QTc, HR, QRS duration, and presence of other arrhythmias. Results One hundred five patients (mean age 67 years; 44.8% F) were analyzed. The median time from the first dose of any treatment to post-medication ECG was 2 days (IQR: 1-3). QTc in men increased from baseline (440 vs 455 ms, p < 0.001), as well as in women (438 vs 463 ms, p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with QT prolongation increased significantly (14.3% vs 34.3%, p < 0.001) even when adjusted for electrolyte abnormalities. The number of patients whose QTc > 500 ms was significantly increased after treatment (16.2% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.01). Patients with either QTc > 500 ms or an increase of 60 ms had a higher frequency of death (47.6% vs. 22.6%, p = 0.02) with an odds ratio of 3.1 (95% CI: 1.1-8.7). Adjusting for race/ethnicity yielded no significant associations. Conclusions Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and/or azithromycin were associated with QTc prolongation but did not result in fatal arrhythmias.

Our data highlights the importance of standardized pre-and post-treatment ECG monitoring in COVID-19 patients.

This is supported by the high intubation rate in our cohort and may contribute to the observed mortality rate. Additionally, intubation and mortality rates likely reflect the selection of the sicker COVID-19 infected population. Despite this, treatment with hydroxychloroquine did not appear to cause harmful proarrhythmic events. Additional prospective controlled studies will be necessary to truly determine the risk-benefit ratio of such therapy.
