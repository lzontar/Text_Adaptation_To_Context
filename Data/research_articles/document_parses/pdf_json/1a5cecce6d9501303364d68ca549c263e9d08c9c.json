However, its active compounds and mechanisms of action are still unknown. Firstly, we divided QFPD into five functional units (FUs) according to the compatibility theory of traditional Chinese medicine. The corresponding common targets of the five FUs were all significantly enriched in Go Ontology (oxidoreductase activity, lipid metabolic process, homeostatic process, etc.), KEGG pathways (steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, etc.), TTD diseases (chronic inflammatory diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary Disease, etc.), miRNA (MIR183), kinase (CDK7) and TF (LXR). QFPD contained 257 specific targets in addition to HCoV, pneumonia and ACE2 co-expression proteins. Then, network topology analysis of the five components-target-pathway-disease networks yielded 67 active ingredients. In addition, ADMET estimations showed that 20 compounds passed the stringent lead-like criteria and in silico drug-likeness test with high gastrointestinal absorption and the median lethal dose (LD50 > 1600mg/kg). Moreover, 4 specific ingredients (M3, S1, X2 and O2) and 5 common ingredients (MS1, MX16, SX1, WO1 and XO1) of QFPD presented good molecular docking score for 2019-nCov structure and non-structure proteins. Finally, drug perturbation of COVID-19 network robustness showed that all five FUs may protect COVID-19 independently, and target 8 specifically expressed drug-attacked nodes which were related to the bacterial and viral responses, immune system, signaling transduction, etc. In conclusion, our new FUNP analysis showed that QFPD had a protection effect on COVID-19 by regulating a complex molecular network with safety and efficacy. Part of the mechanism was associated with the regulation of anti-viral, antiinflammatory activity and metabolic programming.

QFPD is a compound prescription in TCM including Ma Xing Shi Gan decoction (MSXG), She Gan Ma Huang decoction (SGMH), Xiao Chai Hu (XCH), and Wu Ling San (WLS), which was first discovered in the classic Treatise on Exogenous Febrile Disease (Shanghan Lun). MXSG (Herba Ephedrae, Radix Glycyrrhizae, Semen Armeniacae Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum) has been used for the treatment of the common cold, fever, and influenza virus infections via damaging the viral surface structure and inhibiting viral entry [3] . SGMH (Herba Ephedrae, Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata, Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens , Radix Asteris, Flos Farfarae, Rhizoma Belamcandae, Herba Asari) is a classical prescription for the treatment of flu-like symptoms, asthma, inflammation, tonsillitis and sore throat [4] . XCH (Radix Glycyrrhizae, Radix Bupleuri, Radix Scutellariae, Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata, Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens) possesses antiviral [5] and various anticarcinogenic properties [6] . WLS (Ramulus Cinnamomi, Rhizoma Alismatis, Polyporus Umbellatus, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, Poria), a famous Chinese prescription for nephritic syndrome, can improve kidney excretion function and inhibit inflammatory response [7] . These researches indicate that MXSG, SGMH, XCH and WLS may be functional units of formula QFPD. Previous studies have focused on the mechanism of compound prescription based on a single traditional Chinese medicine. However, it may not reflect functional compatibility mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, it is worthy of comparing the similarities and QFPD contains a total of 21 traditional Chinese medicines, and it is difficult to elucidate the complex mechanism of QFPD on COVID-19 by traditional pharmacological methods due to the multi-components and multi-targets of the formula. Network pharmacology, a new method in recent years, can integrate interactions of drugs, targets, pathways and diseases into a biological network system [8] . Therefore, more and more TCM researchers have begun to use network pharmacology to explore the material basis of TCM, and to reveal the overall comprehensive effects of multi-path, multicomponent and multi-target of TCM prescription and its treatment of diseases [9, 10] . More importantly, previous study reported that disease conditions can be more fragile than health systems against various perturbations for the un-optimized system [11] .
