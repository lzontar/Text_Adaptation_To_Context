The activation of endothelial cells leads to the expression of cell adhesion molecules, such as selectins and members of the immunoglobulin supergene family, and initiates a complex procedure called the \"adhesion cascade\" (32). Proinflammatory cytokines also induce the release of various cytokines, such as IL-8, from endothelial cells, thus promoting the expression of corresponding adhesion receptors on peripheral blood granulocytes, which initiates the transendothelial migration of cells into the inflamed tissue. lL-8 is known to be a potent neutrophil chemotactic protein (33) and has been shown to be constantly synthesized in the nasal mucosa (21) , probably by epithelial cells, in order to maintain neutrophils on the mucosal surface as an important part ol the nasal defense mechanism. In acute sinusitis, the increased synthesis of large amounts of IL-8 mav be related to the strong tissue neutro- philia seen in the mucosa.
