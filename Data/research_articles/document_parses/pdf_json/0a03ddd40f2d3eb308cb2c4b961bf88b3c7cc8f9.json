Use of videolaryngoscopy to increase the distance from the patient's airway and the chance of success during first attempt 3. Immediate inflation of the tracheal tube cuff and connection to the ventilatory circuit, thereby avoiding manual ventilation 4. Use of a HEPA filter placed on the expiratory limb of a ventilator or between the tracheal tube and a self-inflating bag ventilator 5. Intubation in a negative pressure room, or, if not available, a single room with closed doorsOf note, we did not use plexiglass \"intubation boxes\" 6 as they are difficult to transport and limit mobility during intubation without necessarily providing superior protection compared to videolaryngoscopy. 7Intubation teams: At the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis the anaesthesiology department created intubation teams that performed all intubations in the hospital. The team consisted of an attending anaesthesiologist and two residents. The most experienced provider performed the intubation and the next most experienced provider administered medications, monitored vital signs, and assisted with the intubation. The most junior member remained outside the room to provide additional supplies if needed and monitor for breaches in PPE. Prior to entering the room, we performed a huddle with the patient's medical team, nurse and respiratory therapist to review medical history, procedural steps for intubation, and contingency plans.Training providers: In addition to wide distribution of the airway management protocol through emails, fliers, and grand rounds, we created a simulation video demonstrating PPE donning and doffing and intubation sequence. We also held PPE donning and doffing training sessions in the simulation center using mock PPE for residents and faculty.From March 11 to May 4, 2020 we performed 446 intubations with a peak of 32 intubations on April 8. During the height of the crisis two intubation teams were on call at all times. The well-established airway management guidelines and COVID-19 bags allowed intubation teams to perform a rapidly escalating number of tracheal intubations efficiently and safely.",
