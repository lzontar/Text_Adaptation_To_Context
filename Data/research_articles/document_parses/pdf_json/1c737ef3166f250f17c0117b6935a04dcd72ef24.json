            "text": "In 1962, Freeman and Todd 3 reported in a retrospective study that of 357 hospitalized children with viral respiratory infections proved by positive viral isolates on cultures, 27% wheezed during the virus infection. Especially in children under age 2, wheezing occurred in infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (52%), parainfluenza (21%), and adenoviruses (13%). In a 20-month mean follow-up, 50% of the children who wheezed with the viral infection, especially those with parainfluenza, subsequently developed asthma or other allergies, whereas this occurred in only 17% of the children who did not wheeze with the virus infection. Boesen 4 observed that, when asthmatic bronchitis occurred under age 1, later allergy occurred only rarely, whereas if it occurred between ages 1 and 3 or over 3 years, later asthma occurred in 25% and 50%, respectively. These studies suggested that early virus-induced asthmatic bronchitis was associated with later development of asthma and other allergies. Three reports in the late 1950s associated outbreaks of Asian infuenza in camps with epidemics of wheezing or asthma, s- 7 Berkovich et al. 9 prospectively investigated 32 chronically hospitalized children under 5 years of age with bacterial and viral cultures and serologic studies at the onset of each of 102 acute respiratory illnesses, which averaged 3.2 infections per child. In the 2 years, 42% of acute wheezing attacks were associated with proved viral infections. At times when particular respiratory viruses were prevalent, the proportion of wheezing attacks due to infection was much higher, e.g., 85% during one winter with RSV, parainfluenza, and coronaviruses. RSV was most common in 25 of 32 (78%) children; 24 cases were associated with wheezing, 13 with lung infiltrates or atelectasis, and 17 required bronchodilators. Parainfluenza type 2 and types 3 and 1 were second, with wheezing in 12 of 32 children. In 10 children with only coronavirus OC 38-43, all had symptoms, 7 with wheezing and 3 with pneumonia. Wheezing occurred in 4 of 13 adenovirus infections. In these young children, no wheezing occurred with 11 influenza A2 (Hong Kong) infections in contrast to other studies on older children and adults. Furthermore, there was no correlation of wheezing illness with infections with common gram-positive or -negative bacterial pathogens. They concluded that 42% (58/139) of episodes of wheezing in young children were associated with identifiable virus infections, predominantly RSV, parainfluenza type 2, and coronaviruses.",

First, 1\u00b0 in a group of 16 school-age (3--11 years of age), nonallergic, \"intrinsic\" asthmatic children, two-thirds (42/61) of asthma attacks were coincident with severe respiratory infections (SRIs). Asthma occurred in 38 of 49 SRIs and mild respiratory infections in only 4 of 22. Rhinovirus infections predominated in which 15 of 26 (58%) produced both asthma and severe infection (fever and two other signs or symptoms, e.g., rhinorrhea and cough). Influenza A2 (Hong Kong) in six children caused asthma and SRI, although in three cases other infectious agents were present. However, wheezing was present in all patients with influenza A2HK infection. In this age group, no other viruses or bacteria precipitated asthma attacks (except one with Haemophilus influenza). The virus spectrum associated with asthma attacks in these school-age nonatopic children differed from that found by McIntosh et al. 9 in preschool atopic children. McIntosh et al. 9 found parainfluenza 2 but no influenza A2HK associated with asthma attacks, whereas Minor et al.l\u00b0 found the exact converse. The latter suggested that the severe infections caused the respiratory irritation required to exacerbate asthma.",

            "text": "Overall, the total respiratory infection (viral and bacterial) incidence in both groups was not statistically different; asthmatics had a lower incidence of bacterial infections than their siblings. Concurrent respiratory infections occurred in 24 instances in asthmatics and their siblings in whom the average duration of infection was 6.1 and 4.4 days, respectively. Although illnesses lasted longer in asthmatics, this difference was not significant (p > 0.05). Minor et al. n suggested that the difference in infection rate in asthmatics was due to their necessarily increased indoor life in a cold climate, resulting in longer exposures to respiratory viruses shed by other family members. This increased exposure was especially to rhinoviruses, which are likely to precipitate asthma attacks. Not mentioned was the possibility that the slow resolution of mucus plugging of the small airways after an asthmatic attack might leave the asthmatic more vulnerable to a fresh infection. Minor et al. n concluded that exposure of asthmatic children to individuals with respiratory infections should be minimized. In a subsequent study by the Wisconsin group, Minor et alY confirmed that both rhinoviruses and influenza A virus infections were asthmagenic. Forty-one children, aged 3-17 years, and 8 adults, aged 22-60 years, with four or more infection-induced asthmatic attacks per year were cultured during infections. Asthma occurred in 55% (71/128) of symptomatic respiratory infections; the pathogen was identified in 42 of 128 infections, 19 of which were associated with wheezing. Seven of 15 symptomatic rhinovirus infections were linked with asthma, as were 4 of 5 influenza A and 2 of 3 RSV infections. Rhinoviruses of 14 different serologic types were associated with wheezing. Although type-specific rhinovirus immunity appears to be longlasting, the 89 known rhinovirus types provide a sufficient variety of exposure for successive wheezing attacks in asthmatics. Certain rhinovirus types may be more asthmagenic, such as type 49 in 1972, which was associated with asthma in 5 of 6 infected individuals. Although virus identification in older children and adult asthmatics was more difficult, viruses appeared to precipitate wheezing in a wide age spectrum of asthmatics.",

In preschool children, RSV and parainfluenza are predominant in this role, whereas in older children and adults, rhinovirus and influenza A are predominant. Occasionally, other viruses such as corona-and adenoviruses may be involved. Bacterial infections generally do not provoke wheezing, although in some asthmatics they may accompany virus infections and possibly play an as yet unexplored adjunctive role. Therefore, prophylaxis of asthma attacks involves prevention of contact between the asthmatic patient and individuals with respiratory infections.",

That asthma runs in families was known in ancient days.l A simple Mendelian dominant inheritance pattern was proposed by Cooke and VanderVeer,13 who observed that if both parents were allergic, 75% of their children developed allergy, most often in their preschool years; however, if only one parent was allergic, only 50% of their children developed allergy. Today, we know that the genetics of atopy is polygenic.14-16 The total serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E level is concordant in monozygotic twins and usually discordant in dizygotic twins.14 Total serum IgE is controlled by a gene not on chromosome no. 6.",

            "text": "Immune response (Ir) and immune suppressor (Is) genes of the histocompatibility loci (HLA) on human chromosome no. 6 appear to control responsiveness to certain allergens. Levine et al.15 described a hayfever haplotype in seven families allergic to ragweed. One haplotype occurred in all ragweedsensitive family members, but not all members with that haplotype were allergic. However, no member of the family who was allergic to ragweed failed to have that haplotype. In different families different haplotypes were associated with ragweed allergy. Friedhoff et al. 16 found certain positive correlations (Ir genes) of HLA type and IgE antibodies to particular pollen fractions (ragweed Ra5 with HLA-Dw2, B7; Ra3 with HLA-A2, A28) and a negative correlation (Is genes) of HLA type with other pollen allergens (Ra3 with HLA-A3, All). In a study by Hozouri et al., 17 monozygotic twins generally had a high concordance rate for the presence or absence of positive skin tests and a radioallergosorbent (RAST) test. This was true of monozygotic twins raised in different as well as in similar environments; this reinforces a genetic basis for atopy. Human Ir and Is genes have been associated with a response or a lack of response to certain virus infections; e.g., HLA-Dw2 individuals are poor T-cell responders to measles virus, which suggests an Is gene that may cause susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.18 Dutch army recruits with HLA-C3 failed to develop lymphoproliferation with vaccinia after primary vaccination, suggesting Is genes or the lack of a target cell receptor for the vaccinia virus.19 It is conceivable that certain viruses stimulate HLA-associated Ir or Is genes for certain allergens, thereby initiating the allergic sensitization process in genetically susceptible individuals. Viral respiratory infections in children from allergic families appear to be associated temporally with the onset of allergy in our studies. 2\u00b0' 21 In families with two allergic parents, 24 infants were followed at 3-month intervals for symptoms or signs of allergy involving skin, nose, ears, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, and also by in vitro immunologic tests for allergy. This test panel consisted of radioimmunoassay for total serum IgE (PRIST) and specific IgE antibodies to a panel of six common allergens in children by a RAST test, leukocyte histamine release, and lymphoproliferation with the same allergens (crude house dust, Dermatophagoidesfarinae mite, cat pelt, dog dander, ryegrass pollen, cow's milk, and soybean extracts). When it became evident that virus infections might be associated with allergic sensitization, serial serum samples were tested for virus antibodies by complement fixation tests performed by the State of California Virus Diagnostic Laboratory, Berkeley, California. The respiratory virus antibody panel consisted of influenza A, parainfluenzae 1-3, RSV, cytomegalic inclusion virus (CMV), adenovirus, and My. pneumoniae.",

Measles infections have long been known aa to induce a state of cellular immune anergy; e.g., patients with positive skin reactions to tuberculin may temporarily lose this response during clinical measles, and this anergic state may last for weeks. Tuberculin-induced lymphoblastogenesis in such patients is impaired, although the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) response appears normal. An \"allergic breakthrough\" mechanism has been proposed by Katz 3\u00b0 in which the IgE antibody system is a powerful initiator of inflammation normally controlled by IgE suppressor T cells, the \"normal damping mechanism.\" He suggests that various stimuli or events depress the suppressor T cells, thus abrogating the damping mechanism. This permits escape of IgE helper ceils to stimulate IgE B cells to make IgE antibodies. Levine and Vaz 31 showed that certain mouse strains with similar H-2 histocompatibility antigen were either \"responders\" or \"nonresponders\" for IgE production when stimulated with small microgram amounts of certain antigens in alum. Poor or nonresponders were C57B1/6 and SJL/J strains, suggesting a genetic deficiency in Ir genes. However, Chiorazzi eta] . 32 demonstrated that pretreatment of SJL/ J mice with low-dose irradiation (150 rads), with antilymphocyte serum, or with cyclophosphamide 7-10 days before low-dose antigen (10 p,g DNP Ascaris in alum) immunization caused a brisk rise in IgE antibodies in this nonresponder strain. They showed by passive cell transfer experiments that suppressor T cells, which were especially sensitive to these treatments, were depleted in the mice. Then the IgE antibody response could be abrogated by transfusion of spleen cells from normal SJL/J mice by restoring suppressor T cells. More recently, Katz 33 has demonstrated soluble factors in supernatants from suppressor and helper T cells, termed suppressor (SFA) and enhancer (EFA) factors of allergy, respectively.",

The virus spreads from the initial infection site with progressive involvement of adjacent areas of the respiratory epithelium. The removal of this protective barrier exposes the basal cell layer to direct, facile penetration by allergens to the subepithelial mast cells. The irritant receptors are directly exposed or even sloughed, leaving exposed nerves that can also fire to cause bronchospasm with minimal stimulation.",

This increased bronchoconstricfive responsiveness in subjects with colds returned to normal over a 7-week period. A similar result occurred with a cough response to inhaled citric acid in subjects with colds. 3s Both responses to inhaled histamine and citric acid in these subjects could be prevented or reversed with inhaled isoproterenol or atropine. These observations were confirmed by Laitinen et ald 6 who measured baseline airway responsiveness to histamine inhalation in 12 normal subjects and then administered double-blind intranasally to half the group either live attenuated influenza A and B viruses or a placebo. Four of six virus-infected subjects had 70% increases in airway resistance on day 2 after histamine inhalation challenge, less of an increase on day 4, and none by day 9. This effect of virus infection was reversed or prevented by isoproterenol or atropine aerosols. These studies suggest an increased responsiveness of \"irritant cholinergic receptors\" to inhaled irritants during respiratory virus infections.",

Seven days after the infection, the placebo group had further decreases in density dependence, whereas the amantadine-treated group had significant increases, which suggested accelerated improvement of peripheral airway dysfunction in the arnantadine group. After inhalation of carbachol aerosol, 25 subjects in both groups had prolonged increases in total respiratory resistance that diminished over a 7-week period. Little et alY suggested that a nonpneumonitic influenza infection had an inflammatory response mostly in the peripheral airways, with transient bronchial hyperreactivity. Amantadine arrested epithelial proliferation of virus associated with inflammation of the peripheral airways, but the virus had already initially damaged airway epithelium, causing bronchial hyperirritability that was not ameliorated by amantadine therapy. Little et al. 37 concluded that bronchial hyperreactivity was common and prolonged during the course of nonpneumonitic influenza infections in normal individuals.",

Tracheal and bronchial strips from ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs that had been infected 4 days before with parainfluenza 3 and noninfected controls were challenged in vitro with ovalbumin in the presence or absence of sulfonterol. ~-Adrenergic agonists inhibit both antigen-induced tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle contraction and release of histamine and SRS-A from minced lung (mast cells). Sulfonterol, the partial ~ agonist, appears to stimulate only the ~-adrenergic receptors on smooth musde that inhibit its contraction and has no effect on mast cell receptors that inhibit histamine release. Isoproterenol stimulates ~ receptors in both tissues. Parainfluenza 3 infection blocked only the sulfonterol stimulation of smooth muscle f~ receptors, leading to increased smooth muscle contraction, but did not block ~ receptors on mast cells and thus did not affect histamine and SRS-A release. Furthermore, increasing sulfonterol concentration overcame the virus-blocking action that suggested a competition between parainfluenza 3 virus and sulfonterol for ~-adrenergic receptors. These experiments suggest that certain viruses may have an affinity only for certain autonomic receptors that alters physiologic end-organ responsiveness to various stimuli.",

            "text": "A third postulated effect of viruses in allergy and/or asthma is on the effector target cells---basophils and mast cells. Ida et al. 49 demonstrated that herpesvirus (HSV-1), influenza A virus, and adeno-1 viruses, whether live or killed, markedly enhanced in vitro histamine release from leukocytes (basophils) of ragweed atopic patients with ragweed antigen E or anti-IgE serum. Interferon appeared to be the soluble factor in these experiments that caused this enhancement. Interferon inducers, poly I-C, and both purified human fibroblast and leukocyte interferons (IFN~ and IFN~) all caused enhanced histamine release. Although the mechanism is unknown, virus infections that induce interferon may markedly enhance specific IgE-mediated atopic reactions. Finally, specific IgE antibodies to viruses have been implicated in classic allergic reactions to such viruses. IgE antibodies to RSV were bound to RSVinfected epithelial cells in nasopharyngeal secretions of children with RSV infections; they were especially persistent in children with wheezing, s\u00b0 Subsequently, Welliver et al.51 tested 79 children under I year of age with proved RSV infection for IgE antibodies to RSV and for histamine content of nasopharyngeal secretions. IgE antibodies to RSV in secretions rose significantly 14 days beyond the onset of illness, with mean titers of 20 during the first 2 weeks, to 58 by 2 months, and 90 by 3 months. More striking, however, were the differences in IgE antibodies to RSV when the children were divided into wheezing and nonwheezing groups. In both acute and convalescent stages of RSV infection the wheezing infants had significantly higher IgE anti-RSV antibody titers (p < 0.05) than did nonwheezing infants. The histamine content of nasopharyngeal secretions was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in wheezing compared to nonwheezing children. There was a highly significant correlation (r = -0.92, p < 0.001) between the peak of IgE anti-RSV antibody and the severity of illness, as determined by the degree of hypoxia. These studies suggest a possible IgE-mediated allergic response with histamine release to the RSV antigen, resulting in wheezing in children with this virus infection.",

On the other hand, in both CMV and EBV infectious mononucleosis, Bahna et al. 28 found an acute two-to six-fold rise in total [gE and its prolonged suppression during convalescence. Similarly, in nonallergic Army recruits, Perelmutter et al. 29 found elevated IgE in several acute respiratory virus infections and postinfection suppression for several months. Therefore, many virus infections have important effects on the regulatory mechanisms of a variety of immune responses some effects are augmented and others are depressed, depending upon the stage of the virus infection and the immune system being observed.",
