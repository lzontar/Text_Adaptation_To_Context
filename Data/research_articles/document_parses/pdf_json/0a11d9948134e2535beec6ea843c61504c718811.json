From an early stage, it was clear to me that there was potential for me to be exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The infection prevention policy at my institution at the time, which was aligned with national guidelines [4] , permitted the use of respirator (i.e. filtering face piece 3 ) masks only when managing a patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. That said, when managing all other patients, including those awaiting swab results, surgical facemasks were to be used. Both national and local policies have since changed to incorporate wider use of respirator masks, possibly indicating that surgical facemasks were not providing adequate protection in the context of a high population prevalence of COVID-19 [5] . Nevertheless, as a fit 26-year-old with no significant comorbidities, I was sure that if I was infected, the consequences were unlikely to be severe. Unfortunately, this was not to be the case.",

I adopted a prone position, however, the deterioration was not arrested, and even with an F I O 2 of 0.60 I was hypoxic and tachypnoeic. A review by a critical care consultant recommended transfer to the critical care unit for tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. It had never previously occurred to me that I might deteriorate to this state; hence this news On the positive side, my experiences as a doctor resulted in total trust in the medical teams caring for me. Their communication was exceptional and incorporated varying styles which were appropriate to my clinical condition. The admitting medical teams discussed my case in lay terms, whereas the critical care team and the medical team that cared for me following critical care provided much more detail. The critical care team used clinical terminology when updating me, and knowing the results of blood tests, blood gas analyses and chest radiographs made me feel involved in my own care. Further, this sense of familiarity helped ease my anxiety during an otherwise alien experience. One aspect that I would have found useful was a rough prediction of clinical trajectory over the next 24 h. The course of COVID-19 is challenging to predict [8] , and clinicians were understandably reticent to offer this in view of the variability of outcomes. Having said that, I would not have held an inaccurate prediction against the clinician who made it. Having even a rough estimate of my clinical trajectory may have provided a sense of control that I was profoundly lacking.",

During my last shift before falling ill, I was involved in the case of a male patient, even younger than me, who tragically died due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinicians at my stage often think in anecdotes and our memories hold onto extreme scenarios. Therefore, this young man's case dominated my overall experience, which may otherwise have been more balanced. Additionally, I was aware that the need for tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation had implications about the severity of my illness, and I was familiar with many of the complications of tracheal intubation. When utilised rationally, this knowledge is an asset. In my case, I found that this knowledge only exacerbated my fears.",

I am usually healthy and active, and I enjoyed unrestricted freedom and independence. As a patient on the critical care unit, I found that I was dependent on healthcare staff for basic tasks, including repositioning myself, reaching for a drink and personal hygiene. Interestingly, during the days immediately following tracheal extubation, I possessed little motivation to attempt these tasks and felt that I was becoming apathetic towards my own functionality. During this short period, I felt my recovery was static; a viewpoint that was perhaps distorted due to frustration derived from a desperation to recover quickly.",

The speech and language therapists had a similar positive effect and despite my apathy, they encouraged me to eat and drink safely. It is notable that only 3 days after the initial involvement of therapy staff, I was discharged, 4 days earlier than predicted.

            "text": "provoked anxiety. The brief telephone conversation with my family, including a forced positive message, was my last clear memory before tracheal intubation. I remained on the ventilator, oblivious to events for 6 days (Figure 1). My recollections of tracheal extubation are unclear, and my initial memory was of the tracheal tube being pulled out aggressively followed by a lot of shouting. The critical care team reassured me that my recollections did not represent actual events. I spent two further days on the critical care unit while receiving physiotherapy, monitoring and oxygen via a facemask, before stepping down to a medical ward. I remained on the general ward for 2 days with care provided by the medical team, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and the critical care outreach team. The urinary catheter and nasogastric tube were removed on the first day. I commenced a soft diet and my mobility reached a stage where I could walk unaided. Once my peripheral oxygen saturations were > 92% on air and my clinical condition stable, I was discharged home.At present, my strength and mobility is improving. My breathing has normalised, however, my voice is quiet and hoarse. I have been advised that 6-8 weeks of rehabilitation post-discharge is required before my re-transition from patient to carer.DiscussionDespite this being an ephemeral experience compared with most critically unwell patients with COVID-19, the role reversal of going from clinician to patient provided me with a different perspective on clinical care. My reflections focus mainly on the psychological aspects of my experience. I nevertheless acknowledge that my memory of some aspects is hazy and my reflections may be imprecise.One major issue was a real and a perceived lack of control, which I found difficult to process. Even though I am at the start of my medical career, I am accustomed to an element of influence in patient management based on relevant information. Further, in this situation I found it very challenging to process what information I did possess, perhaps due to fatigue or hypoxia. In addition, when caring for patients, I am able to plot their progress and anticipate their clinical improvement or deterioration.This was not something I could glean as a patient; this led to uncertainty in my own mind and potentiated fears that I already possessed regarding my clinical condition.",
