Sixty-eight patients with inflammatory CNS diseases and 30 healthy volunteers were included in this prospective observational cohort study. The observational period was between January 2005 and May 2009. The CO 2 R was measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound using the breath-holding method. We compared patients with normal CO 2 R (breath-holding index [BHI m ]\u22651.18=BHI N group) with patients who showed impaired CO 2 R (BHI m <1.18=BHI R group). We also analyzed the association of impaired CO 2 R with the etiology, severity, and outcome of disease. When compared to the BHI N group, the patients from the BHI R group were older, had a heavier consciousness disturbance, experienced more frequent respiratory failure, and, subsequently, had worse outcomes. There were no fatalities among the 28 patients in the BHI N group. The comparison of subjects with bacterial and non-bacterial meningitis revealed no significant differences. The unfavorable outcome of disease (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score 1-3) was significantly more common in subjects with impaired CO 2 R (62.5% vs. 10.7%). Logistic regression analysis was performed in order to establish the prognostic value of BHI m . The outcome variable was unfavorable outcome (GOS 1-3), while the independent variables were age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and BHI m . The age and BHI m showed the strongest influence on disease outcome. A decrease of BHI m for each 0.1 unit increased the risk of unfavorable outcome by 17%.
