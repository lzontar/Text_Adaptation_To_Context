Lazio's regional health system has provided 2000 ordinary hospital beds and 450 intensive care unit beds for the management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This system follows the hub and spokes model, with nine coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospital hubs [1] . Similar to the procedures implemented by the Lombardy Section of the Italian Society of Nephrology [2] , Lazio's regional dialysis centres expressed a need for 'shared protocols' in order to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patient population. Therefore, a regional technical commission for healthcare, together with representatives of the Regional Nephrology and Dialysis Commission, implemented and published in the official bulletin of the Lazio region a protocol entitled 'COVID-19 emergency: route for taking care of patients with chronic kidney disease'. The protocol, which is described below, has been shared by all dialysis centres and by patient associations.",

In this area, patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and kidney graft recipients, with suspected/confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should be isolated before a final medical decision is made based on clinical, laboratory and diagnostic results. This area should include a dedicated dialysis room to treat ESRD patients with suspected/confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A nephrologist should ask about possible symptoms since last dialysis, including fever, cough, dizziness and dyspnoea, and fill out an anamnestic form for the detection of suspected cases. Patients completing screening as 'negative' may travel to the centre for their usual dialysis treatment. Body temperature should be measured at the entrance of the dialysis facility. In case of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients must be sent to the emergency department where they will follow the hospital's procedure for suspected COVID-19 cases. Patients should undergo a nasopharyngeal swab test, chest X-ray or computed tomography (if indicated), and monitoring of temperature and oxygen saturation. While waiting for the results of the swab, if a dialysis session cannot be delayed, the patient should be treated as positive in a dedicated room within the 'COVID-19 zone'; if the dialysis session can be postponed the patient should wait in the 'COVID-19 zone' until the diagnostic results are available. If the outcome of a swab or blood sample is negative, the patient may return to the haemodialysis ward for treatment. In case of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the patient should be transferred to a hospital within the COVID-19 network. If the dialysis session cannot be delayed after the transfer, it should be performed in the dedicated dialysis room in the 'COVID-19 zone'.",
