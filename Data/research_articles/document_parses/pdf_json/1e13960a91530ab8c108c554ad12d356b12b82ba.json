            "text": "Neurotropism is a well-known feature of beta-coronaviruses, of which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1), is one, with effects on the brain stem, and in particular, the cardiorespiratory center thought to result in breathing dysfunction (2) . The Italian experience has displayed the presence of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 positive patients (3) . The Chinese study from Wuhan published in JAMA Neurology reported neurological manifestations in a significant proportion (36.4%) of patients with COVID-19 (4) . Recent findings surrounding anosmia as an early symptom of COVID- 19 have invoked further interest in this hypothesis (5) . The role of the central component in hyposmia could also be suspected. Those presenting with symptoms of skeletal muscle damage are at higher risk of liver and kidney damage. It is evident that the virus is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is postulated to occur post-infection due to interactions with the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present at various sites within the cerebral circulation (6) . Another case report on a female airline worker with COVID-19 positive status developing acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy (7), a condition that is typically seen following cytokine storm in influenza, suggests possible BBB compromise. Independent of possible neurotropism, COVID-19 infection is associated with coagulopathy (elevated D-dimer and severe platelet reduction) and may disrupt blood pressure regulation through interaction with the ACE2 receptor. COVID-19 could possibly contribute to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke aside from neurotropism (8) . Taken together these anecdotal reports suggest a possible neuroinvasive potential of the virus.",

They agree with the model proposed by Khosravani et al. (10) with regards to presuming COVID positive status unless proven otherwise. Notably, these guidelines concur with the \"Consensus Statement from Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology & Critical Care\" about \"Anesthetic Management of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke During COVID-19 Pandemic (9), \" in that general anesthesia should be used if there are concerns surrounding the need for mid-procedural conversion and intubation which could be very detrimental and could expose the whole team, a scenario that should be avoided at all cost.

We expect that there is a significant amount of variability based on institution and country with respect to COVID-19 testing. For example, the earliest possible result time for COVID testing at one of our hospitals is 7 h but the serology test that would take minutes to give a result was just Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and hopefully will be introduced soon but until this is available widely it will be practically difficult to rule out COVID-19 during code stroke (at least at many hospitals in the US and elsewhere), and as such, we propose that all patients undergoing code stroke be presumed COVID-19 positive. This is concurrent with the American Heart Association (AHA) emergency guidelines for stroke centers in the context of COVID-19 (14) . All COVID-19 positive patients should be triaged into COVID-19 neuro or COVID-19 non-neuro wards depending upon the presence of neurological symptoms (6) .

In light of these anecdotal findings, it is relevant that guidelines pertaining to seizure management in COVID-19 cases are not available, to the best of our knowledge. With regards to chronic epilepsy patients, longer-term medicine prescription, use of telemedicine, and optimal seizure management plans have been recommended (23) .

Indeed it is also overlooked that the scarcity of resources can impact the management of patients and potentially result in some patient who may have ordinarily fared better having worse outcomes, another key factor in terms of mental health issues and also indeed the morale of healthcare workers, which can have longer terms impacts in terms of the efficiency and drive of health systems (26) . Considering public health ethics, and more specifically the concept of utilitarianism which forms a key part of this, the need to protect our frontline healthcare workers and support their health becomes evident. Utilitarianism refers to judging actions based on how much good they will do for the greatest number of people -thereby forming the backbone of ethics and health policy debate underpinning the crisis (27) . Protecting our healthcare workers gives the most benefit. This can, therefore, involve protecting them from contracting the infection, which could then be spread to their families, other patients, and resultantly the community, as well as focusing on their psychological health so they are able to discharge their duties efficiently and effectively.

In this article, we have identified and proposed various considerations that may minimize the risk to health systems, healthcare workers, and the patients. The differential diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV2) infection should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms during the COVID-19 period (4). This is important to avoid missed or delayed diagnosis and prevent viral transmission. All patients amidst this pandemic should be screened for COVID-19 and telemedicine could be used to triage these patients and possibly deliver intravenous thrombolysis. For those who may be candidates for endovascular thrombectomy, extra precautions need to be taken to minimize procedural risks associated with the aerosol transmission of the COVID-19 virus and possible exposure to the healthcare staff. An example of reperfusion therapy work-up with PPEs in a COVID-19 stroke patient is illustrated in Figure 2 . Public health campaigns to educate and increase awareness of the community about the need to seek urgent medical attention should acute neurological symptoms occur. Special considerations also apply for patients with traumatic brain injury and those requiring urgent aneurysm surgery or carotid endarterectomy. We are alarmed at the rising deaths of healthcare workers who are waging a war against the COVID-19 without the provision of adequate PPE to defend themselves. The cost of adopting the proposed protocol and its impact on the quality of care merits further study. The current consortium is expeditiously working toward rapid adoption of the proposed protocol. Further study on the impact and cost these measures may have on the quality of care and its results are envisaged. However, given the nature of the pandemic and emerging situation, the safety of healthcare workers' is paramount and thus justifies the heightened safety measures suggested in our protocol with an anticipation that this would hopefully limit the exposure. Minimizing the harm to healthcare workers should be a priority as potential exposure can not only compromise the health systems, expose other workers, and patients to COVID-19; but will also have a negative impact on the morale of professional colleagues.",

A patient in the age-group of 65-75 years, with a history of atrial fibrillation and on anticoagulation, presented to an outside facility with difficulty breathing (dyspnea), high temperature and severe cough. COVID-19 work-up was followed and the patient tested positive for COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral infiltrates (A). The patient was intubated and sedated a day later. On Day 3, the nurse noticed that she was not moving the left side to painful stimuli; given the time of onset could not be determined (unknown), intravenous thrombolysis was not given. Baseline non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head was normal; the patient was transferred to the comprehensive stroke center. CT angiography (CTA) showed the right M1 and A2 occlusions. Pre-intervention digital subtraction angiography (DSA) confirmed occlusion in the right M1 and A2 arteries (B). Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was performed successfully with complete angiographic reperfusion (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score of 3). The patient was still intubated by the time the manuscript was written.(C) Post-intervention DSA imaging demonstrated good reperfusion outcome (TICI3). A clinician with 3M TM Versaflo TM TR-600 Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPr) -personal protective equipment (PPE) for protection against the air-borne virus is shown (D). The interventional neuroradiology (INR) team doing the EVT procedure while wearing their full PPEs (sterile gown, gloves and PAPr) is shown (E). Post-procedure, all INR suite equipment including anesthesia machines and pyxis are secured using surgical drapes and equipment covers (F).
