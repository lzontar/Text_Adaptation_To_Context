Because the first affected regions (especially Lombardia) were characterized by a very high population density, the virus dramatically spread throughout Northern Italy in a few weeks. As a consequence, all cancer therapy flows were altered: surgery, systemic therapies, and radiation therapy. The radiation therapy centers located in the hospitals that were the first to face the emergency gained rapid field experience and started monitoring the situation and collecting data. This report presents a few practical suggestions from the first 2 weeks of collective work under emergency conditions and is the result of a joint effort to ensure continuity of therapies while protecting patients, health professionals, and the general population. The indications were integrated with the WHO recommendations and with the local health authorities' guidelines. The primary aim was to share information and provide guidance to radiation therapy departments worldwide. The report is mainly focused on how to deal with symptomatic, suspect, or confirmed COVID-19 patients undergoing radiation therapy. We identified five key priorities, here described, together with a brief analysis of the problems and the possible solutions.",
