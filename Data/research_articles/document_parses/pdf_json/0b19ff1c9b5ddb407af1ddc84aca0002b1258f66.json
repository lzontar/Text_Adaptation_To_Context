In this review, we comprehensively investigate the various aspects of cancer care during the pandemic, taking advantage of data generated in Asia and Europe at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic spread. Cancer wards have been subjected to several modifications to protect patients and healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infection, while attempting to maintain cancer diagnosis, therapy, and research. In this setting, the management of COVID-19 infected patients with cancer is particularly challenging. We also discuss the direct and potential remote impacts of the global pandemic on the mortality of patients with cancer. As such, the indirect impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the potential consequences in terms of cancer mortality are discussed. As the infection is spreading worldwide, we are obtaining more knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic consequences that are currently impacting and may continue to further challenge cancer care in several countries.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 crisis started in China in December 2019 with a cluster of pneumonia cases from an unknown pathogen identified first in Wuhan [9] . There are no specific clinical features that can yet reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other viral respiratory infections. Thus far, there is no specific symptom of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer. The most prevalent clinical signs of infection [9] are fever (99%), fatigue (70%), dry cough (59%), anorexia (40%), myalgias (35%), dyspnea (31%), and sputum production (27%), with anosmia and ageusia also being reported in many patients [10] . Laboratory features are leukopenia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and ferritin, elevated d-dimer, elevated creatine phosphokinase, and elevated creatinine levels [5, 7] . Consistent with viral pneumonia, chest CT scan in patients with COVID-19 most commonly demonstrates bilateral ground-glass opacifications preferentially distributed in the periphery of lower lobes [11] . Importantly, those signs are also routinely reported in patients with cancer due to the cancer, cancer therapy, or common cancer infections, generating some confusion in ascertaining the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer. However, particular attention is given to the occurrence of any of those signs during the period of the pandemic to minimize the risk of underdiagnosing COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer during the entire duration of the outbreak. This is particularly important (but not restricted to) in patients with lung cancer, who also frequently present with tobacco exposure and chronic underlying pulmonary disorders that are additional factors of vulnerability. From Chinese data, patients who underwent both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and chest CT scan for evaluation of COVID-19, a \"positive\" chest CT for COVID-19 (as determined by a consensus of two radiologists) had a sensitivity of 97%, using the PCR tests as a reference; however, specificity was only 25%. In cases where there is suspicion of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer, PCR testing and chest CT scan evaluation are highly recommended to consolidate the diagnosis [12] .",

            "text": "Particular attention was immediately given to patients with cancer in the Chinese nationwide cohort, recognizing that patients with cancer, representing about 1% of the COVID-19-infected population, were particularly vulnerable, with a case fatality rate of 5.6% compared to 2.3% in the general population. More recently, the retrospective experience from Wuhan hospitals identified a total of 28 PCR-confirmed patients with cancer who were admitted for in-patient care [13] . The population of patients with cancer comprised 60.7% males with a medium age of 65 years, with lung cancer being the most frequent tumor type (25%). Anticancer therapies provided within 14 days prior to admission were chemotherapy (10.7%), targeted therapy (7.1%), radiotherapy (3.6%), and immunotherapy (3.6%). Patients with cancer in this cohort also have concomitant morbidities associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 morbidity such as diabetes (14.3%), chronic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (14.3%), chronic liver diseases (7.1%), and pulmonary diseases (3.6%). Contamination of patients with cancer was suspected to have occurred during hospitalization in 28.6% of patients. COVID-19-related symptoms were similar in patients with cancer to those reported in the overall population, including ground-glass opacity on CT scan. Oxygen therapy was required in 78.6% of this cancer population and 7.1% of patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Patients with lung cancer and worse baseline lung function or endurance were more likely to develop severe hypoxia. Severe events occurred more frequently in stage 4 patients (70%) compared to other stages (44.4%) and in patients exposed to anticancer therapies within 14 days prior to COVID-19 infection (83%). Severe secondary complications occurring during COVID-19 infections were acute respiratory distress syndrome (28.6%), septic shock (3.6%), myocardial infarction (3.6%), and pulmonary embolism (7.1%). Importantly, deaths occurred in eight (28.6%) patients, with a median time from admission to death of 16 days. Although statistical analyses remain limited by the number of patients, multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional analysis adjusted by age and gender showed that antitumor treatment and patchy consolidation on CT scan at admission were associated with a higher risk of severe events. Although retrospective and based on a relatively small number of patients, Chinese data are important in starting to set out appropriate measures for prevention of COVID-19 infection during hospitalization (substantial cause of contamination) and the treatment of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer. However, it seems difficult to draw definitive conclusions related to data generated from the Chinese nationwide cohort where the majority of patients identified with COVID-19 infection were survivors who had no prior cancer therapy within a month prior to COVID-19 infection. Multivariate assessment of the impact of cancer staging and cancer-associated co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases were not found to be significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection but may have been underestimated because of the limited number of patients. Moreover, the cohort is restricted to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, which considering the false-negative rate of this testing may underestimate the overall COVID-19 diagnosis in patients with cancer, such as when patients are only diagnosed as being COVID-positive based on specific CT-scan images. Finally, this report appears to be restricted to the worst cases, requiring in-hospital admission, and providing no evidence of COVID-19 incidence, morbidity, and mortality in patients with cancer who had recommendations to stay at home and were not referred to a hospital. Nevertheless, this publication highlights the specific vulnerability of patients with cancer to COVID-19 infection and identifies recent prior therapy and patchy consolidation on CT scan at admission as major factors predicting the severity of infection.",

            "text": "Protecting both patients and caregivers in cancer wards is a high priority, needing to be reinforced by all possible means, and is essential for the continuity of cancer care [14] . Most hospitals are avoiding moving patients into the hospital when it is not strictly necessary, developing teleconsultations and shortening stays in outpatient clinics [15] . Several recommendations have been provided to prevent droplet and hand contamination, requiring patients and healthcare professionals to wear protective masks, use hydroalcoholic solutions, and/or wash hands before and after patient-to-professional contacts, reinforce disinfection of surfaces, avoid waiting rooms, and maintain at least a 1-m distance when circulating in the oncology ward [16] . Avoiding mixing COVID-19-positive or -suspected patients with COVID-19-free patients has become a mandatory requirement in oncology and hematology to keep oncology wards COVID-19 free [17] . Conversely, patients suspected of or confirmed as having COVID infection must be hospitalized in specifically separated COVID-19 units. This has encouraged cancer and hematology departments to consider systematically testing patients with a new cancer diagnosis or in need of cancer treatment for COVID-19 contamination, even in asymptomatic patients [18] . This is particularly applicable for patients with acute leukemia, aggressive lymphoma, or myelodysplasia, where the clinical presentation and/ or treatment with high-dose therapy with or without stem cell transplantation is associated with neutropenia, leading to an increased risk of febrile complications, due in most cases to bacterial or fungal infections. In this context, viral infection may be complicated with more frequent bacterial and fungal co-infections, with an increased likelihood of fatal outcome. Furthermore, surgery may be considered as an additional risk factor, especially in patients with comorbidities requiring post-surgery intensive care resuscitation and long-term hospitalization. In many cases such as with breast cancer, the delays have been associated with higher breast cancer-specific mortality. As a result, tumor resection for early operable stages is recommended, but whenever possible diagnostic or staging surgery should be replaced by radiologic diagnostics. Adapting surgical techniques to reduce the risks of exposure of caregivers in the surgical theater is recommended. For instance, with open surgery, surgeons should attempt to avoid exposure to aerosolized viral particles and reduce operative times.",

In the emergency of the healthcare crisis, first uncontrolled data generated expectations but were also subjected to a high degree of controversy. In data published thus far, there are no subgroup analyses for patients with cancer. However, publications of upcoming clinical trials should be scrutinized for subgroup analyses of patients with cancer. Moreover, several clinical trials specifically designed for patients with cancer are ongoing, which may help in our understanding of how patients with cancer should be treated for COVID-19 infection. The use of antiviral therapy outside clinical trials in COVID-19-infected patients remains controversial. Thus far, limited data are available in patients with cancer. In the report from the Wuhan cohort of patients during the Chinese COVID-19 outbreak [13] , antiviral agents were used empirically in 20 (71.4%) patients, including arborol in 14 (50%) patients, lopinavir/ritonavir in ten (35.7%) patients, ganciclovir in nine (32.1%) patients, and ribavirin in one (3.6%) patient; nine (32.1%) patients received combinations of several antiviral agents. Systemic corticosteroids were given to 15 (53.6%) patients, mainly in severe cases (12 patients). Moreover, intravenous immunoglobin was prescribed to 12 (35.7%) patients. These data did not report benefits in outcome or conversion from mild to severe cases in this patient population. No safety concerns were reported. However, this patient population remains limited. Including patients with cancer in antiviral treatment registries and clinical trials investigating COVID-19 antiviral therapies is highly advisable. Although very limited information is available, the use of anticancer agents concomitantly with antiviral therapy outside clinical trials is not recommended to avoid unpredicted pharmacokinetic interactions and toxicity, as previously described with antiviral agents for hepatitis B [22] .",

For many cancers, earlier stages of cancer and lack of delay in diagnosis and therapy are associated with significant benefits in terms of morbidity and mortality. Postponed diagnoses and treatment delays are usually regarded as detrimental factors for patients with cancer [24] . However, it is becoming more difficult to convince of the importance of maintaining functional cancer wards in healthcare institutions currently focused in short-term emergency care following nationwide mobilizations in response to COVID-19 infection. In many places, difficulties are currently observed in mobilizing diagnosis, surgery, radiation oncology, medical oncology, hematology units, and their professionals, some of whom are off duty due to caregiver infections. Oncology societies have rapidly provided specific recommendations for various tumor types in trying to maintain essential actions for cancer care according to staging and prognosis, suggesting postponing non-essential imaging in cancer survivors, and attempting to limit the frequency of medical therapy in currently treated patients to avoid contamination during in-hospital visits. For instance, it has been proposed that some cancer surgeries are delayed toxicity during trials and/or because monitoring and assurance quality for safety could not be continued due to limited human resources including Clinical Research Associates or postponed using neoadjuvant therapies. Carrying out radiotherapy may become complex [25] . More specifically, COVID-19 protection during transportation of patients for daily treatment, protection of professional (manipulators, physicists, radiotherapists, etc.), and disinfection of radiotherapy equipment during therapies have been regarded as potential factors limiting treatment availability in several centers [26] . Moreover, difficulty in carrying out chemotherapy and other medical treatments for cancer (availability and protection of teams, risks of aplasia, estimation of risk benefit, etc.) is making it difficult to maintain quality of care in medical oncology. Although medical society recommendations may be relatively easy to implement in comprehensive cancer centers, they may be more difficult to implement in university and community hospitals and clinics. Furthermore, low evidence-based medicine specifically developed during COVID-19 outbreak may be subject to individual legal actions from patients and families if it can be demonstrated that casualty was related to a lack of optimal patient care at the completion of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

As healthcare providers are reorganized to provide high priority to the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of hospital beds and availability of the healthcare workforces are being observed, asking professionals in charge of chronic diseases including cancer to postpone diagnosis and treatment. As a result, the COVID-19 outbreak is currently having a profound impact on cancer care. Most actions aiming at prevention, screening, and early diagnosis of cancer are currently on hold or are severely restricted. In most cancer wards, initiatives have been immediately placed to protect patients with active or a prior history of cancer. However, in routine practice, restricting in-hospital visits aiming at avoiding contagious contacts for patients with cancer often results in postponing primary diagnosis and delaying complex hightech therapies such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy/immunotherapy [31] . How much normalization of cancer diagnostics and therapy will be possible after the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown, but will be highly dependent on the ability of healthcare systems to resume standard activities without being flooded with delayed cancer care. Moreover, the duration of the outbreak (which is still unknown) is likely to last for at least 3 months, a duration that may be associated with cancer progression that could impact the prognosis of several patients. Furthermore, medical societies have also implemented low-evidence-based but convenient recommendations during COVID-19 outbreak to balance standard-ofcare requirements and healthcare accessibility. As early diagnosis and quality of evidence-based cancer therapy have been the driving forces behind reducing cancer mortality for the last 50 years, the current COVID-19 outbreak is likely to have an indirect mid-term impact on cancer-related mortality.

Without containment measures, the economy would be contracted by about 7% within a year but as many as 500,000 additional lives would be lost; this would translate into a loss of about $6.1 trillion [33] .",

            "text": "While it is currently difficult to anticipate the medical consequences of the post-COVID-19 economic crisis, data deriving from the subprime mortgage crisis may help in identifying factors with an impact on diagnosis and mid-term cancer mortality. For instance, data from the California Cancer Registry data showed that the cancer incidence rate declined yearly by 3.3% in males and 1.4% in females during the USA recession/recovery period [34] . This decrease in cancer incidence affected particularly male patients with prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers and female patients with breast cancer, melanoma, and ovarian cancer. The decreased incidence was associated with unemployment and may have occurred as a result of decreased engagement in prevention and early diagnosis, particularly for malignancies that may have been considered clinically less urgent cancers. On a global perspective, data from the World Bank and WHO generated from more than 2 billion people from 1990 to 2010 showed that rises in unemployment were significantly associated with an increase in all-cancer mortality and all specific cancers except lung cancer in women [35] . These data have highlighted that the 2008-2010 economic crisis was associated with about 260,000 excess cancer-related deaths in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Universal health coverage and publicsector expenditure on healthcare were shown to protect against this excess in cancer mortality rate. Altogether, an increased mortality rate is expected in patients with cancer as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 infection and a remote aftermath effect on the outbreak on the global economy. High-performing health systems are expected to be sufficiently resilient to the consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic and may hopefully be more able to counteract the remote impact on cancer mortality.",

Patients with cancer and healthcare providers are exposed to similar stresses, with the addition of facing the diagnosis and treatment of a dreadful disease. Relatives who usually accompany patients for diagnosis, treatment, and palliative care are discouraged from visiting patients in hospitals. As a result, frontline healthcare workers have become the main people to provide psychological interventions to patients in hospitals. Professionals who are devoted to their patients are facing the risk of contamination at work for themselves and their relatives. In oncology wards, reinforcement should be made in terms of identifying professional teams that comprise mental health personnel as a basic tenet in dealing with emotional distress for patients with cancer and healthcare providers. Furthermore, careful follow-up of lonely patients with cancer confined at home can be proposed, using telephone or video consultation, taking advantage of the availability of many home-confined mental health professionals [37] .",

Consistently, the majority of pharmaceutical or academic sponsors have provided official guidance to investigative sites to hold whenever possible new screenings and inclusions until the resolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, with the exception of urgent cases (such as particular life-threatening situations in hematology). Instead, hematology and oncology research teams have to focus on maintaining the safety of patients already included in ongoing trials via reinforced monitoring and optimized communication with the sponsor. Detecting and scrutinizing the onset of COVID-19 infection symptoms in patients treated with innovative anticancer therapeutics is mandatory for optimal reporting to the sponsor and for early management of research patients. Remote instead of on-site monitoring may be proposed to maintain realtime close collaboration between investigators and sponsor representatives. This can ensure the quality and contemporaneous assessment of data, and partially limit the accumulation of monitoring duties during the post-COVID-19 aftermath period. On the other hand, patients with cancer treated outside prospective oncology trials and developing COVID-19 infection may participate in clinical research projects under development against COVID-19 infection if they comply with inclusion criteria, their history of cancer being one among other possible concomitant morbidities, and given the fact that anticancer therapy is likely to be halted until they recover from COVID-19 infection.",

Infestations from non-symptomatic reservoirs occurring after the initial epidemic peak may result in the maintenance of COVID-19 infection with remnant waves of COVID-19 cases occurring as a result of transient releases of home containment. Altogether, it is likely that protection of patients and healthcare providers may be required for several weeks or months until at least 80% of the population develop post-infection immunity or (still non-available) vaccination (Fig. 2) . Whenever available, serological COVID-19 diagnosis may facilitate the identification of immune patients and healthcare workers who are no longer at risk for COVID-19 infection. Until this time, all protection procedures, including COVID-19-free oncology wards, will have to be maintained. Most of the healthcare systems will have to promptly reorganize themselves to prioritize the rescheduling of patients who have been postponed for diagnosis and treatments during the wave of COVID-19 infection. Patients underdiagnosed during the COVID-19 home containment may also appear with urgent needs for diagnosis and care at the end of the wave of infection. Further, many patients and primary-care physicians distracted by the COVID-19 infection for whom guidelines were to avoid contact with hospital facilities during the COVID-19 outbreak, may be reluctant and afraid to resume usual contacts with hospital Fig. 2 The COVID-19 outbreak multistep crisis. Each country (one after another) foresees multiple-step crises. New COVID-19 infections may occur during all stages wards. Moreover, fatigue as well as the impact of income from the economic recession for healthcare providers is a parameter that is yet difficult to estimate, but may be a limiting factor to containing the anticipated increased post-COVID-19 activity.",
