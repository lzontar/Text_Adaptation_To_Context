People without the bracelet will still be asked to practice social-distancing and stay away from work and school.

It requires that patients with IgG antibodies are functionally immune, don't have confounding anti-bodies in response to another virus (unlikely in the prime-age population), aren't shedding the active virus, and have long-term immunity so they don't get reinfected. This may require testing for both viral RNA and antibodies-both are possible now in a point of care setting. Early evidence from China is that within two weeks of exposure, 100% of patients have the relevant antibodies [1] , but this could be verified for US patients who have cleared the virus.",
