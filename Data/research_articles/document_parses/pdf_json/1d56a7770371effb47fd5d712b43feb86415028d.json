It is also regarded as a serious complication after renal transplantation, which frequently needs comprehensive management. The 28-day mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe pneumonia in our center prior 2009 was as high as 50 % which was consistent with a literature report [2] . Accordingly, we have implemented an interdisciplinary approach for renal transplant recipients with severe pneumonia involving the intensivists and transplant surgeons since 2009 in order to improve the outcome of these patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 132, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 441, "end": 444, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Fifty-three renal recipients who fulfilled the criteria of severe pneumonia [3] were admitted to the ICU from 2009 to 2012. Thirty patients were diagnosed with ARDS [4] on ICU admission or during the course of treatment in the ICU. All patients received oxygen therapy via face mask on admission, of which 33 (62.3 %) patients received non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for progressive hypoxia. Only one patient underwent endotracheal intubation immediately because of severe hypoxia and dyspnea.

Empirical antibiotic therapy included moxifloxacin, ganciclovir, and trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Antifungal drug was administered in cases with suspected or confirmed fungal infection [5] . Fourteen (7.5 %) patients had a definitive microbial diagnosis by non-invasive diagnostic tests. In the remaining 39 patients, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 35 (66 %) patients, but only 10 patients had positive findings.

The estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the time of ICU discharge was 65 \u00b1 14 mL/min, which was close to mean renal function on ICU admission (63 \u00b1 12 mL/min, P = 0.138). Three patients required hemofiltration or hemodialysis during ICU stay and only one patient depended on dialysis at ICU discharge. Despite the aggressive withdrawal or reduction of the immunosuppressants, none of them were reported to experience any evident acute rejection episodes during the 6 months follow-up. Our work identified timely admission to ICU, aggressive investigations of microbial ecology, and early empirical treatment as the elements we should focus on to save lives. Depending on our preliminary experience, aggressive immunosuppressant dosage reduction and glucocorticoids (GCs) replacement was safe and associated with minimal risk of acute graft loss. However, the relatively small sample size of the study and lack of a control group prevented us from drawing definite conclusions on the effectiveness and safety of the interdisciplinary approach.",
