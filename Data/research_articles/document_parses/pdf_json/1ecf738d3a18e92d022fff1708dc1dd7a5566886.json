Basically, the target domain data is related to the source domain data in terms of knowledge/characteristics but differs in terms of the domain shift in the distribution. Therefore, the fundamental idea in these methods is to draw the source and target domain distributions close to each other using a distribution discrepancy measure. The concept of the domain adaptation method is presented in Fig. 1 ., where the shared features are expected to be learned from different domains, to perform accurate diagnosis. In this way, the learned knowledge from the source domain can be generalized to the target domain. [10] proposed to simultaneously minimize the distance of intra-class variations and maximize the distance of inter-class variations, through the learned representations of multiple hidden layers of a CNN, for bearing fault diagnosis. Kim et al. [11] implemented the concept of selective parameter freezing, wherein only a portion of model parameters are frozen, and remaining parameters within a layer are fine tuned to avoid overfitting to a small number of target data samples.

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved remarkable merits in various domains, mainly due to their distinguishing characteristics, such as shared network weights and spatial subsampling. The architectural framework of CNN used in this study is depicted in Fig. 2 . In general, the architecture mainly consists of three layers: 1) convolutional layer; 2) pooling layer and 3) fully connected (FC) layer. The convolutional layer contains a number of filters which are convolved with the raw data. The idea behind using a number of filters is that, different filters would detect/identify a different set of features when convolved with the input data.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 124, "end": 128, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 396, "end": 402, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Proposed Network Architecture"}, {"text": "In this study, a 1D-CNN architecture is used for fault diagnosis. Initially, all the raw input training data is arranged in a two-dimensional (2D) format, with its dimension in the form of Ns x Ndim, where Ns is the number of samples and Ndim is the sample dimension. With respect to each sample, the data dimension is, thus, Ndim. There are three stacked 1-D convolutional layers in the network, for feature extraction purpose, that have the same configuration, which involves NF filters with size LF. As the number and size of each filter in each layer of the network significantly affects the network performance, the filter number is kept as 50 and the filter length is also selected as 50 in this research work. These hyperparameters gave the most optimum results after running multiple experiments, while fine-tuning the network. During convolution, zero-padding operation is used to prevent changes At the end, a softmax classifier with ten neurons, representing the ten health classes respectively, is used, to predict the fault condition class. The leaky ReLU (rectified linear units) [18] is used as the activation function in the network, as it does not undergo gradient diffusion or vanishing during network training process and provides better performance in deep architectures. In each layer, the Xavier kernel initializer is used for initialization of weights and biases [19] and Adam algorithm [20] is adopted for network optimization. The parameters defining each layer in the proposed network architecture have been presented in Table 1 .

The test rig is shown in Fig. 4 . The vibration data recorded from two motor loads of 0 and 3 HP, corresponding to motor speeds of 1797 and 1730 RPM, is considered respectively. Three kinds of machine faults are implemented, i.e. inner race fault (IRF), ball fault (BF) and outer race fault (ORF). The faults ranging in diameter of 0.007, 0.014 and 0.021 inch, were seeded on the drive-end (DE) bearings (SKF deep-groove ball bearings: 6205-2RS JEM) of the motor at different locations. Therefore, a total number of 10 health conditions are considered in this paper. For the ease of classification, these 10 health classes with different locations of faults (IRF, BF and ORF) and different fault severities (0.007\", 0.014\" and 0.021\") are set as class labels 1 to 10 respectively.

As seen in the figure, the results clearly indicate that, the proposed noisy label CNN-based cross domain adaptation methodology achieves the highest testing diagnosis performance among all techniques in different tasks. The traditional machine learning models (SVM and k-NN) lead to poor generalization when source domain data is applied directly to the target domain data. In contrast, TCA (domain adaptation technique) performs significantly better than the traditional machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, CNNwith domain adaptation and without the use of noisy labels provides higher diagnosis performance relative to CNNwithout domain adaptation results (for both, with and without the use of noisy labels). However, incorporation of noisy labels in the source domain data improves the performance of CNN model with domain adaptation methodology and confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In order to better evaluate the proposed noisy label algorithm, different tests were conducted by varying the level of injected noise, in small increments, and observing the corresponding changes in testing accuracy. The results of these tests are summarized in Fig. 6 . It can be observed that smaller additional noise in the labels, generally leads to noticeable improvement in the testing accuracies. However, when strong noise is introduced, the performance deteriorates. For instance, the testing accuracy suddenly drops by almost 3%, when the noise level crosses 0.25. Hence, based on these results, an optimal noise level of nrange = 0.25 is selected, and a random noise number in the range of [0, 0.25] is generated during each training epoch, to form the required noisy labels in this study. The reason for the performance improvement after using noisy labels, mostly lies in the strong regularization introduced by the algorithm. Data diversity is much enhanced, and model randomness is increased, that significantly results in better generalization ability. On one hand, the noisy label can be 89 It should be pointed out that in this study, the integration of the domain adaptation and noisy label techniques is proposed to address the challenging cross-domain fault diagnosis problem. Using the noisy label alone, without domain adaptation, will inevitably introduce additional noise, which deteriorates the performance of the model.
