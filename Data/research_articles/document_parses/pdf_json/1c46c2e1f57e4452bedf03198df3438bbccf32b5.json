The World Health Organisation (WHO) and several countries have already prepared these questions by taking ethics into account when planning management of a hypothetical global influenza pandemic [1] , most of the time without being able to offer clear guidelines. In France, the National Consultative Ethics Committee (Comit\u00e9 consultatif national d'\u00e9thique -CCNE) published a document in 2009 on \"the ethical questions raised by a possible influenza pandemic\", a text which served as the basis for the urgent drafting of a new document, published on March 13th, 2020 concerning the Covid-19 pandemic [2] . In this text, ten important points have been identified:",

However, the issues highlighted by the CCNE, such as the attention paid to precarious populations, maintaining access to healthcare for all and international communication and cooperation, are important in our specialty. According to preliminary feedback from ENT colleagues at this stage of the pandemic, several aspects stand out, enumerated below.",

Performing flexible nasal endoscopy in the office has become complicated with an insufficient availability of FFP2 masks. The risk for the patient is twofold, of delayed diagnosis and of increased contamination risk during transport for medical reasons. National recommendations also suggest cancelling any elective surgery that can be delayed by two months. However, this decision may be difficult to take in cases of progressive diseases, especially when collective decision-making is not possible, with a significant risk of post-crisis legal actions. Even oncology cases, although prioritised, are sometimes impacted to limit necessity of ICU or tracheostomy.",

The chloroquine controversy, often more an emotionally heated than scientific debate, has recently been at the forefront of discussions between patients and their ENTs and between colleagues, overshadowing other important issues. Conversely, the numerous recommendations posted online on the National French ORL Society (SFORL) website (https://www.sforl.org/actualites-Covid-19/) and the French National ENT Academy, with the participation of the French ORL National Syndicate (SNORL) and the French ORL National Professional Council (CNP ORL) are part of a transparent and up-to-date communication strategy at a national but also international level. Professional online forums such as Doc@Doc also allow information to be relayed and experiences to be crossed leading to notable scientific advances (as was the case for anosmia).",

To continue this reflection, the Ethics Committee of the CNP ORL (CEORL), currently being rehauled, is available to collect questions from ENTs and to reflect with the ENT community on these subjects. According to the different recommendations of the French scientific societies, the CEORL certainly remains available to review certain ethical choices, would ENT specialists require it, keeping in mind that it seems of paramount importance that decisions be taken within the local teams, on a case-by-case basis and depending on the local context, which can change rapidly.",
