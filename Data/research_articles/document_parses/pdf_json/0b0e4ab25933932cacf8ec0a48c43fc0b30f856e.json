In comparison with the CRD group, RJ and RJ + TRF remarkably enhanced the uncoupling protein1 (UCP1) expression in WAT (5.81, 4.72 fold, P < 0.001) and BAT (4.99, 4 .75 fold, P < 0.001).

            "text": "In addition to classical BAT, a phenomenon called \"browning or beigeing procedure\" has been demonstrated including the development of brite adipocytes in classical WAT [7] [8] [9] . It is suggested that, some stimulants such as cold exposure, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimuli, exercise, PPARs agonists, pharmacological agents, and some food components may develop brite or beige adipocytes [1, 10] . Browning of WAT protects against obesity through increasing energy consumption, which can lead to a negative energy balance [1, 7] . It is speculated that, PR domain containing16 (PRDM16), Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBP\u03b2) are the master regulators, which their interactions participate in the UCP1 gene regulation that ultimately contribute to BAT activation or WAT remodeling [11] [12] [13] [14] . Identification of the food components that can induce the browning represents as an attractive potential way in obesity treatment. Royal Jelly (RJ) is a yellowish-white, multifunctional creamy material secreted from the hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of nurse honeybees [15] . The main components of RJ are 10-hydroxy-Trans-2-decenoic acid (HDEA) and Hydroxydecanoic acid ( HDAA), and main biological activities of RJ attribute to them [16] . RJ has multiple biological functions such as antioxidant, antitumor, antiaging, antihypercholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, hypoglycemic, radio-protective, gastro-protective, hepato-protective, and vasodilative effects [17] . RJ caused a remarkable decrease in body weight and abdominal fat depots and also an increase in skeletal muscle mass in High-fat diet (HFD) induced obese rats [18] . Nevertheless, the exact effects of RJ on the regulation of thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue have not been defined yet, as well as the procedure by which RJ ameliorate obesity is not exactly figured out. Vitamin E is a lipid-soluble nutrient, composed of two biologically active Tocopherols (TP) and Tocotrienols (T3) subclasses with eight analogs each one including \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-forms [19] . Most of the studies on vitamin E have concentrated on TPs; therefore, very little is known about T3s. Main food resources of T3s are rice bran, oat, wheat germ, palm oil, and annatto oil. T3s have been indicated to possess various physiological activities including neuroprotective, anticancer, antiangiogenesis, anti-tumor, cardiovascular-protective, hypocholesterolemic, and antiinflammatory properties [20, 21] . However, T3s effect on obesity management and its related metabolic challenges have been less assessed up to now, compared with saturated matched TPs, and also the chief mechanisms of action in obesity regulation are still unknown [19] . Gammatocotrienol is the most common T3 isomer and is physiologically more available compared to other isomers [22] . By considering the unsuccessful methods of obesity control and the adverse consequence of long-term calorie restriction on energy expenditure and thermogenesis, applying functional foods with the properties of thermogenesis improvement would be profitable. Up to the best of our knowledge, the potential effects of royal jelly and \u03b3tocotrienol on white fat browning and thermogenesis induction during calorie restriction diet has not been examined yet. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of royal jelly, \u03b3-tocotrienol, and their combinations on the induction of genes involved in the beige phenotype appearance in WAT and also BAT activation using molecular involved mechanisms in obesity models of rats during calorie restriction diet ( CRD).",

(Fig. 1 ) After 1 week of acclimatization, 50 rats were administered a HFD to induce the obesity model and five rats received normal chow diet as the control group for HFD receiving rats. All rats had free access to food and water in this phase of the study. Semi-purified HFD consisted of standard chow powder mixed with milk butter (40% w/ w). The compositions of the diets used in the study are shown in Table 1 . HFD was prepared every 2 days freshly in the form of pellets and kept at 4\u00b0C to maintain nutrients. We weighted animals every week. At the end of the 17th weeks, the mean weight of HFD administered rats increased significantly compared to normal chow diet consuming rats (443.28 g \u00b1 46.62 g vs 396.24 g \u00b128.79 g P < 0.05), indicating that HFD induced obesity model was accomplished. At the second phase, rats were randomly allocated to one of 5 groups (n = 10/group) using a randomized block procedure which matched for body weight and treated for 8 weeks as follows 1) RJ group receiving lyophilized RJ powder (100 mg/kg/day) orally dissolved in CRD 2) Tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF) group receiving TRF (85 mg/kg/day) orally dissolved in CRD 3) RJ + TRF group receiving both 100 mg/kg/day lyophilized RJ powder and 85 mg/kg/day TRF orally dissolved in CRD 4) CRD group; without any supplementation as control for RJ, TRF and RJ + TRF groups and 5) HFD group; HFD without any supplementation as control for CRD group. CRD had the same macronutrient composition as HFD (Table 1 ), but the calorie content was 30% lower than the ad libitum intake of HFD. RJ and TRF were added to CRD and the food was weighed, then given to rats every day in certain time schedules (between 9:00-9:30 AM).HFD was fed ad libitum and given to rats every day.",

As anticipated, along with weight loss, CRD downregulated the UCP1 levels by 36 and 14% in WAT and BAT respectively compare to HDF-fed rats, although there were no statistically significant (P \u2265 0.05) (Fig. 3a) . We next tested whether RJ and TRF supplementation with CRD would be able to ameliorate the aforementioned effects of CRD on the UCP1 levels. Our data demonstrated that RJ added in CRD rats led to a significant elevation of UCP1 in comparison with the CRD-matched group in WAT and BAT as depicted in Fig. 3b (P < 0.001). We also observed that TRF induced the UCP1 levels in both adipose tissues compared to the CRD group, although it was not statistically significant (P \u2265 0.05). Furthermore, RJ + TRF significantly induced the UCP1 levels in comparison to the CRD-matched group (P < 0.001). However, the enhancing effects of RJ on UCP1 expression was superior. Next, we examined the effects of RJ and TRF on key brown fat marker PRDM16. As depicted in Fig. 3c mRNA levels of PRDM16 was increased significantly about 4.65-fold and 2.80-fold in WAT and BAT in the RJ group respectively relative to CRD group (P < 0.001). Whereas, TRF did not remarkably up-regulate the PRDM16 expression in none of the adipose tissues (P \u2265 0.05). Moreover, gene expression of PRDM16 upregulated significantly in the RJ + TRF group to 4.30 and 2.61 -fold in WAT and BAT respectively in comparison with the CRD group (P < 0.001).To further investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the browning effects of RJ and TRF, we determined expression levels of CREB1 and CEBP\u03b2, the master regulators of the thermogenic program. Gene expression of CREB1 increased significantly by RJ addition to 5.85 and 5 fold relative to CRD group in WAT and BAT respectively (P < 0.001).However, TRF treatment did not affect the expression of CREB1 in comparison with the CRD group (P \u2265 0.05). Furthermore, combinations of RJ + TRF markedly increased CREB1 expression in WAT and BAT relative to the CRD group (P < 0.001, Fig. 3d) .

Although Calorie restriction (CR) through confining energy intake is the most common lifestyle dietary intervention to protect against weight gain, it is ineffective in the long-term, since thermogenic adoptions, as defensive mechanisms, diminish the energy expenditure to stop energy depletion [2] [3] [4] 27] . Therefore, stimulation of BAT development in WAT (socalled browning) or increasing BAT function to enhance energy expenditure would be considered as promising approaches to manage adiposity. Up to the best of our knowledge, it is the first research investigated the browning and thermogenesis properties of Royal jelly and \u03b3tocotrienol in the obesity model of rats during CRD. In this study, we demonstrated that, RJ decreased During 8 weeks of CRD, we noted insignificant reductions in UCP1 expression in WAT and BAT concomitant with weight loss about 36 and 14% in comparison to HFD-fed obese rats, respectively. Accordingly, this might be an adaptive response (whitening) to the limited calorie intake or a negative energy balance. However, since the reduction in the UCP-1 level was not significant, this notion needs more investigations to be approved. Reduction in UCP1 expression throughout CR is in line with other previously performed studies [2, 3] .",

Therefore, we investigated the molecular changes in thermogenic machinery following the addition of RJ and \u03b3tocotrienol into CRD-fed rats. Our results showed that, 8 weeks of RJ administration (100 mg/kg/day) to obese rats underwent CRD enhanced the UCP1 expression levels in both adipocytes. Consistent with these findings, Yoneshiro et al. reported that, 5% lyophilized RJ powder in HFD-induced obese rats enhanced UCP1 mRNA expression in BAT, but not in WAT without modifying food intake, which suggest the possible augmentation of thermogenesis in BAT and energy expenditure [28] . It was suggested that, RJ attenuated the adverse effects of CR on thermogenesis via increasing BAT activity and WAT remodeling. However, TRF (85 mg/kg/day) added into CRD -fed rats was not efficient Fig. 4 Effect of RJ, TRF and TRF + RJ treatment on the expression of BMP8B gene in WAT, BAT, and hypothalamus (a) and expression of BMP7 gene in WAT and BAT vs. CRD quantified by qRT-PCR. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 10). ***P < 0.001 by one-way ANOVA in the up-regulation of UCP1 and also other thermogenic regulators in adipose tissues. However, several studies revealed the positive thermogenic effects of other vitamin E analogs (\u03b1-tocopherol and \u03b4 tocopherol) in UCP1 gene induction in WAT of rats and also mouse preadipocytes [29, 30] . In our study, TRF was used comprised of all isoforms of tocotrienols along with \u03b1tocopherol. It is speculated that, \u03b1tocopherol can interact with tocotrienols and represses their activities, and also other isomers of tocotrienol in TRF may produce a synergistic or antagonistic impact with \u03b3tocotrienol; and therefore, may affect the outcomes. Thus, a pure isomer of \u03b3tocotrienol may provide different results. In this study, we confirmed that, RJ + TRF combined treatment in CRD obese rats significantly induced the expression of hallmark protein of thermogenesis, UCP1, and almost other thermogenic genes mRNA in both adipose tissues. Bearing in mind that, TRF has no remarkable effect on UCP1 and other regulators of thermogenic program expression, and the UCP1s induction is attributed to RJ treatment in the RJ + TRF group. Hence, in the present investigation, we mechanistically explored the thermoregulatory and browning potency of RJ.",

            "text": "Recent studies found out new transcriptional components such as PRDM16, C/EBP\u03b2, and CEREB1, which control BAT development and promote brown adipogenesis in inducible WAT. PRDM16 induces thermogenic program by interacting with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR\u03b3) C/EBP\u03b2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) in the regulatory promoter site of the UCP1 gene [8, 32, 33] . Our data revealed that, RJ treatment for CDR-fed obese rats induced PRDM16 and CREB1 mRNA levels; however, it did not induce C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA in both WAT and BAT. It was identified that, HDEA and HDAA, as the main functional compounds in RJ, are responsible for its biological activity [16] . Also, HDEA and HDAA act as agonists of temperature-sensitive Transient receptor potential (TRPs) channels, specially TRPA1 in sensory neurons of the gastrointestinal tract, provoke thermogenesis via a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-mediated pathway in classic brown and inducible white adipocytes, and in addition, simulate cold-induced non-shivering thermogenesis [16] .Therefore, in this study, the TRP-SNS-UCP1 pathway activity is the proposed mechanism for thermoregulatory effects or RJ. Figure 7 demonstrate the suggested molecular mechanisms of RJ effect on thermogenesis induction and browning of WAT. Despite the increasing trends, we found no significant effects of TRF treatment on PRDM16, C/EBP\u03b2, and CEREB1 induction during 8-week experiment. The reason why the expression of key thermoregulatory components was not remarkably up-regulated by TRF, remains currently unclear; however, the inhibitory effect of \u03b1-tocopherol on the absorption of \u03b3-tocotrienol and suppression of its activity, insufficient doses of TRF or limitations of treatment duration may be the reasons. The downstream molecular signaling in the TRP-SNS-UCP1 pathway mainly includes discharging of norepinephrine from the sympathetic nerve terminals; provoking the tissue that mostly acting through \u03b23-adrenergic receptors; and finally cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activation. Phosphorylated PKA leads to the P38MAPK phosphorylation, which in turn activates CREB1 and PGC1-\u03b1 coactivators, and ultimately results in transcription of UCP1 [32] . Also, the proposed pathways are depicted in Fig. 7 . The P38MAPK signaling has been defined as one of the important pathways triggering beiging and thermogenic machinery in various models [8] . Our results robustly demonstrated the potency of RJ, but not TRF, to induce the P38MAPK mRNA level in white and brown adipose tissues of CRD-fed rats. Therefore, these data support the theory of agonistic activity of RJ at TRPA1 channels in the TRP-SNS-UCP1 pathway.",

BMP7 promotes the differentiation of brown preadipocytes to mature brown adipocyte through PRDM16, PGC-1\u03b1 induction, and the increased expression of UCP1 by P38MAPK dependent pathways [13] . BMP8Bs are signaling molecules, which are mostly expressed and active in mature BAT and also Central nervous system (CNS).Therefore, BMP8B has both central and peripheral actions, which its consonant performance in CNS and BAT can regulate thermogenesis and energy balance through the increased response to noradrenaline in mature BAT and the enhancement of p38MAPK/CREB signaling [12, 34] . Moreover, in the brain, BMP8B can increase the level of thermogenesis sympathetic activation. Our data demonstrated that, RJ but not TRF added to CRD induced the expression of BMP8B in BAT, WAT, and hypothalamus. Although the molecular mechanism by which RJ induced the BMP8B, is not known yet, it is suggested that, RJ may cooperate with BMP8B to increase the response to noradrenaline in adrenergic receptors and trigger the thermogenic program (Fig. 7) . Despite the increment of the BMP7 mRNA level resulted from RJ treatment, it did not reach a significant level.

            "text": "These findings suggest an important role for RJ in obesity treatment, and moreover, these outcomes expand our vision toward dietary compounds and fat browning factors, and also propose a new approach in the treatment of obesity through the browning process of adipose tissue. It was the first study assessing the effects of RJ and TRF on CRD -fed obese rats; however, there are few limitations on it. We used no genetically modified rats to confirm the involvement of RJ firmly in TRP-SNS-UCP1 axis. Therefore, further studies using TRPs or UCP-1 Knockout models or performing the treatments with \u03b2-adrenergic blockers seem highly desirable to support the proposed pathway. Also, we found no striking effect of TRF on BAT thermogenesis and/or browning of WAT, since all isoforms of tocotrienols and also \u03b1-tocopherol are available in TRF. Therefore, interpreting the results would be difficult, due to the possible interactions of tocopherol and tocotrienols. Also, additional studies with single \u03b3-tocotrienol are required to fill these knowledge gaps. Fig. 7 Suggested pathways for browning of white adipose tissue and brown fat activation by RJ. RJ with agonistic activity, activate temperaturesensitive TRP channels in the GI, triggering thermogenesis through the activation of the TRP-SNS-UCP1 axis. \u03923-AR (\u03b23-adrenoceptor), BMP8B (bone morphogenetic protein8B), cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), CREB1 (cAMP response element-binding protein1), NE (norepinephrine), PRDM16 (PR domain containing16), PPAR\u03b3 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma), PGC-1\u03b1 (peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha), PPAR\u03b1 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha), P38 MAPK (P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase), PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase A), TRP (transient receptor potential) and UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1)",
