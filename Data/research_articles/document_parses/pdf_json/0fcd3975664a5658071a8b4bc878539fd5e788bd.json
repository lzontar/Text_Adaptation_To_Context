Our findings show that a premature lockdown barely shifts the epidemic in time: moreover, beyond a critical value of the lockdown strength, an epidemic that seems to be quelled fully recovers after lifting the restrictions. We investigate the effects on lockdown scenarios and exit strategies by introducing heterogeneities in the model. In particular, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities in which social interactions through different age classes occur. We find that, due to the sparsity of the mobility matrix, epidemics develop independently in different regions once the outbreak starts. Moreover, after the epidemics ha started, the influence of contacts with other regions becomes soon irrelevant. Sparsity might be responsible for the observed delays among different regions. Analogous arguments apply to the world/countries scenario. We also find that disregarding the structure of social contacts could lead to severe underestimation of the post-lockdown effects. Nevertheless, age class based strategies can help to mitigate rebound effects with milder strategies. Finally, we point out that these results can be generalized beyond this particular model by providing a description of the effects of key parameters on non-medical epidemic mitigation strategies.",

Despite the sophistication of epidemic models, they often still lack important aspects, like the failure to include economic aspects (see [2, 3, 4] ) or, in the case of human epidemics, to assess the influence of media communication [5] . At the moment, although the World Health Organization (WHO) organizes regular calls for Covid-19 modelers to compare strategies and outcomes, policymakers find difficult to handle the discrepancies between the proposed models 1 : while uncertainty and complexity are accustomed traveling companions for scientists, they are possibly the worst scenario for decision makers.",

These restrictions have led to the disruption of business activities in many economic sectors and areas. Furthermore, the age class of 15-64 years, those engaged in the labor force, account for the majority of Covid-19 infections [7] . Hence, the impact of contagion and lockdown measures on economic activities appear to be substantial and pervasive. As a consequence, disposable incomes will drop significantly during the outbreak; consumption by households will also decrease and the closure of schools could result in lost education with long-term effects on human capital accumulation. Thus, the socio-economic implications of the Covid-19 are likely to play a detrimental impact not only on public health systems, but also on several production sectors and retail markets and, possibly, on wider global value chains.",

In particular, we study how to schedule shortterm interventions in response to an emerging epidemic when geographic and demographic variables are accounted in the model. We are indeed interested in analyzing how mobility restriction measures and the timing of the lockdown release might affect the total fraction of infected, the peak prevalence, and, possibly, the delay of the epidemic when model heterogeneity is driven by regional boundaries and age classes [8] . To such an end, we use a very general compartmental model, minimally adapted to describe Italian data, and we analyze the effect of disregarding regional compartmentalization and age classes. Notice that our results are general for the vast class of epidemic models where transmission rate is proportional to the number of susceptible people times the density of infected. In a nutshell, our scope is to understand which dimensions, beside medical ones, should be considered and available to leverage strategies for containing epidemic even before having detailed quantitative predictions. Secondly, we also aim to point out how disregarding such dimensions in epidemic models could seriously affect exit scenarios.",

Our projections show that an anticipated lockdown just shifts the epidemic in time, with a delay proportional to the anticipation time and grows with the strength of the lockdown. Moreover, beyond a critical lockdown strength, while at the beginning the epidemic seems to be quelled, it fully recovers its strength as soon as the lockdown is lifted. If we consider regional mobility flows, due to the sparsity of the mobility matrix, epidemics develop independently in different regions once the epidemic is started. We postulate that the sparsity of the inter-regional mobility matrix could be responsible of the delays observed among different regions and that the same consideration may apply to explain the independent dynamic of the epidemic spreading in different countries. Finally, if we add social contact heterogeneity on different age classes we find that the structure of social contacts is of primarily importance for avoiding an underestimation of the post-lockdown effects and that age class based strategies can help to mitigate rebound effects with milder strategies.",

Conversely, lifting the lockdown too soon can make epidemic start again and reach values even higher than the ones before the release. A very peculiar and counter-intuitive effect can be generated if the lockdown is anticipated: in fact, a too early lockdown has the effect of delaying the start of the epidemic without attenuating its severity (see Sec. 8.2).

Indeed, increasing the strength \u03b1 of the lockdown (i.e., reducing the social contacts) not only delays the time at which the lockdown can be lifted, but also induces a stronger reprise of the epidemic in the post-lockdown (see Sec. 8.2). Moreover, such approach could can result not sustainable for an economic system and motivate a gradual lifting of the lockdown measures to lessen the extant of further peaks. Furthermore, another counter-intuitive effect must be considered. Since to an attenuation \u03b1 corresponds an effective reproduction number R eff 0 = \u03b1R 0 , at the critical value \u03b1 crit = 1/R 0 the epidemic neither grows nor decreases. Thus, after t Lock the system stays stationary until the quarantine is released at t Unlock , and at this point the epidemic starts growing again as it was before the lockdown. In general, if \u03b1 < \u03b1 crit the system looks to ameliorate (infected, hospitalized, all the infective compartments go down) but as soon as the lockdown is lifted, the epidemic starts again to reach its full extent (see Sec. 8.2). Nevertheless, our estimate \u03b1 \u223c 0.5 > \u03b1 crit \u223c 0.3 for the Italian lockdown gives us hope that, perhaps, it will not be necessary to follow a repeated seek-and-release strategy in the post-lockdown phase.

As a consequence, the growth curves of the epidemic variables should tend to the same shape (see Sec. 8.5). Coherently, looking at the regional infographics released by the Italian National Healthcare Institute (ISS) [19] , one may notice that they have a similar shape but different starting time (see Fig. 4 ). Such observation can be justified as follows: Italian regions are independent administrative units, where most of the population tend to work inside the resident region [29] . Hence, epidemics propagate from region to region via the fewer inter-regional exchanges (notice that Lombardy is among the Italian regions most involved in international trade connections [30] , hence it appears as one of the most probable candidate for the start of the Italian epidemic). More practically, we estimate these delays by minimizing the distance among the observed curves (see also Sec. 8.4); results are reported in Tab. 1. Notice that, assuming that Lombardy has been the first region (i.e. delay=0), the resulting regional delays are mostly correlated to geographical distances. We assume that the Covid-19 outbreak spreads independently in each region of Italy; as argued before, such an approximation is reasonable after the epidemic has started and is even more accurate under lockdown conditions. Hence, we apply the parameters for the whole Italy to regional cases, where now the maximum number of individuals N i is the population of the i th region. Then, by summing up all the S i , . . . , R i , respectively, we obtain the evolution of Covid-19 epidemic throughout Italy. To evaluate the effect of heterogeneity in time 9 .

In Fig. 4 we compare the effect of a region-to-region release of the lockdown respect to releasing the lockdown at the same time in all the regions for the case of Lazio and Lombardy: in the latter case, there is a risk of having regions that have started earlier the contagion to wait a too much long time, and to have regions that have started later to have a too much strong rebound. Since not only epidemics, but also the ruin of an economy is a non-linear process, the Sync scenario can turn out to be even more disruptive than the epidemic itself (see also Fig. 3 ).

Since the transmission coefficient is proportional to the contact rate of individuals, the rates of social mixing among different age classes could represent another important source of heterogeneity. This kind of information has been estimated either through large-scales surveys [24] or through virtual populations modeling [32] . While the POLYMOD [24] matrices have been extensively used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination for different age-classes during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [33, 34] , here we apply such matrices to the design of lockdown measures and exit strategies. Hence, to account for age classes, we extend our model by rewriting the transmission coefficient as \u03b2C (see Sec. 8.7), where \u03b2 is the transmission probability characteristic of the disease, and C is the sociological matrix describing the contact patterns typical of a nation. For lack of further information, we assume \u03b2 constant among age classes and C as in [24] . To simplify the analysis, we gather POLYMOD age groups into three classes: Y oung (00 \u2212 19), M iddle (20 \u2212 69) and Elderly (70+) (see Tab 2) . Such aggregation puts together the most \"contactful\" classes (00 \u2212 19), the classes with the highest mortality risk (70+) [19] , and the working class (20 \u2212 69). 12 .

We reveal how the promptness of lockdown measures has only a main effect on the timing of the contagion. More specifically, we show that strict social distancing policies reduce the extent of contagion during the lockdown period, but full recover occurs once such measures are relaxed. Interestingly, our study also contributes to uncover how local dynamics at regional level can be masked by observing the aggregate national system. Such regional heterogeneity, in fact, lowers and widens the curve of the contagion thus determining a shift forward in time for its peak at the aggregate national level. Moreover, by employing mobility data, we find that, due to the sparsity of interconnections across regions, contagion develops independently within each region once the epidemic is started. This, in turn, contributes to explain the delays observed in the alignment of the contagion curves across different geographical areas. Finally, we rely on the structure of social contacts to emphasize the role played by different age classes in the spreading of contagion. We notice that both young people (0-19) and elderly people (70+) are the most interconnected classes and therefore can have a greater influence on the post-lockdown phase. We show that while confirming quarantine policies to only elderly people can limit the possibility of a renewed upward phase in the contagion dynamics, relaxing the lockdown measures to only the middle age class can be enough to smooth and lessen the propagation of contagion in the post-lockdown phase.",

Such a framework can also guide policymakers in the assessment of the trade-off between the impacts on the health care systems and the effects on wider economy. In particular, our analysis reveals how the timeline of post-lockdown measures can benefit from the inclusion of compartmental aspects, such as the geographical groups and age classes, in the decision process of a policymaker.

Hence, in the first scenario in order to avoid the risk of spreading the contagion within a very fragile and concentrated community, strong social distancing measures with respect external individuals should be put in place. Such measures, if in the form of a strict lockdown applied regardless the age class membership, might have severe economic consequences and disruptive effects on production processes. Our approach thus sheds light on how target policy actions on specific age classes (namely, young and elderly people) can contain the spreading of contagion and keep a sufficient level of workforce at the same time.",

An analogous effect can be observed by varying the lockdown time: anticipating the lockdown ameliorates the peak by decreasing its height, but shifts it to later time and retards the end of the epidemic.

This is to be expected every time extreme measures of social distancing are applied in the very early, exponentially growing, stages. In fact, let us consider two countries A and B, having the same number of inhabitants, the same contact matrix, and the same number of infected people. If A and B decide to put a lockdown of strength \u03b1 at time t A and t B , respectively, at time t any quantity y would have grown as y A (t) \u223c y 0 e R0t A e \u03b1R0(t\u2212t A ) and as y B (t) \u223c y 0 e R0t B e \u03b1R0(t\u2212tB) . If there exists a t such that y A (t) = y B (t ), the epidemics in A and in B will proceed in parallel (even in the non-linear phase) with a delay t \u2212 t. Therefore, if the epidemic dynamics of A and B are still well approximated by exponentials at times < max{t, t }, then t \u2212 t \u221d \u2212(t A \u2212 t B ), i.e, the country that has started the lockdown before will experience the same epidemic of the other country, just delayed in time.

On the other hand, for \u03b1 < \u03b1 crit the epidemics decreases; nevertheless, since this happens before a sufficient number of recovered individuals has built up herd-immunization, the height of the peaks after the lockdown lifting are almost unchanged if compared with the no lockdown scenario. Again, a \"too good\" intervention risks to postpone the problem without attenuating it. Notice that, if one applies lockdowns with \u03b1 < \u03b1 crit , it could be necessary to switch back and forth to lockdown to avoid the peak go beyond the capacity of a national healthcare system (see Fig. 9 ).",
