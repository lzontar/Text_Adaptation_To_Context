However, both 49 patients had a good response to the infection, which could provide some support to the recommendations made concerning COVID-19 and asthma that encourage the 51 continuation of maintenance therapies in asthmatic patients. For example, the recent 52 GINA report 2020 recommends advising patients with asthma to continue taking their 53 prescribed asthma medications 4 . 54 In our opinion, the treatment with benralizumab and the rest of the maintenance asthma 55 medications may have had a protective effect on our patients. A recent consensus paper 56 highlights the importance of maintaining asthma control in the context of this 57 pandemic 5 . The same publication states that there is no evidence of an impaired immune 58 response to this infection in asthma patients on treatment with monoclonal antibodies 5 . 59 On the other hand, a positive effect of inhaled corticosteroids in the defense and against 60 SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be ruled out. Possible mechanisms have already been 61 listed, such as the in-vitro inhibition of the replication of SARS-CoV-2 by inhaled 62 ciclesonide 6 and budesonide 7 , and the reduction of expression of ACE2 receptor in 63 atopic subjects utilized by protein S of the virus 8 . Besides, some reports describe the 64 important role of the macrophage infiltration in the deterioration of COVID-19 65 patients 9 . Inhaled corticosteroids such as budesonide suppress the synthesis of the 66 granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). 8 The potential 67 advantages of inhaled corticosteroids do not apply to systemic corticosteroids; data 68 show potential harm with increased time for viral clearance and no evidence of clinical 69 benefit 11 . 70 Recent data show that an important proportion of COVID-19 patients develop 71 eosinopenia during the infection, and it has been suggested that an increase in 72 eosinophils might indicate a clinical improvement in this disease 12 . As benralizumab 73 has a cytotoxic effect on eosinophils NK cells-mediated, it seems unlikely that an 74 increase in eosinophils could have taken place in our patients, although we do not have may not be necessary for a successful COVID-19 recovery. 77 To our knowledge, this is the first report of patients with severe asthma and biologic 78 treatment that have been affected by COVID-19. It would be necessary to have a higher 79 number of cases and a deeper understanding of this viral infection to the potential 80 relevance of asthma and its treatment with corticosteroids and biologics in the evolution 81 of the infection. Despite these limitations, we believe that our data encourage the 82 continuation of maintenance therapy and biologic treatment of asthmatic patients in the 83 context of this pandemic.
