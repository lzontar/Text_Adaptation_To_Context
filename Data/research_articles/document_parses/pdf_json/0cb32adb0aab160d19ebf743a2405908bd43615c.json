Applying a 21-day cut-off for the Abbexa device meets the minimum (98%) sensitivity and specificity thresholds set by the UK Medicine & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The Abbexa device captures antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, as opposed to Hangzhou that targets only the nucleocapsid protein. We therefore propose that spike glycoprotein antibodies be considered as part of the standard diagnostic approach towards SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiling to improve clinical sensitivity and potentially specificity, pending follow-up studies to confirm this approach.",

Currently, the most widely employed tool for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 is identification of present infection with SARS-CoV-2 by detection of virus-specific RNA from nasopharyngeal swab specimens using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR, i.e. PCR). 1 This requires specialist equipment, staff and reagents, which creates a significant delay between testing and diagnosis. Furthermore, PCR cannot be used to determine past exposure or immunity, whereas tests that detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be used to identify both present infection and past exposure, depending on detection of the immunoglobulin (Ig) classes IgM, IgG, or both. 2 Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices, also referred to as rapid diagnostic test (RDT) devices, offer the prospect of rapid point-of-care testing (POCT), which involves a capillary blood draw by fingerstick and immediate application of that blood to an LFIA device. POCT with LFIA devices might be particularly advantageous in the outpatient, GP and community settings, as it can be performed near the bedside. However, the accuracy and robustness of sample collection methods must be evaluated before LFIA devices can be adopted for routine clinical use. 3 Current UK national regulations dictate further evaluation of LFIA devices is necessary before they can be used widely. 4 We sought to evaluate two LFIA devices to start with by comparing their performance against a well characterised residual seraset at the following timeline brackets: day 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, and >28 from onset of symptoms. We chose two LFIA devices ( Figure 1 Common targets detected by these LFIA devices include antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The S glycoprotein is comprised of two subunits; S1 mediates viral attachment and entry through the host cell ACE2 receptor and S2 the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. 7 The N protein is the SARS-CoV-2 structural protein that binds to the viral genomic RNA. 8 The Abbexa device is designed to detect antibodies against both S and N, 6 whilst the Hangzhou device is designed to detect antibodies against N only. 9 We sought to compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of each device against PCR.",

There are several such devices emerging on the market, and as with any diagnostic technology, their performance needs to be evaluated against manufacturers' claims before they can be adopted for widespread, routine clinical use. High clinical and analytical specificity and sensitivity are required for antibody testing if the results are to be used for clinical management decisions such as de-isolating individuals from quarantine. 11 Our seraset comparison was framed along the lines of the Royal College of Pathologists (RCPath) guidance on verification of SARS-CoV-2 serology assays. 12 Overall, the data presented in this study support the use of IgG as a biomarker of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected at least 21 days from onset of COVID-19 symptoms where the assay performance is considered acceptable. The In our study, the Abbexa device significantly outperformed the Hangzhou device. This is of interest because there is currently a major point of debate in health circles as to the clinical and public health relevance of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in terms of performance characteristics evidencing exposure, 10 infection, or immunity and protection from severe disease. The single major difference in the technical configuration between the two devices is the additional capacity of the Abbexa LFIA device to detect antibodies against the S glycoprotein. There is a further need to understand the functional elements of the spike glycoprotein subunits, S1 and S2. There are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) currently available, such as the COVID-19 IgG Confirmation assay (Dia.Pro Diagnostic Bioprobes, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy), which could be evaluated to provide further insight into the frequency and magnitude of specific antibody responses against S1 and S2 and their discriminatory diagnostic and clinical value. There may be value in combining spike and nucleocapsid antigen targets to ascertain antibody responses in individuals following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, rather than attempting to compare antibody response against one protein moiety in contrast to the other.",

It is therefore not possible to draw any conclusions regarding the longevity of IgG past this time. Further analysis of convalescent sera collected across a greater timeline is therefore required to draw more general conclusions and to improve the clinical utility of these tests.",

Consideration should be given to include the S glycoprotein, cognisant of S1 and S2 subunit inclusion, as a standard target in LFIA devices to ascertain the clinical sensitivity and specificity of immune response to SARS-CoV-2.",

Detection of IgM by either of these two LFIA devices was not sufficiently sensitive to replace PCR as the gold standard for diagnosing active infection. However, since both IgM and IgG become detectable at the same time,13 the absence of both could rule out active infection.It was quite evident in our study that the Abbexa device outperformed the Hangzhou device consistently across all timeline brackets for the various statistical parameters, i.e. sensitivity, specificity, NPV, for both IgG and IgM, reaching the MHRA standards that the manufacturer claims as achieved by day 21. The IgG positivity reaching close to 85% by day 14 in the Abbexa device is also quite reassuring. Furthermore, specificity was maintained throughout the convalescent time period in the Abbexa device, at levels mandated by MHRA (98%), 10 which was also similar for the Hangzhou device. The comparatively poor NPV of the Hangzhou device raises questions about its utility in informing clinical and public health practice.",

The sensitivity of the Abbexa device increased incrementally (70\u00b799% to 100%), whilst the Hangzhou device plateaued by 14 days following symptom onset (57\u00b725% to 68\u00b718%). As early as day 21, the sensitivity of the Abbexa device for IgG was very close to the manufacturer's reported figures: 97\u00b787% against 98\u00b76%, and 100% by day 28. A maximum sensitivity of 68\u00b718% was calculated against the manufacturer's claimed 99\u00b79% for the Hangzhou device at day 28. Neither device met the manufacturer's claim for IgM sensitivity. In light of the significant improvement in sensitivity of the Abbexa device in detecting IgG against SARS-CoV-2 between days 14 and 21 post symptom onset, day 21 was chosen as the cut-off for ascertaining test performance for IgG, below which a negative result could not be relied upon.Limited cross-reactivity was identified with only a single specimen collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic testing positive for IgM, resulting in an IgM specificity of 93\u00b775% for both devices, compared to the 98% specificity reported by each manufacturer. The IgG specificity was 100% for both devices. The NPV performance in Abbexa was superior to Hangzhou across all timeline brackets, with Abbexa reaching an NPV of 0\u00b794 by day 21 and beyond for IgG, versus 0\u00b750 for Hangzhou by the same timeline bracket.",
