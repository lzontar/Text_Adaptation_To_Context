In a large survey conducted over 2 years and involving 107 subjects, it was noted that the risk of having a first episode of tachyarrhythmia was 3.9%, which was thought to be similar to the background rate.

Adenosine, an endogenous nucleoside, is ultrashort-acting, with a plasma half-life of \u03fd2 seconds.

There is increasing experience of flecainide use in the treatment of arrhythmias, especially in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
