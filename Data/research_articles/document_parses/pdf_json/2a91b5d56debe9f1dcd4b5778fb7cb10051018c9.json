An. quadrimaculatus APN in 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.2, was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by aminecoupling method (Biacore AB). The flow buffer HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20 (v/v), pH 7.4) (Biacore AB) was used at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcl/min. Multiple concentrations(4, 8, 16, and 32 \u03bcM) of Cry11Ba was injected across the flow cell containing the APN and one blank flow cell containing ethanolamine as a blocking agent. Surfaces were regenerated with 2 pulses of 10 \u03bcl of 10 mM NaOH, pH 11, at 100 \u03bcl/min or until the signal return to baseline. Signal responses from the blank flow cells were subtracted from all response curves and data were globally fitted using BIAevaluation Ver. 3.1 (Biacore AB). The curves were fitted to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model (A+B \u2194 AB) to obtain apparent rate constants.N-terminal sequencing and sequence similarity searchFor N-terminal sequencing, proteins separated in SDS-PAGE were transferred onto PVDF membrane (Roche) by electro-transfer (Mini-PROTEAN\u2122 II, Bio Rad) according to the manufacturer. The membrane was stained briefly with Coomassie Blue R-250 and destained in 50% methanol. Bands representing 100-kDa proteins were excised and sequencing was performed on an automated sequencer (Model 477A, Applied Biosystems) at USDA Forest Service Laboratory, Delaware, OH. Data mining was performed on the N-terminal sequence using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), an on-line tool, at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website. The search parameter was limited to arthropods.
