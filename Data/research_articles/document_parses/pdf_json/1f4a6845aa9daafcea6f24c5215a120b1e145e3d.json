One of them with positive IgG and IgM serology and the other with negative IgG and IgM. They were two nurses from the Emergency Department without any personal record. They had no symptoms on the day of sampling. The healthcare worker with a positive IgG and IgM pattern reported having had diarrhea, general discomfort, and contact with the CoVID-19 case outside the workplace in the previous fourteen days, so it was probably a paucisymptomatic case with persistent naso CRP positive oropharyngeal. So, only one healthcare worker (0.2%) was a true asymptomatic carrier.Serology resultsNine health workers with positive IgG were detected (1.8%), one of them with a positive PCR. Seven of them (1.4%) had IgG positive with negative IgM and PCR. They included two doctors, a nurse, three nursing assistants, and a warden. By areas, two belonged to the ER, one to Intensive Care, two to the CoVID-19 plant and the other two to the non-CoVID-19 plant. None of them reported a background of interest. On the day of the extraction, only one of them reported rhinorrhea as an isolated symptom. In the previous two weeks, one of them reported having presented cough and runny nose, another diarrhea, another headache and two general malaise. In none of these cases was contact with a CoVID-19 case outside the workplace. Two other workers had positive IgG and IgM. As already mentioned, one of these workers with positive IgG and IgM serology had a positive SARS-Cov-2 PCR in the nasooropharynx. The other worker was an intensive care nursing assistant with negative and had no history of interest or symptoms on the day of the extraction or in the previous fourteen days. Nor did it refer to contact with CoVID-19 cases outside the workplace. Two more workers (0.4%) presented positive IgM with negative IgG and negative PCR. It was a CoVID-19 floor doctor and a non-CoVID-19 floor nurse, with no relevant history. On the day of extraction, one of them reported headache and in the previous two weeks the other worker reported having presented a cough. After 14 days of sampling, both remained asymptomatic.DiscussionIn this cut-off study in healthcare workers with high occupational exposure, we have detected a percentage of asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 of 0.4%. Actually, one of the two health workers detected as asymptomatic carriers presented a suggestive clinical picture of CoVID-19 in the two previous weeks, which together with the presence of positive IgG and IgM suggests that it was a CoVID-19 case with little clinical expression. Thus, true asymptomatic carriers would decrease to 0.2%, with a single case among 498 workers investigated. The percentage of asymptomatic individuals with positive IgG was 1.8%, excluding the worker who presented positive PCR, this percentage would decrease to 1.6%, without any symptoms suggestive of CoVID-19 being identified in the fourteen days prior to sampling.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Cross-sectional study carried out between April 15 and 24, 2020 among health workers at the Costa del Sol Hospital in Marbella, in the Autonomous Community of Andalusia (Spain).
