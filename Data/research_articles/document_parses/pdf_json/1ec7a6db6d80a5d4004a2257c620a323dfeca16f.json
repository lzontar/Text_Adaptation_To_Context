A series of fundamental questions have been raised about AI-driven health interventions, and whether the tools, methods, and protections traditionally used to make ethical and evidence-based decisions about new technologies can be applied to AI. Deployment of AI has already begun for a broad range of health issues common to LMICs, with interventions focused primarily on communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and malaria. Types of AI vary, but most use some form of machine learning or signal processing. Several types of machine learning methods are frequently used together, as is machine learning with other approaches, most often signal processing. AI-driven health interventions fit into four categories relevant to global health researchers: (1) diagnosis, (2) patient morbidity or mortality risk assessment, (3) disease outbreak prediction and surveillance, and (4) health policy and planning. However, much of the AI-driven intervention research in global health does not describe ethical, regulatory, or practical considerations required for widespread use or deployment at scale. Despite the field remaining nascent, AI-driven health interventions could lead to improved health outcomes in LMICs. Although some challenges of developing and deploying these interventions might not be unique to these settings, the global health community will need to work quickly to establish guidelines for development, testing, and use, and develop a user-driven research agenda to facilitate equitable and ethical use.",

            "text": "AI is changing how health services are delivered in many high-income settings, particularly in specialty care (eg, radiology and pathology). [1] [2] [3] This development has been facilitated by the growing availability of large datasets and novel analytical methods that rely on such datasets. Concurrent advances in information technology (IT) infrastructure and mobile computing power have raised hopes that AI might also provide opportunities to address health challenges in LMICs. 4 These challenges, including acute health workforce shortages and weak public health surveillance systems, undermine global progress towards achieving the health-related sustainable development goals (SDGs). 5, 6 Although not unique to such countries, these challenges are particularly relevant given their contribution to morbidity and mortality. 7, 8 AI-driven health technologies could be used to address many of these and other system-related challenges. 4 For example, in some settings, AI-driven interventions have supplemented clinical decision making towards reducing the workload of health workers. 9 New developments in AI have also helped to identify disease outbreaks earlier than traditional approaches, thereby supporting more timely programme planning and policy making. 10 Although these interventions provide promise, there remain several ethical, regulatory, and practical issues that require guidance before scale-up or widespread deployment in low and middle-income settings. 4 The global health community, including several large donor agencies, has increasingly recognised the urgency of addressing these issues towards ensuring that populations in low and middle-income settings benefit from developments in digital health and AI. 11 Several global meetings have taken place since 2015. [12] [13] [14] For example, in May, 2018, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on digital technologies for universal health coverage. 15 In 2019, the United Nations Secretary General's High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation recommended that \"by 2030, every adult should have affordable access to digital networks, as well as digitallyenabled financial and health services, as a means to make a substantial contribution to achieving the SDGs\". 16 ",

The titles and abstracts of identified articles were initially reviewed by a study reviewer to assess whether the study was done in a low-income or middle-income country, according to the World Bank Atlas country classification method, and focused on health or health system challenges that could be addressed with artificial intelligence (AI) interventions. We synthesised key themes and trends, using a previously described classification for AI-driven health interventions (ie, expert systems, machine learning, natural language processing, automated planning and scheduling, and image and signal processing) and broad categories of health interventions (ie, diagnosis, risk assessment, disease outbreak prediction and surveillance, and health policy and planning). We excluded studies done in LMICs where AI might have been used to develop a drug or diagnostic, but was not a central component of the final health tool being studied.",

The automation or support of diagnosis for communicable and non-communicable diseases emerged from studies as one of the main uses of AI. Signal processing methods are often used together with machine learning to automate the diagnosis of communicable diseases. Signal processing interventions focused specifically on the use of radiological data for tuberculosis 18, 23 and drug-resistant tuberculosis, 19 ultrasound data for pneumonia, 24 micro scopy data for malaria, [25] [26] [27] and other biological sources of data for tuberculosis. [28] [29] [30] Most diagnostic interventions using AI in LMICs reported either high sensitivity, specificity, or high accuracy (>85% for all), or non-inferiority to comparator diagnostic tools. Machine learning aids clinicians in diagnosing tuberculosis, 31 and expert systems are used for diagnosing tuberculosis 32 and malaria. 27 Studies mostly reported high diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy; however, at least one study reported low accuracy when attempting to identify asymptomatic cases of malaria. 27 AI-driven interventions also focused on the diagnosis of non-communicable diseases in LMICs, primarily using signal processing methods for disease detection, including cervical cancer and pre-cervical cancer using microscopy, [33] [34] [35] [36] or data from photos of the cervix called cervigrams. 37 The accuracy has been reported to be greater than 90%. One study aimed to evaluate a lowcost, point-of-care oral cancer screening tool using cloudbased signal processing and reported high sensitivity and specificity relative to that of an onsite specialist. 38 Morbidity and mortality risk assessment is another area for which AI driven interventions have been assessed in the global health context. These interventions are based largely on machine learning classification tools and typically compare multiple machine learning approaches with the aim of identifying the optimal approach to characterise risk. This approach has also been used at health facilities to predict disease severity in patients with dengue fever 20 and malaria, 39 and children with acute infections. 40 Researchers have used this approach to quantify the risk of tuberculosis treatment failure 41 and assess the risk of cognitive sequelae after malaria infection in children. 42 See Online for appendix",

One such study used data from a health facility in Brazil and an agent-based simulation model to compare programme options aimed at increasing the overall efficiency of the health workforce. 58 In another study, researchers used several government datasets-including health system, environmental, and financial data-together with machine learning (ie, artificial neural networks) to optimise the allocation of health system resources by geography based on an array of prevalent health challenges. 59 Expert planning methods and household survey data to optimise community health-worker visit schedules were reported in the literature; however, no results have yet been published. 60 Additionally, AI methods aimed at informing programme planning efforts within facilities have been evaluated in low and middle-income settings. Some examples include forecasting the number of outpatient visits at an urban hospital 61 and the length of health -worker retention, 22 using machine learning methods and large administrative datasets from health facilities. In another example, researchers used expert systems and administrative data to design a system for measuring the performance of hospital managers. 62 Researchers are also using machine learning and data mining methods to improve road safety in LMICs.

Especially in disease diagnosis, where AIpowered interventions could be used in countries with insufficient numbers of health providers, and in risk assessment, where tools based largely on machine learning could help to supplement clinical knowledge. 9 Although the research identified in this Review indicates that AI-driven health interventions can help to address several existing and emerging health challenges, many issues are not sufficiently described in these studies and warrant further exploration. These issues relate to the development of AI-driven health interventions; how efficacy and effectiveness are assessed and reported; planning for deployment at scale; and the ethical, regulatory, and economic standards and guidelines that will help to protect the interests of communities in LMICs. Although these issues have been described elsewhere, 4,11,65-67 they have not been systematically or explicitly addressed in research published to date.

Although processes to enable benchmarking and assessment have begun, including a collaboration between WHO and the UN International Telecommunications Union (ITU), 12,69 this type of testing will require adequate and representative datasets from observational and surveillance studies, electronic medical records, and social media platforms. Open access to diverse datasets representing different populations is particularly important, considering that most AI-driven health interventions from the research literature we identified are based on machine learning. Enabling access across borders will require new types of data sharing protocols and standards on inter-operability and data labelling. This global movement could be facilitated by an international collaboration so that data are rapidly and equitably available for the development and testing of AI-driven health interventions. Such collaborations are already being developed in the UK by initiatives such as the Health Data Research Alliance 70 and the Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe. 71 Reporting and methodological standards are also required for AI health interventions in LMICs, particularly those used for diagnostic tools. Although the epidemiological and statistical methods used in studies that we identified seem largely appropriate for the research questions addressed, results were not reported consistently. For example, some studies assessing diagnostic tools provide estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy-ie, the probability of an individual being correctly identified by a diagnostic test, which is mathematically equivalent to a weighted average of the sensitivity and specificity of the test. However, other studies provided only a subset of these measurements. The use of comparators was also inconsistently reported. The Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 72 provide guidelines for diagnostic assessments and could be a starting place for standardising of research in AI diagnostics.",

Furthermore, investments in AI and health were forecasted to have reached US$1\u20227 billion in 2018, 77 and are increasingly dominated by private equity firms 78 and driven by so-called big tech companies such as Google and Baidu ventures. 79 Given that many interventions are developed in the private sector for commercial use, some AI developers might not place a high priority on publishing the results in academic literature. 80 AI is already being developed to address health issues in LMICs.

The breadth and promising results of these interventions emphasise the urgency for the global community to act and create guidance to facilitate deployment of effective interventions.
