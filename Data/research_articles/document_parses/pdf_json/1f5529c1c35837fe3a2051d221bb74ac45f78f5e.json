Our models combine two groups of diffusion factors relevant for complex contagions: network structure and social constraints. In particular, we study the effect of perceptive limitations caused by information overexposure. This effect was not yet measured in the classical models of community-aware meme spreading. Limiting our study to hashtags acting as specific, concise memes, we propose different ways of reflecting information overexposure: by limited hashtag usage or global/local increase of hashtag generation probability. Based on simulations of meme spreading, we provide quantitative comparison of our models with three other models known from literature, and additionally, with the ground truth, constructed from hashtag popularity data retrieved from Twitter.

In particular, community structures can trap information flows and transform simple epidemic spreading to complex contagion, affected additionally by social mechanisms of homophily, reinforcement or overexposure. Inter-community concentration of early meme adopters is one of the most important features in predicting virality [17, 18] . Surprisingly, as presented in [14] , the local structural properties of communities are less important than mesoscopic community view. In the context of hashtag propagation over Twitter network, it was shown that spreading of less popular hashstags should be described as complex contagion, subject to homophily and social reinforcement, while virals propagate similar to diseases [17] . Apart from communities, the structure of subgraphs induced by early adopters is also crucial in modeling future meme dynamics. In [3] , the authors perform extensive feature engineering for hashtag virality prediction and build classification model, which uses subgraph conductance as one of the most discriminative features. More recently, in [6] , the authors analyze structural properties of meme adoption graphs (MAGs) and formulate MAG-based, generic framework for spreading models comparison.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 93, "end": 96, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 97, "end": 99, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 100, "end": 103, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 104, "end": 107, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 437, "end": 441, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 442, "end": 445, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 478, "end": 482, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 829, "end": 833, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 966, "end": 969, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1183, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Related Works"}, {"text": "In our work we were inspired by structural models taking into account social reinforcement and homophily [17, 18] , but we decided to additionally include negative feedback loop related to overused memes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 105, "end": 109, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 110, "end": 113, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Related Works"}, {"text": "We demonstrated that hashtag spreading is a complex process, which cannot be accurately modeled based on the network structure only.
