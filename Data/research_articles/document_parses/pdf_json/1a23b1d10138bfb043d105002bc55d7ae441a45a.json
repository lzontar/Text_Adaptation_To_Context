This perspective is applied to the working of humanitarian organizations with an overview of options for using this logic to optimize the full potential that is inherent to the mandate of these institutions. It is shown how the proposed paradigm shift can be started, expanded and maintained, from individuals to institutions and vice versa. The outline of Compassion for Change (C4C) proposes a concrete way for using the paradigm-shift that this book is based up to transform the internal culture of humanitarian and development organizations in order to reanimate and expand their external influence.",

Every person we meet is a messenger; who carries unknowingly something that may be for us, a piece of advice, a new perspective, a warning; or they may be an intermediary who represents a bridge to someone else. Some people come and leave our path, others walk with us a couple of steps, and yet others come to stay. Each of us fills this same triple role, of messenger, connector, and companion, in the relationships with others. Everything is complementary and connected. Sometimes the events that jot our lifeline seem like random occurrences; and yet, looking back a line emerges that brings order into apparent chaos.",

The biggest impact derives from those who made me not only see but feel what 'being kind' means. Over the extent of my career, I have been very lucky with the supervisors I worked for. My first supervisor was kind, warm-hearted, and passionate about everything; working, living, and loving from the bottom of his heart. He was the type of person who every aspiring humanitarian should have as a champion and mentor, at least for the bumpy stretch at the beginning. Working with him was an essential start-up capital, allowing me to develop a basic minimum of self-confidence, which as it turned out would be direly needed. The subsequent supervisors were more challenging, due to personalities and approaches that were very different from my own. Nevertheless, each of these 'guides' taught me something; either by using a type of management to learn from or by illustrating the opposite, hereby sensitizing me to the consequences first-hand; showing me what I did not want to become.",

I will not go here into a diatribe for or against one dietary orientation or another, nor will I pretend that it is easy to renounce on a type of food whose taste and texture you have grown up with. For many years I have been on and off; shifting back and forth between vegan, vegetarian, and omnivore; finding myself, even after years without meat, give in to the craving for chicken or fish. Until the moment when I decided to make a choice between taste buds and values. The need for internal coherence had moved higher up the scale than my innate desire for flavour, habit, and comfort. Combined with the realization of how inefficient it is to take the lives of other beings to make our own tastier, that did the trick. Unfortunately, I still have not reached the stage where the sight of seafood does not leave me with nostalgia; but withstanding appetite is manageable. Seeing the ever-growing range of vegan alternatives makes it easy. 1 On the aspirational level, the way in which I approached the need for meaning has taken various shapes over the years. Though it is an ongoing expedition, four shifts can be singled out so far. I started with the ardent desire to be an actor. Not because of the fame and fortune that supposedly goes with it, but with the (just as delirious) intention of showing on stage how the world could be; making spectators rethink the way they experienced their daily routine. Realizing that I was not ready to reside in a glasshouse of pretended reality, doing what others instructed me to do for the rest of my career, I moved on to become a lawyer. Thinking that this would put me in a position to conceive regulations aimed at helping those who cannot help themselves, by at least putting the law on their side. After a couple of years, understanding that the law is only as powerful as the will of those who implement it, I left the sphere of theory, and Europe.

I felt that despite the power that arose from its multilateral nature, the beauty that came from its multi-ethnicity, and the influence that derives from its mission, the institution was bound to underperform. Its magic is conditioned by the willingness of those who work within. (This dependency on the mind and mood of their staff, which may represent a liability at present, is the biggest asset that the organization has in the pursuit of its mandate, which is part of my motivation for this book.) Finally, and this is for the time being the last stage of transition, I sought to institutionalize POZE. Contemplating possible constellations, from NGO to foundation it took me a while until I realized the paradox. That such a set-up would directly contradict the paradigm shift that it was meant to promote. Institutionalizing an idea, a vision, exposes it to the inherent danger of institutions-human nature. As you may have noticed from the previous pages the most distinctive feature of the proposed logic is the holistic inclusivity that underpins it. Creating (yet another) non-governmental entity to promote and manage this philosophy, means exposing it consciously to the bulit-in risks of any entity. All too often I had seen organizations that were supposed to be a means to an end, a tool to accomplish a mission, become an end unto themselves. Driven by an ever vaster, sophisticated machinery to feed themselves. And yet here I was, about to step into the same trap. Then I stopped.",

Elements of reflection and rethinking are proposed, including areas for internal change to nurture the synchronization of institutional ambitions and individual staff attitude. Everything begins inside. In the same way in which aspirations are the determining factor of an individual's existence, individuals are the driving force of institutions, and of society. Change in the visible sphere, be it the human body, or an institutional set-up, an organization, a school, a company, a village, or a country begins at the centre of that entity. Changing society, including the institutions that operate in it, depends on people; directly and indirectly. Fundamentally it is people who drive and nurture change, and who cultivate the status quo. People who transform themselves become part of a transformational dynamic in the institution that they are part of. Due to the gradually evolving collection of individuals the entity gradually evolves, changing in line with those people once a tipping point is passed and a critical mass of people reached (Gladwell 2000) . Through their attitude and behaviour each person contributes to the emergence of a new collective culture.

Going down to the causes means to look at individual behaviour; and further down, to the thoughts, emotions and aspirations that underpin this physical manifestation of an attitude in the form of a re-action. Not in a one size fits all approach, but with a holistic logic, that combines the big picture perspective of eagles in the sky with the vision of ants on the floor. [Interestingly whatever appears we dislike in others, offers an entry-point to not just look closer to understand them better; their habits can also serve to understand ourselves better by zooming in on the dark spots that we would rather overlook; which maybe one reason why so many staff issues remain unearthed.]. The trick is to simultaneously pursue modifications at microand meso-level.

Yet while initiatives, projects, and departments with the innovation-label abound, the institutions that succeeded to create an innovation culture are rare. As seen earlier, cultures grow organically, and infusing the elements that are needed to influence that growth in the desired direction is challenging. This is particularly true when it comes to innovation, because of the inherent paradox that is involved. Innovative cultures are yet another illustration of the scale of apparent opposites which complement each other. Getting staff to think and act beyond boxes, while bringing back valuable results from that no man's land of creativity, involves failure. Creativity is thus largely related to the balance of commitment, confidence, candour, and comfort. People must be committed to give their best (aspiration), feel emotionally safe, thus confident to dare (heart), accept and acquire honest feedback (mind); and they must evolve in an atmosphere that makes cooperation comfortable, natural (body). Put on the scale of complementarity, the four pairs appear: Commitment thrives on competence; Tolerance for failure requires intolerance for incompetence; Experimentation requires discipline; Comfort with collaboration is the counter-piece of individual accountability (Pisano 2019) .

Just a few words from the preamble suffice to set the tone: 'We, the peoples of this world, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, and for these aims to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest, and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, [\u2026] '. 3 What better foundation could an institution have than the aspiration to be an entity that moves the world for better? And yet, as large as its potential, are the doubts and critics that loom large, hovering like a dark cloud over the UN's present and future. Many people inside the organization consider the prevailing insufficiencies as a result of bureaucracy, politics, institutional culture, and lack of funding; whereas external observers alternatively see the organization as a black box whose content and action are unclear, or as a massive operation that serves primarily those who are supposed to serve others. 4 No matter how inspiring an organization's mandate and mission statement, advocacy material and website are, if its staff is not authentic it will not connect with, and consequently influence, the public.",

Intervening at the institutional level is therefore a pragmatic way to reach a large group of people in a certain sector in a coherent manner. To bring about change in the humanitarian sector thus starts with the individuals who work in it, by targeting them through their employer; while simultanously introducing administrative, structural and programmatic alterations in that institution.

The underpinning philosophies are diverse; ranging from religious beliefs such as the concept of Christian charity or the Islamic tradition of Zakat to ethical concepts of appropriate wartime conduct (Davey et al. 2013) . Probably the most well-known origin story of formalized humanitarian aid is that of Henri Dunant, a businessman and social activist, who upon seeing the coldblooded abandonment of wounded soldiers during the Battle of Solferino in 1859, cancelled his plans and began a relief response for these soldiers. His book 'Memory of Solferino' prompted the creation of the Red Cross in 1863; one of the first true international aid organizations. The four basic principles that govern humanitarian aid as we know it today were formally established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1991 (humanity, impartiality, and neutrality) and 2004 (independence).",

This period also saw a sudden and unprecedented growth of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), with over 200 organizations established in the four years immediately following the end of the war (Rysaback-Smith 2016). The French NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors without borders), which is seen by many as the archetype of compassionate humanitarian commitment, was founded in 1971, in response to the repercussions of the Biafra secession; it began with a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries; irrespective of race, religion, creed, or political affiliation.",

In the French aid community, this spirit of activism has for several decades infused the operating model of both small and large organizations; examples are the NGOs Medecins du Monde, M\u00e9decins sans frontiers, Action contre la faim and Solidarit\u00e9s. Over the past decade, partially due to the rapid expansion of the aid sector, which has become a line of business, a drastic shift has occurred (Konyndyk 2018) . 7 Growing in staff and budget, facing not only ever more needs on the ground but also an ever more demanding and critical donor audience, NGOs all over the world 'professionalized' their operations, introducing results-based management approaches and quantifiable progress indicators. Monitoring, measurement and reporting obligations came hand in hand with an ever-increasing need for visibility; to be seen to have done has become a central preoccupation since it influences significantly the ability to mobilize money.

As many 'old school' humanitarians retire or quit, a new generation is entering the stage, coming with a different mindset and working style. There is no right or wrong in this. Possibly it is an unavoidable result of changes in the global landscape with shifting needs, expanding tools including new technologies, new players, and revolving agendas. The question is not to criticize, prevent, or even delay this transformation but to be conscious of its impact, internally and outside.

Looking at the conundrum of institutional reforms may feel like a plate of spaghetti, with no way to identify a loose noodle end to start twirling.

Every meso-system that we belong to, from workplace to family, comes with a number of stakeholders who have expectations of us. These expectations pertain to our role/s in that context and the task-sets that derive from them (Heise et al. 2015) . These groupings may be formal or informal, reasonable or not. Roles can serve as a useful grid, helping us relate to others in the system. However, when we invest everything that we are into one single role it becomes more than a role; gradually morphing into our identity. This is especially true for individuals whose job evolves on a 24h on-call basis; as it is the case for many social workers and staff on the ground in non-profit organizations, especially in humanitarian scenarios; but also, for managers whose responsibilities make them (feel) indispensable. Eventually the role eats up the person, taking along the personality that s/he had initially aspired to. If awareness of this swing from reality to role-play comes too late an alternative path seems no longer accessible. Like an actor who always played the youthful hero finds himself out of demand when wrinkles, sagging muscles, and grey hair no longer permit the illusion of youth and sex appeal. When our present-day experience stands not only in sharp contrast to our aspirations, but when our horizon has shrunk so much that we cannot envision a different play or a new role for the future; then disillusionment turns to despair, which ultimately becomes cynicism.

The interplay of mind and matter, of body and heart, of inside and outside influences how individuals feel, and by consequence express themselves, which in turn influences how they experience their environment, and are experienced by those around them. In addition to the aspects looked at above, three individual behaviours are worth mentioning here as particularly corrosive in the context of non-profit cultures: omnipotence, numbness, and justified neglect (Wedell-Wedellsborg 2019). Omnipotence is when a person believes the rules of decent behaviour do not apply to them. A direct correlation has been discovered between the perception that people have of their own power and leniency towards their own rule breaking. Both increase simultaneously. Research shows that individuals who hold power are more likely to show so-called alpha-male behaviour, including assertiveness, aggression and domination, which come with feelings of impatience and anger. 12 Conversely, people with alpha-male behaviour (which occurs in males and females alike) tend to be or remain in positions of power, which is helped by the fact that their conscious rule breaking often equips them in the eyes of observes with an aura of power, which further strengthens their position (van Kleef et al. 2011) .",

Alpha-male behaviour can be triggered intentionally; either artificially with the stimulation of certain brain circuits; or by applying the age-old piece of wisdom we encountered earlier: 'fake it til you make it'. When the thus induced assertive behaviour results in a win, the so-called 'winner effect' enforces the emulated behaviour; and with each repetition the involved synaptic connections in the brain get more permanent. As seen in Chapter 2, the brain influences behaviour, and behaviour influences the brain. Cultural numbness occurs when staff witness unethical behaviour and go along with it. Gradually, perceptions related to this type of deviance morph from being acknowledged and frowned upon as an exception to being condoned, to being accepted as normal for oneself and others. Once one window is broken, other broken windows become tolerable turn into an unwritten new. Wind blows where air gets in. The third element is justified neglect which flourishes when people do not speak up about ethical cracks, due to fear of the uncomfortable consequences that may result from it. Consciously drawing the lines that one is not willing to cross, especially when it is done in public, makes it easier to stay behind them. Such 'Contracting' with oneself and/or as a team is a straightforward way to proactively remediate (at least) these three behaviour patterns. The alternative is walking the way of least resistance in the form of chosen blindness.",

It is both a privilege and a joy to be part of an entity, be it small or gigantic, that places its resources, scope and effort behind the objective to make the world happier, less unequal, brighter. Despite or because of this high-reaching ambition, one may feel uneasy being part of such an entity. Queasiness ensues when the organization is not enacting the values that it stands for; and if by being part of that organization one contributes, actively and passively, to a continuation of the status quo. Without doing anything 'wrong', eventually nothing feels right either. It is not a question of black or white judgements, rather a lingering discomfort that is nagging inside. The result of lived inauthenticity. Inspiring institutions depend on the synchronization of individual and institutional purpose, or at least a gradually progressing harmonization of those two dimensions.",

Agnes is a passionate Vegan whose main desire is to convince everyone to eliminate animal products from their diet; she works for a company that promotes fair trade milk and meat consumption. Despite her attractive salary, Agnes' best way of action is to exit. Too big is the misalignment between her vision and the one of her employer. B. Staff at all levels follow a soulless routine, driven primarily by career interests. Benedict cares personally about his employers' mission, and although he gives his best in his area of specialization the behaviour of his colleagues weighs on his mood and motivation. He has three options-keep on doing what he does, satisfied by his personal performance, career moves, and entitlements; or quit; or he can proactively seek to influence those in his immediate vicinity; gradually expanding his influence on his colleagues he may eventually succeed to impact the institutional atmosphere. C. Staff at all levels seem to be passionately involved in the institutional cause; but something is missing. Carsten has been working with his current organization for many years, and although he cares deeply about its mission, and has also experienced the positive outcome of their work in the field, he feels empty inside. He performs his job, with the creepy sentiment that it is inefficient; questioning himself ever more often regarding the actual impact of the machine that he is part of. He also has three options-go on, alternatively chewing on his thoughts and anaesthetizing them with excessive sport, alcohol, food, parties, etc., or quit; or he can proactively bring his questions out in the public space of conversation in his workplace. Scenario C is the least straightforward of the three, let us look at it a bit closer. Should Carsten go for the third option? If he does his cause will benefit if he starts by dedicating time for himself first-to reconnect with his personal purpose. He must unearth what initially motivated him to join a non-profit organization. Unless he is grounded in his personal passion, and in synch with himself, he will not exert the influence he could have on those whom he will reach out to. Others will be persuaded to rethink their own experiences and expressions only if his expressions are driven by genuine passion. If he shows honesty with himself and the institution he is part of. His chances to find open ears and hearts are better than 50 percent; because if he feels that his organization does not practise what it preaches, others may feel the same way. Once they see one person who dares to speak up from a place of purpose-instead of merely bemoaning the status quo, likeminded supporters emerge out of nowhere.",

Even if he likes his present work, not believing in the added value of his daily activities and feeling powerless to transform the situation, may be enough to justify a clear exit.

Compassion fatigue and, eventually, burnout are common consequences in the social sector (Conrad and Kellar-Guenther 2006) . What once was a propeller turns to a heavy anchor that drags the individual down. If the current system leads to the rise of staff who feel disconnected and demotivated, then introspection and deriving from it, change is needed. Avoiding focus by hiding behind idealistic principles and aspirational mission statements that give the halo of 'doing good' is no option. That the humanitarian sector began with humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence does not protect today's aid workers from falling prey to their own human nature; including inertia, greed, and numbness. Reactivating the power to influence and inspire the wider public, requires honest insight; by each staff member, from the bottom up, and top down.

For years I had tried to wrap my heart around the concept of compassion. While in my mind the idea was clear, my heart remained quiet. I pursued the path of humanitarian action because I 'knew' that it was right. Seeking to overcome social injustice seemed to be the only pursuit that made, intellectually speaking, sense. Honesty with myself dissolved the zeal of succeeding at any price. I realized that my compassion was abstract not alive because it was not fuelled from inside. It had nothing to take roots in because I had no sympathy with myself. We are our own worst judges. Like everything else, the external ability to feel with others mirrors the internal capacity to feel with ourselves.",

Introspection can be either painful and hard, or exhilarating and fluid. While I did not face my own illusions, I could not face those of others; caught in the mirage of myself, my craving to belong, my quest for an identity, and the status that comes with it. How could I criticize what I was not only part of; but what had become an integral part my 'identity'? Honesty towards oneself fuels honesty with others; the same inside out spiral operates in each dimension; and in between them. Once the transition from one side of the spectrum of seemingly opposing experiences has begun, it accelerates. My present mindset neither disqualifies the past, nor does it put a mortgage on the future. * * * Take a moment and listen to the dialogue in your head. Is the voice that is your constant companion an optimistic, encouraging one? Is it calming your anxiety or fuelling it; is it nagging, or soothing? Is your thinking straightforward from A to B to C, or is an ongoing circle from A via B to A? Which part of your storyline is outdated? Who writes your dialogue? * * *",

There may be periods of stabilization, of transition, of affirmation; followed by radical jumps, curves, hills, or valleys. Evolution is neither fast and sudden, nor is it necessarily slow and gradual. The question is not to avoid extravagances but to rebalance the core components of our being as needed. If we gradually move towards the alignment of what we believe in, what we want, and what we do we move in the right direction. * * * Perhaps you were educated to believe that the evolution of our character, of our abilities, and of our personality is limited to childhood and that from a certain age the die is cast.

Changing an institutional culture is always challenging, and the trial grows exponentially with the size and complexity of the organization. Functioning like social contracts that specify the rules of membership, organizational cultures are unwritten yet sacred to many. When leaders set out to change the culture of an organization, they are in a sense breaking a (social) contract. It should not be surprising, then, that many people inside an organization-particularly those thriving under the existing rules-resist (Pisano 2019). 6. An interesting topic that shall not be explored further here is the role of B Corporates which proactively shape their approach to address the triple bottom line of serving people, planet, and profit. Certified B Corporations seek to balance purpose and profit. Once certified they are legally required to consider the impact of their decisions on their workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment. As of February 2020, there were 3243 companies from 71 countries registered in the online database of the B-Lab https://bcorporation.net/. 7. The above is a very simplified and incomplete take on the past and present of the humanitarian sector, which I do not ambition to summarize in its full extent. For a more detailed overview of challenges and perspectives faced by the humanitarian sector please refer to (Ferris 2008) and the website of the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International (HAP), which was established in 2003 as the humanitarian sector's first international self-regulatory body. For an overview of the history of the humanitarian sector please see (Rysaback-Smith 2016). 8. International humanitarian assistance is a significant source of support during crises, but while at just under $14 billion it is almost half of the $33 billion from development assistance, it is much smaller than other financial flows from richer to poorer countries such as the estimated $85 billion from remittances or the $41 billion from foreign direct investment. Harnessing even a tiny fraction of these other flows could have a significant impact on the funding available for crisis response (Weforum 2018). 9. Please note that even though the present pages focus on humanitarian action, the raised issues apply equally to development aid. 10. For an overview of policies check the UN Website for the prevention of internal exploitation and abuse https://www.un.org/preventingsexual-exploitation-and-abuse/content/policies. The UN-wide Code of conduct on this topic is accessible on the web via https:// www.un.org/management/sites/www.un.org.management/files/unsystem-model-code-conduct.pdf The CEB Task Force on Addressing Sexual Harassment within the Organizations of the UN System [CEB/2018/HLCM/14/Add.1] offers an overview of actions and results. 11. The broken windows theory is a criminological theory that states that visible signs of crime, antisocial behaviour, and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. The theory suggests that policing methods that target minor crimes such as vandalism, public drinking, and fare evasion help to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes (Kelling and Coles 1997) . The BWT is based on a general principle of a vicious circle, that can play in multiple contexts. Acknowledging there is no empirical support for its success in terms of policing (even Kelling worries about its application), it is used here without the racial connotations that are sometimes associated with its application to certain parts of the population as being more at risk, as it was pointed out by various scholars (Childress 2016) . 12. New research has located a brain circuit that, when activated in mice, transformed timid individuals into bold alpha-male mice that almost always prevailed in aggressive social encounters. The experience of winning appeared to leave an imprint on the mice, making them more assertive, even when their brains' were no longer artificially controlled. They were found to be more combative in a second scenario in which they competed to occupy the warm corner in a cage with an ice-cold floor (Zhou et al. 2017) . 13. Stress is useful when our heightened senses allow us to concentrate to solve a problem. However, it is detrimental when it is excessive (Sapolsky 2004 ). 14. If you are interested in the science underneath the conceptual approach please refer to (Walther 2020) . 15. For further details about the methodology and implementation please see Walther (2020) ; and a forthcoming paper on 'Social Change from the inside out. Investing in the emotional resilience and self-efficacy of adolescents in humanitarian contexts' (Walther 2021a) .
