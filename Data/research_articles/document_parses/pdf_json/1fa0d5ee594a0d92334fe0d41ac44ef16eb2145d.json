In most major cities around the world, PT plays a key role. The development of smartphones has enabled making real time, easily accessible journey planning information an integral part of the PT system (Ceder, 2016) . Simultaneously, smartphones and other devices provide information contributing to big data. Thus, as each passenger has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, s/he can send them to the operator via apps so as to improve travel experiences. This illustrates the duality of PT information: (a) informing big data centers which help passenger mobility planning and real-time adjustments, and (b) personalizing passenger preferences using optimal route guidance methodology.

In a study of online shopping systems (Kumar and Benbasat, 2006) , recommendations are shown to affect customer choices. By analogy, we believe recommendations related to a route guidance app, i.e., ordered paths, would affect passengers' route choice. Thus, the order of the paths must be based on different PT attributes rather than a single one. We attain that by adopting the lexicographical ordering approach to determine the set of paths by their order, aligned with passenger preference for certain PT attributes as per a personalized route-recommendation app. The lexicographic ordering method is an appropriate methodology for multicriteria decision analysis. It is well suited to hierarchical consideration of conflicting objectives (Ehrgott, 2005) . Applying lexicographic ordering to the multicriteria pathfinding problem can be traced to Martins (1984) , where a label setting algorithm was developed to find nondominated paths. Martins's method is as an extension of the Dijkstra algorithm in the sense that it extends the min operator in Dijkstra algorithm to a lexicographic min operator. Martins' method was further extended by Gandibleux et al. (2006) to handle bottleneck type criteria. Pulido et al. (2014) developed a label-setting algorithm to find optimal paths satisfying a set of lexicographic goals or minimizing deviation from goals if these cannot be fully satisfied. Another approach to solving the multicriteria pathfinding problem is to develop an aggregate function for converting multiple labels to a single label. Different aggregation functions have been proposed and examined in the literature (Tung and Chew, 1992; Iori et al., 2010; Paix\u00e3o and Santos, 2013) . The algorithm developed in this study is in line with the Martins' method and can be viewed as an extension of the Dijkstra algorithm. In the field of transport behavioral modeling, the application of the lexicographic ordering approach is very limited. To the best of our knowledge, only Karaliopoulos et al. (2017) noticed that lexicographic heuristics are a fast and frugal heuristic approach recognized by behavioral sciences such as psychology and biology and adapted it to model travelers' car-search behavior.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 332, "text": "(Kumar and Benbasat, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1026, "text": "(Ehrgott, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1133, "text": "Martins (1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1437, "text": "Gandibleux et al.

Modeling by this concept allows us to examine and understand a specific cognitive limitation of human behavior. To a certain extent, this law is similar to the framework of bounded rationality recognized by Nobel laureate economist, Simon (1955) .

Generally speaking, the values of weighting parameters could be input by the passengers, using default values or predicted via advanced machine learning algorithms (i.e., Arentze, 2013; Campigotto et al., 2016) . Because of the freedom of setting weighting parameters, across the time of day and day of the week, different passengers could obtain different paths catering to their preferences. This feature indeed achieves a certain degree of personalization. However, the set and order of paths considered and recommended are sensitive to the values of the weighting parameters; if the parameters are not well-calibrated, the path order may not reflect passenger preference order, as is shown below in the example in Section 4. A good personalized route guidance app should, on the one hand, provide satisfactory personalized results, but, on the other hand, minimize passenger effort in inserting input parameters. In addition, using the weighted cost path method implicitly requires that all of the PT attributes be converted to monetary values. In this respect, we note that although such a requirement is generally acceptable in practice and research, there are still investigations and discussions on valuing the PT attributes, such as passenger walking, waiting, and transfer times.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 502, "end": 516, "text": "Arentze, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 517, "end": 541, "text": "Campigotto et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Route guidance methodology"}, {"text": "Nonetheless, for personalized consideration, it is most important to understand and consider human factors in modeling and analysis.

In general, the results demonstrate that both the JND values and distribution of passenger preferences affect the performance of the proposed JND method. Other than the difference between the methodologies, the reasoning behind the distributions shown in the figure can be explicitly ascribed to the data, such that (i) existing randomness generates the parameters of the weights and of the JND threshold values, and (ii) those different variations of the attributes appear across different PT services; for example, between an express bus service with TT = 10 min and WT = 60 min and a regular bus service with TT = 20 min and WT = 30 min. Such differences also warrant activating route guidance tools to provide special attention to the preferred PT attribute. From a PT operation perspective, these large differences of TT and WT can provide input into the design of different paths.
