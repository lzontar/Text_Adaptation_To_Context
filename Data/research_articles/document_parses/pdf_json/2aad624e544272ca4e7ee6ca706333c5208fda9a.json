A third of the global population is on lockdown and a large part of our global economic activity has stopped. Food and access to food has played a visual role in portraying the impact of the outbreak on our society, with images of empty supermarket shelves appearing in mainstream media. In some countries closed schools resulted in many children not having access to free meals and mobilised a number of charities. While parts of the world are now exiting lockdown and measures start relaxing the near future remains uncertain with more waves of the pandemic expected. Given that there is currently no evidence to show that transmission of COVID-19 could occur through food or food packaging there has been limited discussion on the issue, implications and potential future scenarios within the wider food science community.",

We believe that in the future we will continue to see similar pressures in the food system, e.g., comparable pandemics, effects of climate change on food production, and that resilience will become of major importance.",

COVID-19 has been classified as a new zoonotic disease that has been transmitted from animals to humans. Zoonoses are infectious diseases that spread from animals to humans and they are caused by viruses (e.g., Ebola, SARS-CoV), bacteria (Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica), fungi (Basidiobolus ranarum, Lacazia loboi) and parasites (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii) [5] .

In the EU (including UK) it is the largest manufacturing sector employing an estimated 4.72 million people and with a turnover in excess of \u20ac1.2 trillion according to FoodDrinkEurope, 2019 [9] . The sector is diverse with a large number of SMEs and micro SMEs (more than 285,000 companies in the EU). About 0.9% of the companies contribute to almost 50% of the activity, by any metric (e.g. volume of foods produced, employment, and turnover). This has been well recognised, as typical food supply chains are large, vertically integrated, and owned by multinational public and private corporations with a high degree of product diversity [10] . This has also led to \"bottle necks\" in the food chain that might be problematic from a resilience perspective. In Figure 1 , a schematic of the UK food chain, as a typical chain in the western world, is shown. One can see a \"bottle neck\" appearing in supermarkets/suppliers with a relatively small number of organisations controlling a large part of the foods consumed. Further to this bottleneck, more than 80% of food is delivered through the global supply chain with a major focus on low cost and high efficiency. Products and supply chains with emphasis on environmental and social sustainability criteria are gaining momentum but still represent a very small fraction of the total volume.",

Since Nicolas Appert invented canning as a way to preserve agricultural products for extended periods, there has been a range of technological innovations in processing, transportation and cold food chain. The technological innovations combined with access to inexpensive energy (i.e. fossil fuels) have allowed for the development of complex food supply chains. Currently, global megacities with population densities higher than 20,000 people per km 2 are sourcing foods from the rest of the world. It should be noted that there have been questions about the environmental impact of food chains and the true cost of food if the economic effects of impact to the environment is included. Large food organisations have leveraged their scale often to create efficient, centralised operations and a complex supply chain system. The emergence of new sensing, automation and digital technologies in the context of Industry 4.0 (i.e., fourth industrial revolution which aims at integrating cyber-physical systems, the internet of things, industrial internet of things, cloud computing, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence in manufacturing technologies and processes) are promising to provide even greater efficiencies and flexibility. Increasing efficiency in the food industry has minimised inventories (even for non-perishable items) leading to an \"ondemand\" system with high dependence on effective transportation. In the context of resilience, one would have to revisit the impact of such manufacturing and supply chains, especially during a pandemic similar to COVID-19. Figure 1 . Schematic of the UK food chain as a \"representative\" for the western world. Numbers represent the number of actors at each of the chain, size of each part of the chain is getting smaller to represent the relative number of actors.",

One of the greatest challenges in crisis planning is developing food systems that are sufficiently resilient to continue functioning. Buldyrev et al. [12] highlights that a fundamental property of interdependent networks is that failure or degradation in one system may cause the failure of other dependent systems. The same stands for food networks, as for example failure in either the manufacturing, or transportation, may cause the failure to food supply. For example, food industries that rely on import and export face challenges as raw materials might be difficult to source.",

Before the pandemic large food manufacturers reported a relatively slow growth (<3%) while some SMEs reported growths of up to 10%. Innovations with high growth emerge around new propositions, e.g. plant-based foods, which are emerging from risk-taking start-ups. One could speculate that the food sector is moving to an innovation model similar to the one from pharma, where small SMEs develop technologies and then are acquired by multinationals. There are also changes in the way consumers \"interact\" with food. For example, 30% of the calories are consumed outside the home (in the western world) and the average household in the US spends about 20 min in preparing food. At the same time, consumers spend increasingly longer time online (e.g. in the UK the average time spent online was 21h per week in 2015, 50% of which with a smartphone), which has a direct impact in determining their food preferences (e.g. through information flow, adverts) and practices.

These communities may have no food access or are served only by fast food restaurants and convenience stores with few healthy affordable options. Poor access to healthy food options, whilst presenting as a deficiency of certain nutrients, can also result in obesity and increased instances of non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes [14] , often referred to as the double burden of malnutrition. Diets rich in energy from refined foods, high in sugar and fat, are often affordable but lacking in essential macro-and micro-nutrients. Food insecurity and food deserts, as forms of inequality, have severe consequences both in terms of physical and mental health [14, 15, 16, 17] that result from the complex social dynamics at play in marginalised urban areas. The issue of food insecurity is intrinsically multidimensional and emerges from a combination of material (access) and intangible (socio-economic) factors [18] .

High scores correspond to more frequently used terms and are depicted with larger bubbles. Thicker connectors correspond to more frequent co-occurrence of terms. Trimming out weak connections and infrequent terms, the Scopus picture illustrates key terms and their relationships in three main clusters. The green cluster brings together terms closely linked with food supplies and their production ecosystem. Key terms such as disruption, capacity, availability, and vulnerability denote the uncertainty around the food supply chains. The blue cluster is mostly about regulation and the customer. Key issues here are public health, trust, and safety. The red cluster brings in an interesting connection between technology enablers (internet of things, hyperledger/blockchain, sensors, rfid cloud platforms, packaging) and critically important features (traceability, transparency, efficiency, product quality).

Development of enhanced, robust agri-food chains will probably require a fine, complementary balance between the current, \"global\", food supply practices and other, \"local\", trends. Different scenarios would be developed and evaluated taking into account multiple parameters such as pandemic time duration; the global pandemic extend; resilience of different foods; their significance for nutrition and wellbeing. Industry should also identify the essential ingredients with the highest probability of shortage in case of a pandemic(s), and develop strategies for manufacturing their products with alternative ingredients (ideally locally available) or modified recipes which can fit with their production lines without investments. It is important to keep in mind that existing food supply chains are heavily dependent on fossil fuels making them vulnerable. Existing and new technologies, including digital and physical, are likely to play key roles in the operation and maintenance of these enriched agrifood chains, as well as in ensuring food safety and hygienic practices. The academic community is called to identify and discuss the relevant underpinning challenges openly. This requires an interdisciplinary approach that will involve disciplines from food-related sciences/engineering to social or computer sciences, as well as businesses, and policy/regulation representatives.",
