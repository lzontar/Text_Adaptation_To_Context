Methods: We performed comparative analysis of viral metagenomes from four chicken flocks affected with RSS using next-generation sequencing.

A few studies using viral metagenomics could not specify any particular pathogen from the viral community in the chicken flocks with RSS because the distributions of enteric viruses in diseased and healthy flocks were not significantly different [17, 28, 29] . Chicken astrovirus has been distributed worldwide for decades and is nearly ubiquitous constituent of the chicken gut [30] . We also found a high positive detection rate (62.8%) for this virus in the non-RSS-affected chickens. On the other hand, metagenomics analysis in this study showed that only chicken astroviruses were common to chickens that had been diagnosed with RSS via pathological lesions in the crypts of the small intestine. In addition, chicken astrovirus was not identified in the fecal virome of healthy chickens in Brazil [31] . Chicken astrovirus has been suggested as an etiological agent for RSS, but it could be detected in chickens without microscopic lesions. Recently, the pathogenesis of chicken astrovirus in broilers was revealed. Serial passages of the virus from chicken to chicken induced the increased virulence, as shown by decreased weight gain and the presence of histopathological lesions [32] .

Independently, we also identified the full NS gene sequence from chapparvovirus in a single chicken intestine sample. Chapparvovirus, which was recently classified, has been found in various vertebrate animals, such as birds, chickens, pigs, bats and dogs, throughout the world, and many studies have been performed to reveal the properties of this virus [37] . Although trials to identify the whole genome of this virus failed, we have the opportunity for novel viral discovery through environmental metagenomics. In this study, chicken picobirnaviruses from the Republic of Korea were firstly identified using metagenomics, and viral sequences were grouped into genogroups I and II. Avian picobirnaviruses in genogroup I have primarily been noted to date, and those in genogroup II are rarely detected in chickens [17, 29, 38] . We could not design a primer set to detect picobirnaviruses due to the high genetic diversity between chicken picobirnaviruses. The high level of picobirnavirus sequence diversity in various hosts and environmental samples suggests the evolution of heterologous strains [39] .

We suggest that RSS in chickens, which is also called malabsorption syndrome, is caused by a chicken astrovirus.
