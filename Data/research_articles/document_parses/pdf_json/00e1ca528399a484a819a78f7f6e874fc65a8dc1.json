There are multiple potential explanations for the variation in case number and disease spread between South Korea and Italy, including differences in demographic characteristics (e.g., Italy has the second-oldest population in the world) [45] or even different viral strains [46] .

This approach was also successfully deployed in Hong Kong and Singapore in order to rapidly contain outbreaks [47] . The realization that many of the early cases in South Korea were associated with a single organization likely facilitated an initially focused intense response which was then broadened throughout the country. This containment strategy works best in relatively small populations with good public health and healthcare infrastructure, where administering and analyzing tests and contact tracing are feasible. Italy's response was largely a \"lockdown\" strategy, which included mandatory quarantine, shelter-in-place orders or recommendations, bans on public gatherings, and closure of businesses. The success of this strategy depends on maintaining the isolation of individuals -whether self-imposed or enforced -and can be highly variable across geographic jurisdictions. Further, this approach typically results in additional waves of cases as restrictions are lifted, as has been seen in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. These locations have reintroduced restrictions, in order to address the upswing in cases subsequent to relaxing the initial restrictions [47] . Thus, the lockdown strategy is most beneficial in terms of slowing the epidemic but, alone, does not lead to containment. In Utah, adequate containment of viral spread, seen to be beneficial elsewhere through mandatory shelter-in-place orders, has not been realized, likely due to the inconsistency of such orders.

The geographic isolation of South Korea limits the generalizability of this country's experience to the United States. Entry into South Korea via a land border is extremely limited, as the only land border is the Demilitarized Zone with North Korea. South Korea is well connected to the rest of the world via air travel, but the number of airports with an international service is relatively small. As it is a peninsula, there is a long oceanic border, but South Korea does not have close neighbors by sea. This geographic isolation may be an important, non-modifiable factor explaining some of the differences in the containment and control of the viral outbreak between South Korea and other countries. Italy is also a peninsula, but it is in the heart of Europe with many connections to other countries by land, air, and sea. The geographic situation for Italy is more similar to most U.S. states than the South Korean context. As a land-locked state which also serves as a transportation hub in the Intermountain West, Utah's geography and unlimited restriction on interstate transportation add to challenges associated with the movement of individuals. Additionally, the stark inconsistency of prevention measures across municipalities and jurisdictions within the state further complicate the success rates of various policies. For example, Salt Lake City, the state's capitol and largest city, issued a stay-in-place proclamation. The proclamation, however, applies only to those living within the city's political boundaries, and jurisdiction of the rule does not extend to those who travel to the city for work or other reasons.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The potential impact of these two models on Utah are substantially different. With the South Korea model, Utah will have a pandemic peak around the beginning of April, with a likely maximum of 169 new cases per day and a cumulative total of around 3245 cases. With the Italy model, Utah would peak the second week of April with a maximum of around 250 new cases per day and a cumulative total of upwards of 9857 cases over the six months of the pandemic. In reviewing the difference in strategies, testing figures heavily into the equation. South Korea sought out and tested those who were potentially exposed and used the public health tools of quarantine and isolation. Italy depended primarily on the public health tools of extreme social distancing and testing of symptomatic cases only. This would suggest that for Utah to have an experience closer to South Korea, extensive and coordinated testing would be in order. The testing should focus primarily on contacts of cases with quarantine of exposed individuals and isolation of those testing positive.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was in China, we decided to use other countries as a reference for the two extremes in our modeling for several reasons. First, the stability of the initial numbers from China were questionable given that it was not clear then that a new pandemic has been emerging. Second, we believe that COVID-19 behaves in a self-similar fashion geospatially in its spread trajectory or growth with the understanding that the size of the exposed population and the timing of containment measures at the beginning of the spread could modify the peak numbers and cumulative numbers of the pandemic. In fact, a recent study has shown that the number of infected people with time in the most impacted and unprepared countries in urban settings, indeed exhibit an asymptotic power law behavior confirming the self-similar property or fractal time growth of the COVID-19 pandemic [48] . Thus, there is no loss of generality in choosing Italy over China as one of the extremes in our modeling.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 902, "end": 906, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The uniqueness of our approach is that it uses available daily rates of spread within South Korea and Italy to predict the total number of new cases in Utah for the lagging days in the pandemic between Utah and those two countries. The novel aspect of this approach is the use of case studies of outbreaks of the same organism in the recent past to provide rapid estimates of the potential impact in areas lagging in the development of the pandemic. In this way, one can expand the training set used in the fit of the cumulative number of cases, plotted as a function of time, as the only input necessary for the forecast in the log-logistic growth model. While such an approach may provide fairly accurate estimates for the times nearer to the date of extrapolation, it is less robust for further extrapolations as seen in Figure 3b ,c. The 95% confidence intervals of the forecasted number of new cases in these figures gives clear indication that one could rely on such methodology with a high level of certainty for at least the first 1-2 months of the extrapolation, a critical period for control of the outbreak. It is very possible to improve the performance of our forecast by using weights to account for the number of conducted daily tests.

While a number of non-modifiable factors likely explain the success, or lack thereof, of jurisdictional mitigation and containment efforts, it is highly likely that differences in public health actions also play a significant role, allowing communities anticipating the virus to learn and adapt from action plans that have proven effective. In the current study, we identify a three-month variation in the likely length of the pandemic, a 1.5-fold difference in the number of daily infections, and a 3-fold difference in the expected cumulative cases when applying the experience of two developed countries in handling this virus to the Utah context. These variations, and the public health, morbidity, and mortality impacts they connote, both describe the possible distribution of outcomes for one U.S. state, as well as provide a cautionary warning about which public health actions must be urgently emulated and adapted to minimize the impact of the epidemic, and which are likely to result in local catastrophe.
