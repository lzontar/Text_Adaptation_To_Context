This COVID-19 epidemic is somewhat similar to the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2 or SARS; [2002] [2003] and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS; 2012-ongoing) outbreaks. All these infections could be traced to zoonotic transmission. All 3 viral infections have similar clinical presentation with fever and cough leading to lower respiratory tract disease with significant mortality especially in the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. These infections can be confirmed by nucleic acid testing of respiratory tract samples (eg, throat swabs) though initial clinical diagnosis is based on symptoms, exposures, and chest imaging. Since no specific effective antiviral drugs are available for these diseases, supportive care is of paramount importance (1).",

This facilitates the viral genes to enter the host cell to be copied, producing more viruses. It was reported that the SARS-CoV-2 spike was 10e20 times more likely to bind ACE2 on human cells than the spike from the SARS virus from 2002, which enable SARS-CoV-2 to spread more easily from person to person than the earlier virus (4). Despite similarities in sequence and structure between the spikes of the two viruses, three different antibodies against the 2002 SARS virus could not successfully bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, suggesting that potential vaccine and antibody-based treatment strategies need to be more specific to SARS-CoV-2.",

In this process of protecting the body against the onslaught by the microorganisms, there could occur some amount of inevitable inflammation, injury and cell/tissue damage. In order to repair the tissue damage as a consequence of attack by the invading organisms and the resultant inflammatory process, resolution of inflammation and wound healing process need to occur in a coordinated and orderly fashion to restore homeostasis. Thus, the infection induced by the invading microorganisms could be local or systemic whereas the resolution of inflammation and wound healing and restoration of homeostasis is more a local process. For all these events to occur, there need to be a cross-talk among invading organisms, tissues that they attack, immune system, inflammatory events associated cells and resolution initiating and inducing cells/tissues and their molecules.",

            "text": "In this context, it is noteworthy that polyunsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites (termed as bioactive lipids) seem to have a crucial role. It is known that Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, group A streptococci present on normal human skin are rendered ineffective to cause any infection by the skin surface lipids, especially unsaturated fatty acids. Group A streptococcus exposed to oleic acid (OA, 18:1n-9) die within 5 minutes of exposure as a result of an alteration in the integrity of the cell membrane (5) . In addition, oleic acid enriched mouse peritoneal macrophages showed 3e4 fold greater erythrophagocytic capacity compared to palmitic acid-enriched macrophages (6) . Staphylococci in the lung alveoli are killed mainly outside alveolar macrophages that seem to reside in the highly unsaturated arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) present in the surfactant (7e11). Other unsaturated fatty acids: linoleic, oleic, and palmitoleic also showed anti-bacterial activity but were less potent compared to AA that is effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses, including influenza and HIV (8e21). The mechanism of the antimicrobial action of AA and other fatty acids may include their ability to induce leakage and even lysis of microbial cell membranes (including disruption of viral protein envelopes), as well as various cellular metabolic effects, including but not limited to inhibition of respiratory activity, effects on transportation of amino acids, and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (21e24). Based on these evidences, it is reasonable to suggest that alveolar macrophages, leukocytes, T and B cells, NK cells and other immunocytes release AA and other unsaturated fatty acids into their surrounding milieu when challenged by various microorganisms including viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS, in turn, inactivate these invading organisms and thus, protect lungs and other tissues. This could be one of the fundamental mechanisms employed by human body to protect itself from various microbes. This implies that a deficiency of AA and other unsaturated fatty acids may render a person more susceptible to various infections including SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS.",

In view of the fact that SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS are enveloped viruses, they can be easily inactivated by AA and other unsaturated fatty acids. This implies that oral or intravenous administration of these fatty acids may enhance recovery from these infections and when present in adequate amounts in immunocytes and body fluids (especially in the alveolar fluid) may actually prevent these infections.",
