The total recovered information is unavailable for UK, Spain, Sweden and Netherlands. There were two countries, Uganda and Vietnam, the total deaths were not reported. To investigate whether the Current BCG vaccination countries have lower number of COVID-19 confirmed cases than non-Current BCG vaccination countries, the Poisson regression models were used with population size (in log-scale) as the offset to take into account the possible impact from various population size. As shown in the model 1 of Table 1 , after adjusting for the effect of population size, the (intensity) rates ratio (RR) of COVID-19 confirmed cases for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.135 (with 95% CI= (0.135,0.136)). In other words, the (intensity) rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases for those countries with Current BCG vaccination was 86.5% (=1-0.135) significantly lower than those non-Current BCG vaccination countries (p-value < 0.001), after adjusting for the effect of population size. The number of confirmed cases might be influenced by multiple factors. It has been reported the number of COVID-19 reported cases might be dramatically underestimated around the world due to the lowest rate of diagnostic tests and poor testing quality in lower income countries 20, 21 . Accordingly, in order to account for that, we further analyzed with adjustment of the effects of countries' economies by adding it into the previous Poisson regression model. As shown in the Model 2 of Table 1 , the (intensity) rates ratio of COVID-19 confirmed cases for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.339 (95% CI= (0.338,0.340)). In other words, the (intensity) rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases for those countries with Current BCG vaccination was 66.1% significantly lower than those non-Current BCG vaccination countries (p-value < 0.001), after adjusting for the additional effects of countries' economic statuses.",

Also, the clinical trial use BCG as the therapeutic vaccine for COVID-19 confirmed cases in Brazil (NCT04369794). And the observational, case-control, study in Egypt is examining the severity of disease in COVID-19 positive patients who are tested positive for past BCG exposure compared with tested negative (NCT04347876). In summary, the data in this study might support the heterologous immune effects of BCG on prevention of COVID-19 virus infection as well as reduction of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. The protective effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 may be caused by boosting of the innate immune response by BCG. It has been shown that the exaggerated cytokine responses might be associated with complications in patientswith COVID-19.26 As cautioned by the WHO 27 and the global shortage of BCG supply, 28 it might need to further discuss the therapeutic strategy of BCG vaccination.",

Among those (coronavirus) infected (COVID-19 confirmed) cases, the odds ratio (OR) of death for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.396 (with 95% CI = (0.394,0.399)), as shown in Model 1 of Table 2. In other words, the odds of death due to coronavirus infected for those countries with Current BCG vaccination was 60.4% (=1-0.396) significantly lower than those non-Current BCG vaccination countries (p-value < 0.001), ignoring other factors' effects. Similarly, as shown in the Model 2 of Table 2, after adjusting for the effects of countries' economies, the OR of death after (coronavirus) infected for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.258 (with 95% CI = (0.254,0.261)). In other words, the odds of death due to coronavirus infected for those countries with Current BCG vaccination was 74.2% significantly lower than those non-Current BCG vaccination countries (p-value < 0.001). Accordingly, the data suggests that BCG vaccination seem to significantly reduce mortality associated with COVID-19. We further investigated whether BCG vaccination increases the recovery rate of COVID-19. Among those (coronavirus) infected (COVID-19 confirmed) cases, the OR of recovery for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 1.337 (with 95% CI = (1.333,1.341)), as shown in the Model 1 of Table 3. In other words, the odds of recovery from COVID-19 confirmed for those countries with current BCG vaccination was 33.7% (=1.337-1) significantly higher than those non-Current BCG vaccination countries (p-value < 0.001), ignoring other factors' effects. Similarly, as shown in the Model 2 of Table 3, after adjusting for the effects of countries' economies, the OR of recovery from coronavirus infection for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 2.151 (with 95% CI = (",
