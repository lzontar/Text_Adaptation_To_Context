To do this, after setting s and vf, we performed 5,000 simulations and we recorded the ratio between the total number of swab tests required, T, and N. For twostep sequential pooling, T includes both H and V pools required in steps B and C, but also validation tests in step D on all the swabs from subjects not previously excluded. Since, without a pooling strategy, N tests should be performed, the ratio T/N measures the efficacy of the proposed procedure. The smaller is its value, the larger is the reduction of required tests. Conversely, values close to 1 (or even above 1) would represent a useless (or a counter-productive) strategy.

For very small pools (s=3), with a low virus frequency, the number of tests required is about 40% with our procedure as compared to separately testing each subject. As vf moves to larger values, the number of tests grows slowly and the pooling is still efficient (T/N<1) even if 25% of the subjects are positive in the group.

Active case detection, rapid case isolation and contact quarantine, as well as rigorous application of infection control practices are successful strategies in controlling SARS-CoV2 infection outbreaks.
