Hence, drugs that can interfere the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to hACE2 potentially 23 can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 from entering human cells. Here, based on the N-terminal helix \u03b11 of 24 human ACE2, we designed nine short peptides that have potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding. 25 Molecular dynamics simulations of peptides in the their free and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-bound forms 26 allow us to identify fragments that are stable in water and have strong binding affinity to the SARS-27 CoV-2 spike proteins.

The RBD of spike protein is 251 known to interact with the human ACE2 receptor. Hence the disruption of interaction between 252 RBD and ACE2 is an attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 related 253 disease. In present study, we have identified peptide fragments from the N-terminal region of 254 human ACE2 and investigated their interactions with the spike RBD. MD simulations of peptide 255 fragments with RBD provided insights into important interacting residues at the interface between 256 ACE2 and RBD. We analyzed the conformational stabilities of peptide fragments in water. Three 257 peptide fragments, SIF6, SIF8 and SIF9 appeared to be unstable in water and also showed weak 258 binding with RBD. Among all fragments, the SIF3 showed strongest binding to the RBD. MD 259 simulation data suggest that residues (24-26 and 39-42) of the ACE2 play important roles in the 260 binding of peptides to the RBD.
