Our study found males and females were all vulnerable to the disease, indicating gender may not be a risk factor of developing the disease. The infected patients could be found at all ages, and most patients were found at the age of 20 to 80. Research showed the infection of COVID-19 is self-limited, people whom could recover in a strong immune system. 16 And the younger would be in a lower likelihood of infection because of a faster immune response mechanism. 17 Elder population were in a higher risk to be infected owning to lack of knowledge of disease prevention or having chronic conditions. 18, 19 Cough and fatigue were mostly found among patients, which were consistent with the findings of Shi et al and Wu et al 20, 21 It is also important to carry out differential diagnosis from patients with common cold, especially when they had epidemiological exposure history. 22 We noticed that asymptomatic infection took up a small proportion among patients, although it varied from each city. The discrimination of asymptomatic patients was mostly from imaging screening in light of epidemiological exposure history. 23, 24 As the asymptomatic did not present any clinical signs or symptoms but still excrete coronavirus and could become a source of infection, 25, 26 it is necessary to detect the inapparent infection from population and prevent the disease from further spread.",

Since chest CT could identify the early phrase of the disease infection, it has been recommended as one of major evidence for COVID-19 diagnosis and public health surveillance. 27 Yang et al 28 has proved chest CT could be used to quickly assess patients with severity of the novel coronavirus. Research found the disease is mainly transmitted through respiratory tract and interpersonal contact. 10, 22 Since closely contact with confirmed cases was the leading cause to COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, it is of great importance to quarantine the population with epidemiological exposure to prevent disease transmission. 29, 30 In the meanwhile, public space as well as transportation could be closed or suspended for the spread of infectious disease. In this study, pregnant cases have not been found, however, we still need to pay attention to this special group, relevant guidelines should be made for the management of this group. 31 The day of onset-admission interval was shorter than the initially reported cases in Wuhan, 9 while was a bit longer than days in Shanghai. 32 This indictor was supposed to reflect the effectiveness and capacity of public health emergency system, and it is regarded as a better health system with a shorter interval for admission. 33 As of the quick response to the COVID-19 treatment, the local government has provided the effective detecting device such as the kit for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction as well as taken strictly measures to control the disease, which shortened the diagnostic time significantly. 12 We found in ",

And other key measures have been taken subsequently, for instance, public gathering was prohibited and public transportation had been suspended. In addition, each city carried out relevant steps targeting on efficient controlling disease. As Wenzhou had more people exposed to epidemiological factors, the local government conducted a large-scale screening for timely detection of potential cases.

Patients within age 14 to 49 accounted for a larger proportion and were ranked by an age group of 50 to 64. The younger suffered the less to COVID-19 in four cities.Although the proportion of clinical symptoms differed from each city, symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue were commonly found among patients, and symptoms of sore throat, sputum production, headache, and chill were also co-existing on patients. In addition, we noticed that asymptomatic infection cases made up a small proportion among cities, whom performed healthy even during the illness.

The government was the earliest to set the first level response to this public health emergency in China after interpersonal transmission identified.4,12 Moreover, other epidemic prevention measures have been implemented, for example, provincial government officially announced the daily confirmed and suspected cases, stopped all interprovincial roads transportation as well as promptly launched on a epidemic collection system, ensuring population health information were under surveillance.34,35 Also, hospitals adopted a centralized treatment for COVID-19 patients and integrated the research into clinics.36 At the same time, local business also played a significant role in this event. For instance, the Alibaba company has developed a program of Health Code, collecting the data of personal information, traveling history, epidemic contact history and clinical symptoms.37 The risk of disease was presented by different colors in Health Code. The green color meant a healthy status, in which persons were allowed to freely walk around in the city, the yellow represented a medium risk, indicating people should have been quarantined at home or clinics for 7 days, and the red suggested a higher risk of having COVID-19, for people should be centralized quarantined for 14 days. By using the digital technology, the Health Code supported the government on the control of further spread of the disease.",
