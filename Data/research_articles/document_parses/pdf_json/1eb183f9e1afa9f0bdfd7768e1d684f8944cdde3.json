            "text": "The neutron star merger GW170817 marked the begin ning of multi messenger astronomy because it was the first gravitational wave event with a recorded electro magnetic counterpart 1 . As the neutron stars merged, they released a short flash of gamma rays, followed by electro magnetic radiation from different processes including the radioactive radiation emitted in the formation of heavy elements -a fireworks show known as a kilonova. Less than 2 s after the merger was detected by LIGO and Virgo, the Fermi Gamma ray Burst Monitor independently detected the gamma ray burst. Telescopes around the world started looking for the electro magnetic radiation and neutrinos, with more than 50 teams of astronomers mobilized for the task. \"It was majestic science, but also a very intense experience, \" says Mansi Kasliwal, principal investigator of GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen), an international collabo ration studying fast changing events (transients) such as supernovae, neutron stars or black hole mergers using a network of telescopes around the world. The amount of data recorded kept scientists busy for months with the full analysis. But already by October 2017 more than 30 papers had been published in various journals includ ing varied results such as a new measurement of the Hubble constant 2 and the confirmation that heavy ele ments are created in such neutron star mergers through the rapid neutron capture process 3 .",

            "text": "A different beast GW190425 was different and surprising. It was another neutron star merger, but no electromagnetic counter part was found. The combined mass of this binary sys tem (about 3.4 solar masses) is much larger than was expected from the known galactic neutron star bina ries 4 . Interestingly, the event was detected only by the Livingston interferometer, because the Hanford detector was temporarily offline at the time and the Virgo data had a low signal to noise ratio. Still, the data from Virgo were useful to identify the area of the sky from which the event originated. GW190425 left astronomers reassessing the existing theories of how neutron star pairs are formed. More data and new simulations are needed to solve the puzzle of the unexpectedly high mass of the merger.",

However, some alerts were sent to astronomers when events were detected with a high con fidence level. In O3, things changed completely with the debut of the new public alert system. This automated sys tem sends an alert within minutes of the detection of a grav itational wave event. Not all alerts survive closer scrutiny and some are retracted. However, the public alerts allow astronomers to respond swiftly with multi messenger hunts for an electromagnetic counterpart.",

But at the same time he stresses that the public alerts \"only provide a very limi ted amount of information, essentially the key infor mation that allows astronomers to point telescopes at the right region of the sky at the right time. \" To confirm the nature of an event and characterize it, a full ana lysis is required and that can take months of rigorous examination of the data.",

            "text": "One candidate event in the O3 caught everyone's eyes: the merger detected on 14 August 2019, named in the public alert system as S190814bv (the GW naming is given only after the full analysis has been completed). This event is possibly a neutron star-black hole merger, although that has yet to be confirmed. Although there have been other hints, such an event would be a first to be detected, and could have an associated electro magnetic counterpart. \"That would surely be big news as far as astronomy is concerned, and there is a lot of excitement surrounding this possibility, \" says Vecchio. The event was followed up by many teams. \"We found a tantalizing counterpart called DG19wxnjc which photo metrically showed all the hallmark signatures of a kilo nova, \" says Kasliwal. Unfortunately, the near infrared spectrum from the Keck telescope betrayed the event as a supernova, so it was not associated with S190814bv. \"What this guy really is, I'm afraid everyone will need to wait until we complete the analysis and publish the paper, \" says Vecchio.",

The implications of the COVID19 pandemic have yet to be grasped, but they likely mean a delay for the upgrades planned to start by 2021. For the next operating run, O4, scheduled for late 2021 or early 2022, the plan was to use these upgrades to increase the sensitivity of the LIGO inter ferometers by as much as 60% for Hanford and 40% for Livingston.",
