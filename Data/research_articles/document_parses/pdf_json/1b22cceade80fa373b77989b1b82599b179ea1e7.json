These terminal sequences are highly conserved across most of the paramyxoviruses [12,15] and house the regulatory signals for virus replication [16] .

Experiments involving the swapping of NP between pathogenically different strains revealed a change in virulence of the generated recombinant virus only when NP along with its other replication proteins partners (P and L) were swapped together [18] . Notably, the NP encapsidates the entire genomic RNA while the L functions as an RNA-dependent Viruses 2020, 12, 451 3 of 23 RNA polymerase that binds to P protein and forms a complex that recognizes the RNP for initiating the process of transcription and replication [19] . Recent evidence has indicated that the L protein can significantly contribute to NDV virulence through its role in virus replication [20] . However, specific regions within the L protein responsible for determining NDV virulence are yet to be discovered. The F protein is the major determinant of NDV virulence. It is synthesized in an inactive form, F 0 , and then becomes activated following its proteolytic cleavage into F1 and F2. The enzyme involved in the cleavage is determined by the amino acid composition of the cleavage site, which in turn varies in virulent and avirulent NDV strains [21] . Avirulent pathotypes generally have a monobasic F cleavage site acted upon by extracellular trypsin like proteases. On the other hand, the virulent strains have multiple basic amino acid residues at their cleavage sites that are activated by intracellular proteases of the furin family [22] . In addition to the cleavage site's amino acid composition, the sites of post translational modifications, notably glycosylation sites, may play a significant role in the virus virulence. Recently, [23] observed an increase in virus virulence following deletion of N glycans from the heptad repeats of the NDV F protein. Furthermore, [24] showed a dramatic increase in NDV virulence when the cytoplasmic tail from a mesogenic strain was used to replace its counterparts in another lentogenic strain, suggesting the possible role of the F protein's cytoplasmic domain in determining the virulence of NDV. The HN protein is also believed to be a determinant of NDV virulence. Depending on the location of the termination codon, the HN protein has several subtypes of varying length, with most of the avirulent strains encoding the longest protein made up of 616 amino acids. In contrast, the virulent strains encode the shortest HN proteins of about 571 amino acids. Lentogenic strains such as LaSota and B1 encode an HN protein of 577 amino acids in length [25] . Other lengths of HN protein reported include 572, 580, 582, and 585 amino acids. To investigate whether the HN length diversity is directly associated with the virus virulence, several NDV chimeras with shortened or extended HN length were generated by reverse genetics and tested for pathogenicity using standard procedures. It was revealed that varying the lengths of HN directly affects the functions related to viral replication but not pathogenicity [26] . V protein, a non-structural protein encoded by the p gene, also plays a vital role in determining NDV virulence. The role of V protein is clearly manifested during viral pathogenesis as an interferon antagonist, by selectively targeting STAT-1 for degradation [27] . Recombinant NDVs that cannot express V protein often show no evidence of growth in 9-10 days chicken embryonated eggs and a very impaired growth in cell culture. Those recombinant viruses also manifest sensitivity to exogenous interferon administration, indicating that the V protein plays a role in NDV replication and virulence [27] .

Upon arrival at the GE, the polymerase complex terminates transcription, scans through the intergenic region, and then starts transcription of the next gene and continues in that order until it transcribes the last gene, from where it finally dissociates from the RNA [31] . As the transcription progresses, the synthesized mRNAs are translated into viral proteins whose accumulation in the cell causes the viral polymerase to switch from transcription to replication of the entire viral genome. Further details of the NDV replication cycle have been discussed elsewhere [32] . Noteworthy, efficient replication of NDV can only occur when the genomic length of the virus size is in a multiple of six. This phenomenon is referred to \"rule of six\" and occurs because during replication, the NP of most paramyxoviruses is associated with exactly six nucleotides on the genomic RNA [33] .

Viruses generated by reverse genetics can be engineered to either encode desired mutations in the indigenous viral genes or express heterologous antigens as additional proteins. Reverse genetics is therefore a state-of-the-art recombinant DNA technology with considerable impact in modern vaccine design, development and delivery. The first group of viruses known to be amenable to reverse genetics were the positive sense RNA viruses [35] whose genetic material has the same polarity as cellular mRNA and therefore can directly act as templates for protein synthesis. However, owing to peculiar complexities and challenges associated with the replication of negative sense RNA viruses, reverse genetics could not be immediately applied to manipulate those viruses [31] until in 1994 when rabies virus became the first negative sense RNA virus to be successfully rescued from its cloned cDNA [36] .

To rescue a recombinant NDV, the full length cDNA construct and the helper plasmids are co-delivered at an optimized ratio, into cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase for the initiation of virus infectious cycle [38] . Commonly used cells in NDV recovery are human epitheloid carcinoma (Hep-2) cells infected with modified vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase and genetically engineered Baby Hamster kidney cells (BST-T7) that constitutively express the T7 polymerase. Immediately after transfection, viral RNA will be transcribed from the full length construct and the proteins expressed from helper plasmids will associate to produce the RNP template. Unfortunately, this particular step is largely inefficient and, therefore, the most rate-limiting step in NDV reverse genetics [32] . Once RNP is intracellularly organized, the virus infectious life cycle becomes activated. In a nut shell, the success of generating an infectious virus from a cloned full length cDNA of NDV requires the precise transcription of the full length construct into a viral RNA; optimal co-expression of the NP, P and L genes at a level sufficient to kick-start the replication process; as well as the expression of other viral genes for onward progression of the replication process and the release of the assembled viral particles ( Figure 1 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 271, "end": 275, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 652, "end": 656, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1232, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1763, "end": 1771, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Recovery of Recombinant NDV"}, {"text": "The difficulties associated with NDV reverse genetics are largely due to the need to co-transfect at least four plasmid constructs into the same cell. In order to enhance the transfection efficiency, [39] developed a two-plasmid reverse genetics system that dramatically improved the rescue efficiency of NDV. When compared with the conventional four plasmid system, the newly developed system appeared to be superior, enabling an earlier and increased amount of the recovered viruses. In some cases, viruses that could not be rescued using the traditional system were successfully recovered with the aid of this improved reverse genetics system. More recently, a single plasmid-based NDV reverse genetics system was developed [40] . In this approach, the full length construct under the control of T7 promoter was designed to have additional T7 promoter sequences upstream of the GS of P and L genes. Thus, when the plasmid was transfected into cells earlier infected with a fowl pox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase, a full length viral RNA and two subgenomic RNAs were transcribed. Arguably, some of the subgenomic and full length viral RNAs might be capped and polyadenylated, respectively, at 5 and 3 ends by some of the fowl pox enzymes.

Therefore, mere delivery of this single plasmid into cells infected with FP-T7 leads to the assembly of RNP intracytoplasmically, and the eventual production of infectious virus particle. To substantiate the point that the fowl pox enzymes were responsible for the capping and polyadenylation of the subgenomic RNAs, the same plasmid construct was transfected into BSR cells constitutively expressing T7 polymerase and no virus was rescued.

In the first place, the genome of NDV, unlike those of pox and herpes viruses, is simple and encodes only a few structural proteins, which reduces the number of proteins expressed along with the FG and, therefore, enhances the specific immune response against the expressed heterologous proteins [19] . Secondly, each gene has conserved GS and GE sequences, respectively, at its 3 and 5 ends, which implies that foreign antigens can be efficiently expressed in the same manner as indigenous NDV proteins, when flanked with those transcriptional signals [32] .

The live attenuated vaccines may be highly immunogenic but are not recommended by the OIE due to the potential for novel subtype emergence as a result of genetic reassortment [80] . Thus, alternative vaccine platforms must be explored to control the menace of this fatal avian pathogen.

Therefore, conventional live attenuated Ebola vaccines are not likely to be safe due to the possibility of their reversion back to virulence. Moreover, inactivated Ebola vaccines that have been shown to be safe can only induce a suboptimal immune response that incompletely protects against lethal Ebola virus challenge [122] . Thus, there is the need for a safer and more effective vaccine platform. Among all the next generation Ebola vaccines, recombinant virus vectored vaccines appear to be the most promising. Rabies virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus expressing Ebola GP are some of the recent vaccines that are currently under clinical trials in humans [123, 124] .

This natural oncolytic tendency of NDV has been demonstrated both in cell culture systems and different animal models [129] . In fact, many oncolytic NDV strains are currently at various stages of clinical trials for use in humans. One of the possible mechanisms of this selective replication of NDV in cancerous cells is the differential activation of interferon signaling pathways in normal and cancerous cells. Normal human cells are equipped with the RIG-I receptor that efficiently senses the presence of NDV and elicits a measurable interferon response [130] . On the other hand, most human cancers have defective interferon pathways, and so they cannot easily antagonize the invasion and replication of NDV. Nevertheless, some NDV strains have been shown to efficiently replicate in cancers with an intact interferon antiviral system, suggesting the involvement of other mechanisms of NDV-induced oncolysis [131] . Previously, NDV has been shown to stimulate the upregulated expression of TNF-related apoptotic-inducing ligands (TRAIL) on monocytes leading to tremendous oncolytic effects in tumor cells bearing the TRAIL-R2 receptor [132] . Similarly, NDV has been shown to induce apoptosis in many cancer cell lines by triggering certain endoplasmic reticulum stress in a manner independent of P53 gene expression [133] . Thus, the oncolytic efficacy of NDV could also be related to its ability to stimulate both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. Other mechanisms of NDV-induced oncolysis include the upregulated expression of major histocompatibility molecules and cell adhesion receptors as well as the increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines around the tumor site [134] . In summary, the strategies of NDV-mediated oncolysis can be broadly classified into those involving the manipulation of the cellular antiviral and anti-apoptotic pathways as well as other indirect mechanisms that involve the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 262, "text": "[129]", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 698, "end": 703, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1058, "text": "[131]", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1285, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1462, "end": 1467, "text": "[133]", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1834, "end": 1839, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Molecular Mechanisms of NDV Induced Oncolysis"}, {"text": "Despite the widely known oncolytic efficacy of wild type NDV, certain types of cancer are still resistant to the activity of the virus [134] . With the advent of reverse genetics, however, strategies of improving the oncolytic efficacy of the virus have emerged [135] . One of those strategies involves the manipulation of the F protein cleavage site of the virus. In one study, avirulent NDV was reported to have been engineered to encode polybasic instead of monobasic F cleavage site. When the recombinant virus was evaluated for anticancer activity, it was found to have a dramatically increased cell-to-cell fusion activity, replication kinetics, and tumoricidal effects in many human cancerous cell lines compared to the wild type virus [136] . This suggests an improved therapeutic potential of the virus. However, since NDV with a polybasic F cleavage site is potentially pathogenic in chicken, its usage as a cancer vaccine in humans is nowadays discouraged because of the fear of accidental spillage into the environment. Hence, the current focus is the generation of recombinant NDV that demonstrates excellent antitumor effects in humans while retaining its safety profile in chicken [137] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 135, "end": 140, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 262, "end": 267, "text": "[135]", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 743, "end": 748, "text": "[136]", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 1196, "end": 1201, "text": "[137]", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Recombinant NDV as an Improved Oncolytic Agent"}, {"text": "In line with the current research focus in NDV oncolytics, [138] generated a type-1 interferon sensitive avirulent NDV by abrogating its V protein expression.

Unfortunately, the oncolytic prospects of this recombinant virus are limited to only cancers with a non-functional interferon pathway since the virus is interferon sensitive. Therefore, in order to overcome this limitation, [135] created two major alterations in the genome of an avirulent NDV and recovered the recombinant virus using reverse genetics. These alterations are the modification of the F cleavage site from monobasic to polybasic and the insertion of influenza NS-1 gene into a lentogenic NDV backbone. While the creation of the polybasic cleavage site stands to improve cell-to-cell spread of the virus in cancerous cells, the influenza NS-1 protein through its potent anti-interferon and anti-apoptotic properties, allows the virus to evade the innate immune response following infection [136] .
