To profitably use this model, the most suitable values of its parameters must be found. The estimation of the SEIR-SD model parameters takes place here through the use of Differential Evolution, a heuristic optimization technique. In this way, we are able to evaluate for each of the three above-mentioned scenarios the daily number of infectious cases from today until the end of virus spreading, the day(s) in which this number will be at its highest peak, and the day in which the infected cases will become very close to zero.",

It is a heuristic population-based optimization technique that has proved itself extremely useful to find optimal or sub-optimal solutions to multidimensional real-valued problems, even multi-objective and constrained, taken from many different fields. This means that DE can often find a good set of values for the variables of these problems, even for large sets up to, say, hundreds of variables, We wish to apply these models the spreading of coronavirus Covid-19 that is taking place in these days in Italy, consequently we have downloaded the related data, that is publicly available at 5 thanks to Italian Ministry for Health.",

Then, after a few days, some general rules of thumb were suggested, as avoiding unnecessary travels and exits from homes and, in such cases, keeping at a distance of at least one metre from other people. As the situation started to get worse, some parts of Italy were isolated, and later on movements within Italy were more and more limited. With time, more and more activities and shops were closed by Government. Finally, even going out from homes was very strictly limited by law.

The cardinality of the population is termed population size (P s ) and is kept constant during the evolution. Each time a solution is created, its quality at solving the problem is evaluated by means of a suitable fitness function \u03a6, that must be optimized. Then starting from the current population, a new one is created for the next generation thanks to the use of a suitable mutation mechanism. Many different mechanisms exist, basically each of them starts from the generic i-th individual, receives in input a set of other randomly-chosen current individuals (two, three, or four) and, based on the values of two parameters, named mutation factor (F) and crossover ratio (C r ), mixes their features to those of the i-th individual so as to obtain a new trial individual. This latter is compared to the corrent i-th one, and the better enters the new population under construction. This mechanism is repeated for P s times at each generation, so that at the end we will obtain the new P s -sized new population for next generation. This is repeated for a number of generations represented by G. The individual with the best fitness value in the final population is the solution found by the algorithm. For the problem at hand, Differential Evolution should find the most suitable values for the three parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3.

The resulting mechanism has been applied to model the spreading of the coronavirus Covid-19 in Italy and in two of its most important regions, i.e., Lombardy and Campania. Consequently, we have been able to evaluate the evolution over time of the daily number of infectious cases from today until the end of virus spreading. This has allowed us to estimate the day(s) in which this number will be at its highest peak, as well as the day in which the infected cases will become very close to zero.",
