The HTC contacted the patient by phone as part of their TM programme identifying that he had anosmia and a dry cough. At that point he was sent to the HTC, where he tested positive using SARS-COV-2 PCR. The chest computed tomography angiography did not show COVID-19-compatible affectation or pulmonary thromboembolism. He presented no elevation of inflammatory parameters (IL-6 or ferritin) and no activation of coagulation (no D-dimer elevation). Despite this, given the thrombotic risk that could be caused by COVID-19 together with the treatment with emicizumab we started treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at prophylactic doses with strict control with anti-Xa. The second patient, a male diagnosed with SHB with inhibitor, a health care worker, had discontinued treatment with concizumab one week earlier. He was SARS-COV-2 PCR positive and the only symptoms he presented were anosmia and dysgeusia with elevated Ddimer (twice its normal value) and lymphopaenia. He did not receive specific treatment for COVID-19, and fully recovered at two weeks. Neither had a severe case of COVID-19 or required hospitalisation.",
