An intriguing observation has been the near absence of children in initial disease reports, mild disease overall in child cases, no reported deaths in children aged <10 years of age and suggestions that minimally symptomatic children may facilitate disease transmission within communities. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Li et al. report three child cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection 7 ; the report is notable for at least two reasons.",

The imperative to 'do anything possible' will be felt by all paediatricians caring for children with COVID-19; however, the 'first do no harm' principle should certainly apply in all situations where the natural history of disease is poorly described or indicative of likely spontaneous recovery without any treatment. Clinicians should always balance potential risks and benefits to the individual patient with assiduous attention to infection control to protect other vulnerable patients within the health-care environment and the public at large.",
