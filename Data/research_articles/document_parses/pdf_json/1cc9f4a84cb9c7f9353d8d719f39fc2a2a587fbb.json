During replication of the RNA genome there is a high frequency of mutation and recombination, which has given rise to many strains of IBV and results in the potential for new and emerging strains. Currently the live-attenuated vaccine gives poor cross-strain immunity. Effective antiviral agents may therefore be advantageous in the treatment of IBV. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is a potent inhibitor of the DNA virus herpes simplex virus but not RNA viruses. The effect of LiCl on the replication of IBV was examined in cell culture using two model cell types; Vero cells, an African Green monkey kidney-derived epithelial cell line; and DF-1 cells, an immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast cell line. When treated with a range of LiCl concentrations, IBV RNA and protein levels and viral progeny production were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in both cell types, and the data indicated that inhibition was a cellular rather than a virucidal effect. Host cell protein synthesis still took place in LiCl-treated cells and the level of a standard cellular housekeeping protein remained unchanged, indicating that the effect of LiCl was specifically against IBV.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Coronaviruses are a family of positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells.

One possibility is that the activity of components of the IBV-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases may be affected by LiCl.

The data indicated that in both Vero and DF-1 cells treated with LiCl, there was an overall reduction in viral RNA levels as the concentration of LiCl was increased (Figure 5a ,b, respectively). For example, there was an approximately 20-fold decrease in subgenomic mRNA levels between untreated cells and those treated with 5 mM LiCl in Vero and DF-1 cells (each 40 \u00c1 Ct value represents a two-fold difference). The RNA levels indicated that the amount of genomic RNA decreased and was not significantly different between 5 and 50 mM LiCl treatment. However, the total positive-sense RNA (subgenomic and genomic) in DF-1 cells generally decreased in a dose-dependent manner (except not between 5 and 10 mM LiCl) as the concentration of LiCl was increased. This may account for the general reduction in the amount of N protein observed in infected cells treated with increasing concentrations of LiCl. These data suggest the potential use of LiCl as an antiviral agent against IBV and, by inference, in terms of having common genome and replication strategies, other coronaviruses. Whether or not LiCl could be used in the field against IBV remains to be determined, but certainly it would have application in the laboratory for studying the molecular biology of IBV.

Actualmente las vacunas vivas atenuadas producen una inmunidad cruzada pobre. Por lo tanto, mol\u00e9culas antiv\u00edricas efectivas podr\u00edan ser ventajosas en el tratamiento de IBV. El cloruro de litio (LiCl) es un potente inhibidor del virus herpes simple DNA pero no de virus RNA. Se estudi\u00f3 el efecto del LiCl en la replicaci\u00f3 n de IBV en dos tipos de cultivos celulares: c\u00e9lulas Vero, una l\u00ednea celular epitelial derivada de ri\u00f1 \u00f3 n de mono Verde Africano, y c\u00e9lulas DF-1, una l\u00ednea celular de fibroblastos de pollo inmortalizados. Cuando se trataron con un rango de concentraciones de LiCl, los niveles de prote\u00ednas y RNA de IBV y la producci\u00f3 n de progenie se redujeron de manera dosis-dependiente en ambos tipos celulares, y los datos indicaron que la fue una inhibici\u00f3n m\u00e1s de tipo celular que un efecto viricida. La s\u00edntesis de prote\u00ednas celulares todav\u00eda tuvo lugar en las c\u00e9lulas tratadas con LiCl y el nivel de una prote\u00edna constitutiva est\u00e1ndar se mantuvo, indicando que el efecto del LiCl era espec\u00edfico frente a IBV.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 547, "end": 557, "text": "(Figure 5a", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results and Discussion"}],

Les agents antiviraux efficaces peuvent alors \u00eatre avantageux dans le traitement de l'IBV. Le chlorure de lithium (LiCl) est un inhibiteur puissant de l'herpesvirus simplex, virus \u00e0 ADN, mais pas des virus \u00e0 ARN. L'effet du LiCl sur la r\u00e9plication de l'IBV a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 en culture cellulaire en utilisant deux mod\u00e8les de type cellulaire, les cellules Vero, une lign\u00e9e cellulaire \u00e9pith\u00e9liale d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de rein de singe vert africain, et des cellules DF-1, une lign\u00e9e cellulaire immortalis\u00e9e de fibroblastes d'embryon de poulet. Lors du traitement avec diff\u00e9rentes concentrations de LiCl, l'ARN de l'IBV, le taux de prot\u00e9ines et la production de virus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 diminu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on dose-d\u00e9pendante pour les deux types de cellule et les donn\u00e9es ont montr\u00e9 que l'inhibition \u00e9tait un effet cellulaire plut\u00f4 t qu'un effet virucide. La synth\u00e8se des prot\u00e9ines de la cellule h\u00f4te avait toujours bien lieu dans les cellules trait\u00e9es au LiCl et le niveau d'une prot\u00e9ine ''de m\u00e9nage'' utilis\u00e9e comme t\u00e9moin d'expression cellulaire est rest\u00e9 inchang\u00e9, indiquant que l'effet du LiCl \u00e9tait sp\u00e9cifiquement dirig\u00e9 contre l'IBV.Lithiumchlorid inhibiert das Coronavirus infekti\u00f6 se Bronchitis Virus in der ZellkulturDas avi\u00e4re Coronavirus infekti\u00f6 se Bronchitis Virus (IBV) ist ein \u00f6 konomisch bedeutsamer Krankheitserreger f\u00fc r das Wirtschaftsgefl\u00fc gel, der trotz Vakzination Mortalit\u00e4t und Produktionseinbu\u00dfen verursacht. W\u00e4hrend der Replikation des RNS-Genoms kommt es h\u00e4ufig zu Mutationen und Rekombinationen, die eine Vielzahl von IBV-St\u00e4mmen entstehen lie\u00dfen und die ein Potential f\u00fc r neu entstehende St\u00e4mme sind. Die gegenw\u00e4rtig eingesetzten Lebendvakzinen geben gegen diese neuen St\u00e4mme nur eine geringe Kreuzimmunit\u00e4t. Aus diesem Grund w\u00e4ren wirksame antivirale Agentien von gro\u00dfem Vorteil f\u00fc r die Bek\u00e4mpfung des IBV. Lithiumchlorid (LiCl) ist ein potenter Inhibitor des DNS-Virus Herpes simplex-Virus, aber nicht von RNS-Viren. Der Effekt von LiCl auf die IBV-Replikation wurde in der Zellkultur unter Verwendung von zwei Zelltypvarianten untersucht: Verozellen, eine von der Niere einer afrikanischen Gr\u00fc nen Meerkatze abstammenden Epithelzelllinie, sowie DF-1-Zellen, eine immortalisierte H\u00fc hnerembryofibroblastenzelllinie. Durch die Behandlung mit verschiedenen LiCl-Konzentrationen wurden die IBV-RNS und \u00c1Proteingehalte und die Virusvermehrung in beiden Zelltypen dosisabh\u00e4ngig reduziert. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass die Inhibition eher ein zellul\u00e4rer als eine viruzider Effekt war. Die Proteinsynthese in der Wirtszelle fand in den LiCl-behandelten Zellen weiter statt und der Gehalt eines zellul\u00e4ren Standard-Organisationsproteins blieb unver\u00e4ndert, was darauf hin weist, dass der Effekt des LiCl spezifisch gegen das IBV gerichtet ist.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "This work was funded by the award of a BBSRC DTA/ CASE studentship with Intervet UK, Ltd to J.A.H.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Acknowledgement"}]}
