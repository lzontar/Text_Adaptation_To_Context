This study analyzed the genetic characteristics of the spike (S) gene of 33 FCoVs circulating in Northern Italy between 2011 and 2015 in cats with or without FIP. In order to reconstruct the most probable places of origin and dispersion of FCoV among Italian cats, a phylogeographic approach was performed based on 106 FCoV S gene partial sequences from cats, including the 33 novel Italian sequences and 73 retrieved from public databases. Only FCoV type I J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was found in the Italian cats. The estimated mean evolutionary rate of FCoV was 2.4 x 10 -2 subs/site/year (95% HPD: 1.3-3.7 x10 -2 ), confirming the high genetic variability in the circulating strains. All the isolates clustered in a unique highly significant clade that likely originated from USA between the 1950s and the 1970s, confirming the first descriptions of the disease in American cats. Our results suggest that from USA the virus likely entered Germany and thereafter spread to other European countries. Phylogeography showed that sequences segregated mainly by geographical origin. In the 2010s Italian sequences clustered in different subclades, confirming that different strains cocirculate in Italy. Further studies on archival samples and other genetic regions of FCoV are suggested in order to confirm the present results and to reconstruct a more in-depth detailed virus dispersion pattern for the definition of possible control measures.

These two biotypes exist in both types I and II (Tekes and Thiel, 2016; Jaimes et al., 2020) . Like other RNA viruses, coronaviruses are prone to mutations. Few mutations in accessory genes and the spike (S) gene of FCoVs have been identified. The mutations M1058L or S1060A in the S gene, that were initially thought to be a marker for FIPV, were recently associated to the ability of the virus to infect and replicate in monocytes and macrophages, representing a marker for systemic FCoV replication (Chang et al., 2012 , Pedersen, 2014 Porter et al., 2014; Stranieri et al., 2018; Felten and Hartmann, 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 302, "end": 318, "text": "(Pedersen, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 369, "end": 392, "text": "(Tekes and Thiel, 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 393, "end": 413, "text": "Jaimes et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 823, "end": 842, "text": "(Chang et al., 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 843, "end": 859, "text": ", Pedersen, 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 860, "end": 880, "text": "Porter et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 881, "end": 904, "text": "Stranieri et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 905, "end": 931, "text": "Felten and Hartmann, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The S gene is also used for FCoV typing.

Moreover, because the S gene encodes for the spike protein, which is the protein most subject to evolutionary immune pressure, it is the most variable of the FCoV genes.

The range of FCoV origin date that was estimated by our analysis is also confirmed by a previous study indicating that FCoV is estimated to have diverged from alphacoronavirues in 1953 (Vijaykrishna et al., 2007) The significant migration link that was observed by our phylogeographical reconstruction between the US and Germany during 1974-1995 is in agreement with the information on the first reports of FIP in Germany years after the US (Landes et al., 1984) and suggests that the virus likely moved from the US to Europe where it reached Germany. Evidence of North America being the source of introduction of FCoV in other countries has also been recently reported in Brazil (Myrrha et al., 2019) . FCoV introduction in countries is likely by animal movements. It has been reported that major geographical movements of viruses that need direct contact for viral transmission mirrors those of animals and that key migratory or transport routes followed by host species could also be responsible for virus transmission in areas where the virus was previously absent (Chen et al., 2015) . Indeed, FCoV transmission occurs by the fecal-oral route and requires the presence of FECV-infected cats shedding the virus in their feces (Addie et al., 2003) . In the case of FCoV, animal movements between USA and Europe may have been linked to cat shows, that started in 1871 in UK and have been reported worldwide thereafter (Hornidge, 2002) or to animal movements for breeding purposes. It has to be kept in mind that during the Second World War cat breeds from Europe were almost extinct (Bell et al., 2012) and that after the end of the war cats were frequently introduced from the US, where American cat breeders had continued to develop cat breeds (Longeri M., personal communication). Moreover, cats movement may also have been linked to owners' movements. During the Cold War, thousands of American soldiers and their families were moved to Germany (Alvah, 2007) and it is likely that cats followed their owners. Indeed, air flight companies specialized in pet shipping have reported in their websites that at least from the early days of 1968 pets were flown between the US and Germany (Lauzi S., personal communication). However, further investigations are needed to confirm this hypothesis that may also account for the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f introduction of FCoV-infected cats by American owners in other countries where US personnel and families stationed for prolonged periods after the Second World War, like Japan.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 298, "end": 315, "text": "(Holzworth, 1963)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 503, "end": 530, "text": "(Vijaykrishna et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 759, "end": 780, "text": "(Landes et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1019, "text": "(Myrrha et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1406, "text": "(Chen et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1568, "text": "(Addie et al., 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1754, "text": "(Hornidge, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1903, "end": 1922, "text": "(Bell et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2269, "end": 2282, "text": "(Alvah, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our result indicating Germany being the first European country in which FIP was introduced is also suggested by the first description of the disease from samples collected in cats from this country (Landes et al., 1984) , compared to other European countries where FIP was reported one or few years after Germany. The presence in our phylogeographic analysis of Germany being the most probable origin of the first European subclade with sequences from Germany and from the Netherlands suggests that FCoV type I may have initially spread between these two bordering countries and afterwards to other European countries, including Italy. Cat movements between European countries may have been associated with owner's movements, with imports of purebred cats for breeding purposes or by participation in cat shows.

It cannot be ruled out that pre-existing avirulent feline coronaviruses may have been previously circulating in Europe in healthy cats. These strains may have been undiagnosed because they were less prone to undergo biotype conversion and cause FIP and/or because risk factors associated to the outcome of the disease (Addie et al., 2009) were less present in European countries compared to the US. Indeed, the shift in the status of cats as pets after World War II, with number of pet cats greatly increased, has been identified as one of the principal factor for FCoV infection (Pedersen, 2009 ). Moreover, it is not possible to establish if the available sequences from the databases truly reflected geographic distribution of the virus. It is also possible that available FCoV sequences simply reflected the countries with laboratories that first started sequencing because of their scientific interest in FCoV studies.
