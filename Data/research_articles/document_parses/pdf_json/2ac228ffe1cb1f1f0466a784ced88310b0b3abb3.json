            "text": "Hyperinflammation and uncontrolled cytokine release, which can be seen in severe cases of COVID-19, require therapy to reduce the innate immune response without hindering necessary adaptive immune mechanisms. Here, we show results from the first in-human trials using noninvasive ultrasound stimulation of the spleen to reduce cytokine release in the context of both an acute response in healthy subjects and a chronic inflammatory condition in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Splenic ultrasound results in a reduction in TNF serum levels, as well as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 transcript levels in monocytes. There is also a down regulation of pathways involved in TNF and IL-6 production, and IFN\u03b3-and NF\u03baB-regulated genes. Many of these cytokines or pathways are upregulated in COVID-19 patients. There is also a reduction in chemokine transcript levels and other components of the chemotactic response, suggesting that reduction of cellular migration may contribute to the therapeutic effects of ultrasound. There is no inhibition of the adaptive immune response with ultrasound treatment relating to antibody production. This is consistent with a pre-clinical animal model where enhanced antibody production was achieved with splenic ultrasound. Therefore, this new splenic ultrasound approach has the potential to treat acute and chronic hyper-inflammatory diseases, as it lowers cytokine levels without disrupting the normal adaptive immune response. Portable ultrasound technologies are currently being developed and translated to the clinic to treat various inflammatory disorders, with more recent efforts directed towards combatting the hyperinflammation or 'cytokine storm' in COVID-19 patients.",

Inflammatory reactions are typical in response to microbial or viral infection but can lead to health problems or life-threatening conditions if there is a persistent hyperactive innate immune response, involving cytokine toxicity and tissue damage (2, 3) . A recent and devastating example is the hyperinflammation caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral infection). It is estimated that 17% of COVID-19 cases experience a 'cytokine storm' that leads to severe or fatal respiratory disease, known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (4) (5) (6) . In addition to other acute conditions, such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (7, 8) , hyperinflammation is an issue that occurs across multiple chronic inflammatory systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and irritable bowel syndrome (9, 10) . The current pharmacologic approaches to treating hyperinflammation are associated with multiple side effects and high costs.",

Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve activates the splenic nerve and cells within the spleen, leading to activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (14, 15) . This pathway depends on splenic nerve release of norepinephrine that activates acetyltransferase -expressing T lymphocytes, which in turn modulates innate immune cells to decrease systemic levels of key proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-15 and TNF (16, 17) . Furthermore, electrical vagus nerve stimulation has been shown in mice and humans to provide therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects for chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g., RA and irritable bowel syndrome) and for acute inflammation (e.g., sepsis, renal ischemia, trauma/hemorrhagic shock, and acute lung injury following trauma/hemorrhagic shock; (16, (18) (19) (20) (21) .",

Several groups have pursued non-invasive ultrasound stimulation of the spleen as a safer, non-surgical approach for modulating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Since the vagus nerve projects to the brain and multiple organs throughout the body (22) , targeting neurons or cells specifically within the spleen can reduce unintended activation or side effects. There has been a recent surge of research which demonstrates the ability to activate or modulate cells with ultrasound energy (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) There are several studies in rodents showing the ability to modulate the splenic nerve or immune cells within the spleen with ultrasound, to reduce inflammation and cytokine levels (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) . One of the initial reports was in a mouse model of reperfusion injury and kidney inflammation, where ultrasound stimulation of the spleen significantly reduced kidney damage (29, 34) . Recently, our research groups discovered that specific parameters of ultrasound stimulation of the spleen can drive significant anti-inflammatory effects in rodent models of both chronic inflammation (inflammatory arthritis) and acute inflammation (sepsis) (31, 32) , which was shown to be mediated through a similar cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway accessed through vagus nerve stimulation. Ultrasound is a potentially impactful clinical solution to inflammation as it can be applied non-invasively to the body with a wearable device and with energy parameters already shown to be safe for the human body based on numerous ultrasound imaging applications (35, 36) .",

In healthy individuals, a single three-minute administration of splenic ultrasound stimulation significantly inhibits whole blood TNF production upon ex vivo exposure to endotoxin compared to sham controls. In RA patients, we observed that daily splenic ultrasound stimulation results in reduction of blood-borne transcripts encoding for pro-inflammatory markers IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and NF\u03baB, as well as suppresses pathways involved in IL-6 and TNF production. Ultrasound also reduces pathways involved with monocyte migration, contributing to its anti-inflammatory effect. From a safety perspective, circulating immune cell composition does not change with ultrasound treatment, and ultrasound does not inhibit the adaptive immune response in humans. Our additional pre-clinical animal data further demonstrates that in addition to dampening cytokine output and circulating monocyte invasiveness, prophylactic ultrasound activation of the splenic neuroimmune pathway results in enhanced antibody response upon exposure to an inflammatory antigen. Thus, activation of the splenic neuroimmune pathway may provide a low risk therapeutic approach for a broad range of health conditions, due to its pleotropic nature and physiological role in suppressing specific cytokines involved in innate immunity while enhancing the transition to and maintenance of the adaptive immune response (18, 37, 38) . Together, these data suggest great potential for splenic ultrasound as a low-risk clinical therapy for a range of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases without requiring surgery or intake of artificial substances with possible side effects.",

Drug based suppression of these cytokines for tissue protection comes with the risk of inhibiting viral clearance or increasing susceptibility to bacterial co-infections (39, 40) . Non-invasive ultrasound activation of the splenic neuroimmune pathway may provide an alternative method to combat the cytokine storm without compromising the adaptive immune response in COVID-19 patients, ultimately reducing the high mortality and morbidity rates confronting this worldwide pandemic that currently has limited treatment options.",

An ultrasonographer first identified and targeted the hilum of the spleen, then delivered the pulsed ultrasound stimulus using a modified elastography software setting in the system. Sham stimulation control subjects underwent the same procedure as the stimulated group, including transducer placement and movement of the ultrasound probe to the proper splenic location trajectory, but with no ultrasound energy being transmitted to the spleen from the transducer. Since healthy subjects have low serum TNF levels, we revealed changes in inflammatory status using whole blood challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ex vivo. This ex vivo cytokine production assay has been previously used to verify splenic neuroimmune activation using implanted vagus nerve stimulators and is a well-established method for non-invasively assessing activation of neuroimmune pathways (18, (41) (42) (43) . A reduction in LPS-induced TNF production in blood sampled from ultrasound stimulated subjects was tested at multiple LPS concentrations (Fig. 1A ) and significant reduction is observed when comparing the ultrasound stimulated group to the non-stimulated controls ( Fig. 1B ; p-value = 0.006 using Wilcoxon unpaired rank-sum test) at the optimal LPS concentration (1 ng/mL; Fig.1A ). These data are consistent with earlier reports using implanted nerve stimulators or pharmaceutical activators of the splenic pathway (18, 42) . They are also consistent with the magnitude of TNF reduction using similar ultrasound stimulation parameters in a previous study activating the neuroimmune pathway in a rodent model of endotoxemia (31) . Further supporting the human results, we also demonstrated that splenic ultrasound stimulation in a rodent model achieves a reduction across a number of proinflammatory cytokines beyond TNF, including IL-6, IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b1, and IL-12 in splenic lysates (Fig. S1 ), which is consistent with previous reports using implanted vagus nerve stimulators (18, 44) . TNF response after LPS incubation is shown for one ultrasound stimulated subject from samples collected before (0 hours baseline) and after (2 hours post stimulation) ultrasound application. The optimal dose of LPS for measuring the immunomodulatory response to ultrasound was found to be at 1 ng/mL, and this is used for comparing the TNF response between the ultrasound stimulated versus control groups. B) Ultrasound stimulation of the spleen decreases whole-blood LPS-induced TNF release, where blood was obtained from 18 healthy human subjects prior to and then two hours following splenic ultrasound application (stimulated: n=9, control: n=9). The data shown were taken from the 1 ng/ml LPS concentration for each dose response curve for all subjects and samples. p-value was computed using the unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.",

Expanding upon the findings in healthy human subjects in the previous section, we initiated a controlled, randomized clinical trial of splenic ultrasound treatment in RA patients (clinical study described at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03690466). Participants received ultrasound stimulation to the spleen with the goal of lowering the over-active inflammatory response that occurs during RA flare-ups. Up to 20 RA patients are to be recruited into the study (enrollment is ongoing). Due to the urgency of identifying treatment options for this COVID-19 pandemic, data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that has been collected thus far in five ultrasound-treated patients have been analyzed ahead of completion of the study for inclusion into this paper. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood taken from each research participant before ultrasound treatment (day 0, pre-stimulation) and after two weeks of daily 30-minute sessions of ultrasound to the spleen (day 14, post-stimulation). From these 10 samples (subjects = 5, timepoints = 2), a total of 53,343 PBMCs were successfully sequenced from single cells (Table  S1 ). In silico analysis identified 13 cell-types based on gene expression patterns of standardly used marker genes (Fig. S2 ). Participants received stimulation with a 1 MHz transducer (1.2 W/cm 2 ; SoundCare Plus, Roscoe Medical) that was moved continuously across a 5-inch by 5-inch square, centered on the spleen, as identified by an ultrasonographer. Further details on the clinical study design is presented in the Materials and Methods section.",

We observed reduced monocyte expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokine genes encoding for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 from all five subjects post-stimulation compared with pre-stimulation ( Fig. 2A , p-values given for transcripts showing significance of p<0.05). Although this result was determined by analyzing all monocytes, reduction of these two markers appears primarily in CD14+ monocytes as this is the cell type showing predominant expression of those genes (Fig. 2B) . The same analysis in CD8+ T cells show a decrease in transcripts that encode for IFN\u03b3 ( Fig. 2A ). The changes in transcript level of these cytokines can only be detected when comparing within the same cell type before and after treatment, within the cell that expresses the cytokine (Fig. S2 ). Consistent with known expression patterns of IL1B and CXCL8 transcripts (encoding for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8), we see that these transcripts are only suppressed in the monocytes where they are primarily detected. Likewise, IFNG transcripts (encoding for IFN\u03b3) are detected and found to be reduced in CD8+ T cells (Fig.  S2 ). In our dataset, other cytokines like TNF and IL-6 did not show a significant change in monocytes; however, IL-6 transcripts were detected in only 66 of the 53,343 cells. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude if there is or is not a change in transcript levels encoding IL-6 with ultrasound treatment.",

Although these gene transcripts are defined as differentially expressed when comparing monocytes from all subjects ( Fig. 2A) , we also observe that for most genes, this down-regulation is consistent across subjects ( Fig. 2C ; columns represent cell-type averages for CD14+ and CD16+ cells for each subject that are similar across columns for many of the genes). showing CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes represented by orange and green dots, respectively.

Enriched GO terms associated with cytokine production are shown, where bars represent number of significant genes in a list relative to number of genes that would be expected by chance, and with number of genes contributing to each GO term represented by the shade of blue. pvalues for each term shown is from Fisher exact test. with inflammation. The GO system of classification assigns genes (for differentially expressed gene list) into bins based on their functional characteristics. Gene sets can then be analyzed for GO terms that are statistically over-represented among that set, allowing for a better understanding of which biological processes (e.g., inflammation) may be changed with treatment. Out of the top statistically enriched GO terms for the down-regulated genes, we observe many that contribute to pro-inflammatory cellular processes. Genes suppressed by ultrasound show enrichment of GO terms including \"inflammatory response\" (p-value = 1.50 \u0395-5, Table S3 ), \"cytokine-mediated signaling pathway,\" and \"cellular response to cytokine stimulus\" (p-values = 9.7 E-5 and 6.7E-6, Fig. 3B ). We also observe enriched GO terms associated with positive regulation of TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 among the down-regulated genes, suggesting that inducing signals for TNF or IL-6 are also suppressed, despite the absences of significant change in TNF or IL-6 transcript levels (Fig.  3B ). These GO term results show that many gene transcripts encoding for cellular inflammatory functions go down after ultrasound treatment.",

IL-8 is a chemokine (chemotactic factor), which stimulates neutrophil movement towards inflammatory sites. Therefore, we further assessed if ultrasound influences other signaling molecules involved with cellular migration (e.g., to sites of inflammation). GO term analysis of down-regulated genes in CD14+ monocytes show enrichment of \"positive regulation of cell migration\" among the top 15 significantly enriched GO terms. Other GO terms, such as \"lamellipodium assembly\" (facilitates cell mobility), \"ephrin receptor signaling\" (promotes cell adhesion), and \"actin nucleation\" (involved with cell locomotion), all suggest that ultrasound treatment induces down regulation of genes involved with cell migration (Fig. 4B) . Furthermore, genes that more specifically contribute to \"monocyte chemotaxis\" are down-regulated post-ultrasound stimulation in CD14+ monocytes and many of these genes are consistently reduced across all five subjects (Fig. 4A) , even with quite variable or inhomogeneous patient characteristics (Table S2) .",

Therefore, we assessed whether non-invasive splenic ultrasound treatment suppresses the adaptive immune response or more specifically antibody production. Our transcriptomic data do not suggest a suppression of the adaptive immune response. In fact, we observe that among genes upregulated in B cells, there is an enrichment for GO terms associated with \"B cell activation\" (Fig. 6A ). Genes associated with this GO term include transcripts that encode for IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies. Interestingly, these gene transcripts are upregulated in some of the ultrasound-treated subjects (Fig. 6B) , though with greater variability in results across subjects than was observed for suppression of cytokines and chemokines in monocytes. For example, we observe that for average transcript levels across B cells, transcripts encoding IgG are only upregulated in 2 or 3 subjects (IGHG2 and IGHG4, respectively) out of the 5 subjects. Regardless of the variability across subjects, these data support that ultrasound treatment does not generally inhibit B cell activation and antibody production across patients, and can even potentially enhance antibody production; thus, ultrasound is not expected to compromise the adaptive immune response.",

We observe that splenic ultrasound stimulation prior to endotoxin exposure (three minutes daily, once a day for 3 days followed by LPS injection on the fourth day) results in a significant increase in IgM and IgG antibody production 24 hours after LPS exposure compared to sham and/or non-LPS controls (p-values listed in Fig. 6C  description) . Furthermore, this enhanced antibody output is dependent on the presence of the toxin/antigen, as there is no observed ultrasound effect on antibody production in the absence of LPS exposure. The increase in antibody transcript levels we observed in some of the human subjects, and not in the others, may be attributed to those participants also having encountered an antigen, such as a cold or other infection that was not identified during the study. This explanation is further supported by a recent report demonstrating that brain-spleen neural pathways are capable of modulating splenic plasma cells differentiation upon presentation of novel T Cell dependent antigens (45) . for na\u00efve animals (no LPS + sham), animals exposed to splenic ultrasound stimulation with no endotoxin (no LPS + ultrasound), animals exposed to the endotoxin but receiving sham stimulation (LPS + sham), and animals receiving both LPS exposure and splenic ultrasound stimulation (LPS + ultrasound).

Recent studies have revealed that COVID-19 patients consistently produce high levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-6, and TNF, which strongly suggests dysregulation in the innate immune response (34) (35) (36) (37) . More specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals exhibit significantly higher expression levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 transcripts in circulating monocytes, as well as IFN\u03b3 in CD8+ T cells, shown through PBMC single-cell RNA sequencing of COVID-19 patients (38) . Single cell RNA sequencing has further shown that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with severe COVID-19 disease have higher levels of IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 compared to patients with only moderate disease (49) . These molecules are key components of the COVID-19 cytokine storm that function in acute lung injury to recruit neutrophils to alveoli, inducing lung tissue damage (39) . Recently, SARS-CoV-2 infection in children has been associated with a novel multisystem inflammatory disease (MIS-C) resembling toxic shock syndrome or atypical Kawasaki disease (50) . Kawasaki disease also presents with elevated transcripts levels of genes encoding for IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17 (51) ; and along with ARDS, is likely to be a condition caused by the COVID-19-induced cytokine storm (52) . Clinical therapies that can suppress these pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce migration of circulating immune cells to the lungs may be capable of treating patients with moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 to calm the cytokine storm and prevent morbidity and mortality (Fig. 7A) .",

In addition to demonstrating the ability to reduce key proinflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways involved with a hyperactive innate immune response, splenic ultrasound also reduces IL-8 and many components associated with cell migration, specifically monocyte migration (Fig. 4) . These findings are consistent with previous animal studies showing that activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway suppresses monocyte migration in mice (46) . Taken together, one proposed mechanism of action for ultrasound treatment is that ultrasound modulates circulating immune cells initially within the spleen via activation of the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway, which suppresses proinflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways, as well as inhibiting cellular migration, such that there is reduced inflammation at the target site (e.g., at joints in RA or alveoli for COVID-19; Fig.  7A ). Furthermore, data in humans and preclinical animal data show an increase in antibody production with splenic ultrasound.",

Indeed, splenic ultrasound may enhance the adaptive immune system through the recently discovered brain-spleen neuroimmune pathway that enhances differentiation of antibodyproducing splenic plasma cells (SPPCs) upon antigen activation (45). One limitation of the presented results in the context of COVID-19 or a cytokine storm is that ultrasound stimulation of the spleen may not generate anti-inflammatory effects sufficient to suppress a severe infectious inflammatory response. The anti-inflammatory effects in this paper in response to splenic ultrasound were demonstrated acutely (single 3-minute stimulation) in healthy human subjects or to a moderate extent in RA patients. The question remains whether the antiinflammatory effects observed in healthy subjects or in patients with a chronic inflammation disorder, such as RA, will translate to patients harboring a systemic viral infection, as observed for COVID-19. This question will be answered through a clinical trial that is currently being set up at the University of Minnesota together with GE Research to test this ultrasound approach in COVID-19 patients funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA; Department of Defense).",

In the ongoing RA study at the University of Minnesota, a commercially available ultrasound device (SoundCare Plus) was used on patients that did not have targeting capabilities tailored for the spleen. At the onset of that RA study, SoundCare Plus was one of few devices that was already FDA regulated for various stimulation applications; thus, this unit was selected for the RA study. The GE LOGIQ E10 device can be used to better target and stimulate specific locations of the spleen, which the GE team has already demonstrated with strong anti-inflammatory effects in healthy human subjects (Fig. 1B) . Previous animal studies have also demonstrated that stronger anti-inflammatory effects are possible with better focusing of stimulation within the spleen or longer periods on a given target (31, 32) . Furthermore, sufficient activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway has been shown to combat acute and deadly cytokine storm conditions in sepsis animal models, and the magnitude of cytokine suppression provided by ultrasound is consistent with the protection provided by implant-based or pharmaceutical methods in these studies (31, 53, 54) .",

For ultrasound stimulus delivery, individuals were asked to lie in the right lateral recumbent position with their arms above their heads to expose the splenic region of the abdomen. After ultrasound gel was applied to the region, the ultrasound probe was placed on the participant's abdomen. This procedure was performed for both the sham control group (n=9) and ultrasound stimulated group (n=9).

Stimulation was performed using a modified elastography setting on the LOGIQ E9 operated in two modes: an imaging/targeting mode with short ultrasound pulses (on the order of 1 microsecond) and relatively low acoustic power levels (on the order of 10 mW/cm 2 ), and a stimulation mode (from the clinical shear wave elastography setting) using longer ultrasound pulses (on the order of 1 ms) and higher acoustic power levels (290.4 mW/cm 2 ). Stimulation was performed in twelve 15-second long epochs separated by 15 seconds each, and a total stimulation duration of 3 minutes. The 15 second epochs were performed during breath holds, during which an ultrasonographer was holding the probe in position above the spleen. Before each stimulation period, the ultrasonographer checked the location of the probe using the imaging mode to ensure that all stimulation pulses were on target. The focal landmark used for targeting and stimulation was the hilum of the spleen in the group included in the presented analysis. For the sham control group, the movements and probe contact for the ultrasound procedure were performed by the ultrasonographer, and the total duration of the procedure remained the same as the stimulated group, except that no ultrasound power was applied (i.e., ultrasound output via the probe was turned off).

Minor flexibility was allowed for scheduling clinic visits outside of holidays for special circumstances. On the first visit, the spleen was imaged by an ultrasonographer and the center of the spleen trajectory was marked on the participant's skin. Participants were instructed on how to self-administer ultrasound treatment to the spleen. The procedure involved sweeping the ultrasound wand continuously across a 5-inch by 5-inch square centered on the spleen mark placed by the ultrasonographer and ensuring full contact was made with the skin during the daily 30 minute stimulation period. Researchers were able to visually confirm that daily treatments were administered through daily online video sessions with the patients. These video sessions took place at about the same time each day for the 14-day treatment period. With each inclinic visit, participants received a joint examination, peripheral joint ultrasound, and blood draw, as well as completing several physical evaluations and questionnaires. Full study details including analysis of all patients and assessments will be presented in a future publication.",

A HIFU transducer and system was then positioned on the target area, and a separate ultrasound scan performed using a smaller probe (3S, GE) that was placed within the opening of the HIFU transducer was used to verify alignment of the ultrasound beam with the spleen. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats that were 8-12 weeks old (250-300 g; Charles River Labs) were housed at 25 degrees Celsius on a 12-h light/dark cycle and acclimatized for 1 week, with handling before experiments to minimize the potential confounding measures due to stress response. Water and regular rodent chow were available ad libitum. LPS (0111:B4, Sigma Aldrich) was used to produce a significant state of inflammation in the na\u00efve adult rodents. LPS was administered to animals in the amount of 10 mg/kg, which corresponds to a LD75 dose via intraperitoneal injection.",

For ultrasound stimulation, animals were anesthetized with 2-4% isoflurane, and the animals were laid on a water circulating warming pad to prevent hyperthermia during the procedures.

Ultrasound was applied to the designated area above the spleen using the probe and system described and calibrated from a previous study (31) . An ultrasound stimulus using the previously found optimal stimulation parameters (1.1 MHz, 0.5 ms pulse repetition frequency, 136.36 microsecond pulse length, 568 mW/cm 2 ISPTA) was then applied for 2 minutes, and LPS was immediately injected post-stimulation. Animals were allowed to incubate under anesthesia for one hour, and after incubation the animal was euthanized, and tissue and blood samples were collected. For experiments testing antibody production, an ultrasound stimulus was applied daily (in the morning) for three days prior to LPS injection. On the fourth day, following the three consecutive treatment days, LPS (10mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally. The animals were then incubated for 60 minutes in accordance with previous studies, and tissue and blood were harvested for analysis of cytokines and antibody production.",
