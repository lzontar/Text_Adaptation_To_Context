The rate of genome generation is unprecedented, yet there is currently no coherent nor accepted scheme for naming the expanding phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. We present a rational and dynamic virus nomenclature that uses a phylogenetic framework to identify those lineages that contribute most to active spread. Our system is made tractable by constraining the number and depth of hierarchical lineage labels and by flagging and declassifying virus lineages that become unobserved and hence are likely inactive. By focusing on active virus lineages and those spreading to new locations this nomenclature will assist in tracking and understanding the patterns and determinants of the global spread of SARS-CoV-2.",

These genomes have the potential to provide invaluable insights into the ongoing evolution and epidemiology of the virus during the global pandemic and will likely play an important role in its eventual mitigation and control. Despite such a wealth of data, there is currently no coherent system for naming and discussing the growing number of phylogenetic lineages that comprise the population diversity of this virus, with conflicting ad hoc and informal systems of virus nomenclature in circulation. A nomenclature system is urgently required before scientific literature and communication become further confused.",

Typically, genetic diversity is categorised into distinct 'clades', each of which corresponds to a monophyletic group on a phylogenetic tree. These clades may be referred to by a variety of terms, such as 'subtypes', 'genotypes', 'groups', depending on the taxonomic level under investigation or the established scientific literature for the virus in question. The clades usually reflect an attempt to divide pathogen phylogeny and genetic diversity into a set of groupings that are approximately equally divergent, mutually exclusive and statistically well supported. All genome sequences are therefore allocated to one clade or provisionally labelled as unclassified. Often multiple hierarchical levels of classification exist for the same pathogens, such as the terms 'type', 'group' and 'subtype' that are used in the field of HIV research.",

In contrast, some rapidly evolving viruses such as influenza A are characterised by high rates of lineage turnover, so that the genetic diversity circulating in any particular year largely emerges out of and replaces the diversity present in the preceding few years. For human seasonal influenza, this behaviour is the result of strong natural selection among competing lineages. In such circumstances a more explicitly phylogenetic classification system is used; for example, avian influenza viruses are classified into 'subtypes', 'clades' and 'higher order clades' according to several quantitative criteria (WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution Working Group 2012). Such a system can provide a convenient way to refer to the emergence of new (and potentially antigenically distinct) variants and is suitable for the process of selecting the component viruses for the regularly updated influenza vaccine. A similar approach to tracking antigenic diversity may be needed to inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design efforts. While useful, we recognise that dynamic nomenclature systems based on genetic distance thresholds have the potential to over-accumulate cumbersome lineage names.",

The nomenclature system is not intended to represent every evolutionary change in SARS-CoV-2, as these will number many thousand by the end of the pandemic. Instead, the focus is on genetic changes associated with important epidemiological and biological events. Fortunately, because of the early sampling and genome sequencing of COVID-19 cases in China, especially in Hubei province, it appears that the \"root sequence\" of SARS-CoV-2 is known. Many of the genomes from the earliest sampled cases are genetically identical and hence also likely identical to the most recent common ancestor of all sampled viruses. This occurrence is different to previous viruses and epidemics and provides some advantages for the development of a rational and scalable classification scheme. Specifically, setting the \"reference sequence\" to be the \"root sequence\" forms a natural starting point, as direct comparisons in the number and position of mutations can be made with respect to the root sequence.",

Hence, rather than naming every new possible lineage, classification should focus on those that have exhibited onward spread in the population, particularly those that have seeded an epidemic in a new location. For example, the large epidemic in Lombardy, northern Italy, thought to have begun in early February (Zehender et al. 2020) , has since been disseminated to other locations in northern Europe and elsewhere.",

As noted above, when SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is low during the early pandemic period, there will be a direct association between lineage assignation and the presence of particular sets of mutations (with respect to the root sequence). This should help with the development of algorithmic genome labelling approaches. This task will become more complex, but still tractable, as SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity accumulates, increasing the chance of both homoplasies and reverse mutations.

We trimmed the 5' and 3' untranslated regions and retained those genomes with at least 95% coverage of the reference genome (Wuhan-Hu-2019, GenBank accession MN908947). We aligned these sequences using MAFFT's FFT-NS-2 algorithm and default parameter settings (Katoh et al. 2002) . We then estimated a maximum likelihood tree using IQ-TREE 2 (Minh et al. 2020 ) using the GTR+G model of nucleotide substitution (Tavar\u00e9 1986; Yang 1994) , default heuristic search options, and ultrafast bootstrapping with 1000 replicates (Minh, Nguyen, and von Haeseler 2013) .",

            "text": "A and B. The earliest lineage A viruses, such as Wuhan/WH04/2020 (EPI_ISL_406801), sampled on 2020-01-05, share two nucleotides (positions 8782 in ORF1ab and 28144 in ORF8) with the closest known bat virus (RaTG13). Different nucleotides are present at those sites in viruses assigned to lineage B, of which Wuhan-Hu-1 (Genbank accession MN908947) sampled on 2019-12-26 is an early representative. Hence, although viruses from lineage B were sequenced and published first (Wu et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020), it is likely (based on current data) that lineage A viruses form the root of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic phylogeny. At the time of writing, viruses from both lineages A and B are still circulating in many countries around the world, reflecting the exportation of viruses from Hubei to other regions of China and elsewhere before the strict travel restrictions and quarantine measures were imposed there. To add further lineage designations we downloaded 2685 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID database (Shu and McCauley 2017) on 1st of April, 2020 and estimated a maximum likelihood tree for these data (see Methods) (Figure 1). Following the criteria outlined above, the tree root was placed on the branch between lineages A and B. We then defined further SARS-CoV-2 lineages, each of which descends from either lineage A or B and is assigned a numerical value (e.g. lineage A.1, or lineage B.2). Lineage designations were made using the following set of conditions: I. Each descendent lineage should show phylogenetic evidence of emergence from an ancestral lineage into another geographically distinct population, implying substantial onward transmission in that population. In the case of a rapidly expanding global lineage the recipient \"population\" may comprise multiple countries. In the case of large and populous countries it may represent a new region or province. To show phylogenetic evidence a new lineage must meet all of the following criteria: (a) it exhibits one or more shared nucleotide differences from the ancestral lineage, (b) it comprises at least 5 genomes with >95% of the genome sequenced, (c) genomes within the lineage exhibit at least one shared nucleotide change among them, and (d) a bootstrap value >70% for the lineage defining node. Importantly, criterion (c) helps to focus attention only on lineages with evidence of on-going transmission. II. The lineages identified in step (I) can themselves act as ancestors for virus lineages that then emerge in other geographic areas or at later times, provided they satisfy criteria a-d above. This results in a new lineage designation (e.g. A.1.1).",
