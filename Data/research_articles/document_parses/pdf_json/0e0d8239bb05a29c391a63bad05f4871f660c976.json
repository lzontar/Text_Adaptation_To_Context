            "text": "To examine the potential roles of melatonin in Cd uptake, accumulation and detoxification in Malus plants, we exposed two different apple rootstocks varying greatly in Cd uptake and 2 accumulation to either 0 or 30 \u03bcM Cd together with 0 or 100 \u03bcM melatonin. Cd stress stimulated endogenous melatonin production to a greater extent in the Cd-tolerant M. baccata than in the Cd-susceptible M. micromalus \"qingzhoulinqin\". Melatonin application attenuated Cd-induced reductions in growth, photosynthesis, and enzyme activity, as well as ROS and MDA accumulation. Melatonin treatment more effectively restored photosynthesis, photosynthetic pigments, and biomass in Cd-challenged M. micromalus \"qingzhoulinqin\" than in Cd-stressed M. baccata. Exogenous melatonin lowered root Cd 2+ uptake, reduced leaf Cd accumulation, decreased Cd translocation factors (T f s), and increased root, stem, and leaf melatonin contents in both Cd-exposed rootstocks. Melatonin application increased both antioxidant concentrations and enzyme activities to scavenge Cd-induced ROS. Exogenous melatonin treatment altered the mRNA levels of several genes regulating Cd uptake, transport, and detoxification including HA7, NRAMP1, NRAMP3, HMA4, PCR2, NAS1, MT2, ABCC1, and MHX. Taken together, these results suggest that exogenous melatonin reduced aerial parts Cd accumulation and mitigated Cd toxicity in Malus plants, probably due to the melatonin-mediated Cd allocation in tissues, and induction of antioxidant defense system and transcriptionally regulated key genes involved in detoxification.",

It accumulates in orchard soils via the application of metal-based pesticides, fungicides, and fertilizers and wastewater irrigation (Pizzol et al. 2014 , Duan et al. 2016 , Sungur 2016 ). According to a recent survey, the Cd levels in 55% and 66% of the soil samples from 91 orchards exceeded the Cd safety standard before flowering and after harvesting, respectively (Fang and Zhu 2014) . Cd is highly mobile and readily absorbed by plants (Luo et al. 2016) . It negatively affects plant metabolism, causes various morphological, physiological, biochemical, and 3 cellular changes, and hampers plant growth (Clemens et al. 2013) . Apple trees may accumulate toxic Cd levels (Fang and Zhu 2014, Sungur 2016) . Cd accumulation in edible plant parts poses a serious threat to human and animal health, as Cd toxicity may cause various human and animal diseases (Nawrot et al. 2006) . Therefore, reliable methods are needed to reduce Cd accumulation in the aerial organs of apple trees and other crops.",

A previous study reported that melatonin might regulate plant growth and development (Tan et al. 2012 ). Our results indicated that exogenous melatonin enhanced the photosynthetic rates, increased the chlorophyll levels and biomass, and reduced the ROS and MDA levels in various tissues of both apple rootstocks subjected to Cd stress. However, these beneficial effects were particularly strong in M. micromalus \"qingzhoulinqin\". Thus, exogenous melatonin alleviated the toxic effects of Cd in these plants, which aligns with previous reports , Ni et al. 2018 . Under Cd exposure conditions, more endogenous melatonin was found in the roots and leaves of M. baccata than in those of M. micromalus \"qingzhoulinqin\" ( Figure 5 ). Therefore, the former produced sufficient melatonin to contend with Cd-induced oxidative stress. This response is consistent with its relatively high Cd tolerance and comparatively low loss of photosynthetic pigments and biomass in response to Cd stress. However, exogenous melatonin enhanced endogenous melatonin concentrations and alleviated Cd-induced toxicity in all tissues of both apple rootstocks but especially in M. micromalus \"qingzhoulinqin\".

Melatonin treatment inhibited Cd-induced MDA accumulation in all tissues of both apple rootstocks except for M. micromalus \"qingzhoulinqin\" roots (Figure 6). The Cd-induced burst in ROS production stimulated antioxidant responses in all tissues 14 of both tree species (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). The concentrations of non-enzymatic antioxidants such as free proline, soluble phenolics, T-SH, and ASC were significantly higher in all tissues of Cd-treated plants than in those of untreated ones (Supplementary Figure S1). Melatonin application sometimes enhanced the Cd-induced increases in the levels of the aforementioned antioxidants (Supplementary Figure S1). The activities of the antioxidant enzymes such as CAT (roots and leaves), POD (stems and leaves), APX (roots), and GR (roots and leaves) were consistently higher in M. baccata than in M. micromalus \"qingzhoulinqin\" for all Cd and melatonin treatments (Supplementary Figure S2). Exogenous melatonin enhanced the Cd-induced antioxidant enzymatic activity in all tissues except for GR in M. micromalus \"qingzhoulinqin\" stems (Supplementary Figure S2). PCA was conducted on non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants to evaluate Cd detoxification patterns in the apple rootstock tissues and to establish whether exogenous melatonin mediated these trends (Figure 7, Supplementary Tables S3-S4). There were clear and distinct response patterns to Cd stress and exogenous melatonin between two apple rootstocks (Figure 7). For M. baccata, PC1 separated the effects of Cd treatment and accounted for 66% of the observed variance (Figure 7a). The concentrations of proline in the roots, stems and leaves, the T-SH and ASC concentrations in the leaves, and the POD activity in the roots , stems and leaves, the GR activity in the stems and leaves were the main positive contributors to PC1 (Supplementary",
