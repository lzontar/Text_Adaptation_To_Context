This task may be easy for a botanist who has strong knowledge about trees. However, a novice or a lover of the trees universe may have difficulties. This paper is part of the ReVeRiES project that seeks to develop a mobile application that recognizes tree species without needing an internet connection. Indeed, the application will be used in nature, forests, mountains where an internet connection is not available. In the context of tree species recognition, we treat a real problem since the photos of leaves are taken in the natural environment. The processing of this type of data is complicated because of their specificities due firstly to the nature of the objects to be recognized (inter-species similarity and intra-species variability) and secondly to the environment. Errors can be accumulated during the pre-fusion process. The merit of the fusion is to take into account all the imperfections that can taint the available data and try to model them well. The fusion is more effective if the data are well modeled. The theory of belief functions represents one of the best theoretical frameworks able to manage and represent uncertainty, inaccuracy, conflict, etc. This theory is important because of its wealth of tools to manage the various sources of imperfections as well as the specificities of the available data. In the framework of this theory, it is possible to model the data through the construction of mass functions. It is also possible to manage the computational complexity thanks to the approximations allowing to reduce the number of focal elements. Conflict being one of the most present sources of imperfections, can be dealt through the selection of the best combination rule. By merging sources of information with different degrees of reliability, the least reliable source may affect the data issued from the most reliable one. One of the solutions for this problem is to try to improve the performances of the least reliable source. Thus, by merging with other sources, it will provide useful information and will in turn contribute in improving the performance of the fusion system. The performance improvement of an information source can be affected through the correction of mass functions. In this context, the correction can be made based on measures of the relevance or sincerity of the studied source [14] . The confusion matrices present a data source from which meta-knowledge characterizing the state of a source can be extracted [17] . In this paper, the proposed fusion system is a hierarchical fusion system set up within the framework of belief function theory.

Indeed, the mass functions must be sufficiently representative of all available information. In our case, the data obtained at the output of the classifiers are uncertain because the sources have different degrees of reliability and are sometimes conflicting. It is therefore important that the mass functions can represent all these imperfections and take into account as much information as possible [1] . In our case, we have a large discernment framework (\u03a9 = 72 assumptions). To construct 2 72 focal elements and to give a mass to all possible combinations would lead to significant computational complexity. In the literature, there are several methods for constructing a mass function from a probability distribution, the best known of which are: bayesian mass functions and consonant mass functions [2] . We have studied and analyzed these two methods in depth. Following these studies, we found that by building bayesian mass functions, we obtain precise and certain focal elements. The obtained mass functions are representative enough of the available information and the focal elements are singletons which causes the elimination of certain species. Concerning consonant mass functions, we noticed that this method leads to the construction of large focal elements (made up of several species).

Computational complexity increases exponentially with the number of sources to be combined, and becomes even more important when the space of discernment is large. To limit the complexity of calculations, existing approaches rely either on procedures that involve exact calculations or on approximation techniques. In the first category, an optimal calculation algorithm has been proposed by Kennes in [9] . This algorithm makes it possible to considerably optimize the number of addition and multiplication operations when calculating mass functions and to reduce the complexity of the calculations. The disadvantage of this method is that the number of focal elements is not reduced since it is a procedure that performs exact calculations. This can be problematic in our case because we have to manage a large area of discernment and perform the same calculation for several sources of information. The second category of approaches is composed of mass functions approximation procedures. The mass functions approximation procedures allow the reduction of the number of focal elements based on different selection criteria. In particular, we focused on the most commonly used procedures: the \"Inner\" and \"Outer\" approximations [4] , the k \u2212 l \u2212 x [21] and the \"Summation method\" [11] .

Thus, if the classifier decides that it is the species e 2 , the contextual value of \u03b2 is that corresponding to the degree of sincerity of the classifier relative to the species e 2 . It is important to note that in our case, we consider that the decision of a classifier corresponds to the species with the maximum mass. Note that for most species, the context value of \u03b2 is zero. Thus, in these cases, the initial mass function is multiplied by zero and a null mass is given to the complement set.

Meta-knowledge is extracted from 9/10th samples, and the effectiveness of the correction method is tested on the remaining 10. This operation is repeated 10 times, and each time the configuration and test samples are randomly drawn. The end result is the average value of the 10 results corresponding to the 10 repetitions. Figure 2 shows the results obtained before and after the correction of the mass functions of the test database. Since botanists like to see similar species, we have presented the results of the good classification rate according to the number N of species selected. We note a significant improvement in classifier performance for both modalities. Nevertheless, through Table 4 representing the standard deviation for each classifier, we notice that the standard deviation is often important. Indeed, by randomly pulling the configuration data, the sets formed can be quite representative of the variations existing in the data as they can be weakly representative of these variations. The quality of the extracted meta-knowledge, therefore, varies according to the relevance of the configuration database, which subsequently influences the ability of the fusion system to generalize.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 494, "end": 502, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 863, "end": 870, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "Impact of the Proposed Method on the Classifier Performances"}, {"text": "In this paper, we presented the different mechanisms for correcting mass functions and applied the most appropriate ones for our application.

Work is in progress on the addition of the bark modality from which we can extract characteristics such as texture, color, ... which would allow us to differentiate between neighboring species. The bark-derived characteristics could serve as a meta-knowledge that we will use to resolve ambiguities when there are significant conflicts on species associated with leaf recognition.
