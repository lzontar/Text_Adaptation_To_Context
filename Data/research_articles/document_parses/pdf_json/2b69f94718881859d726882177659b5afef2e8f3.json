The secretory proprotein convertase (PC) category comprises nine members (PCSK1-PCSK9). The first member, PCSK1, is also called neuroendocrine convertase NEC1 and prohormone and PC1 and PC3; PCSK3 corresponds to furin (FUR: FeS upstream region) and PCSK8 to membrane-bound transcription factor site-1 peptidase (MBTPS1), or simply site peptidase S1P, and subtilisin-kexin isozyme SKI1, which cleaves membrane-bound transcription factors at nonbasic residues [233] . PCSK9 cleaves itself once, and the secreted inactive peptidase transfers low-(LDLR) and very-low-density lipoprotein receptors (VLDLRs) to the endosomal compartment for lysosomal degradation. It reduces inflammation in a LDLR-dependent manner [233] . 5 Although some smokers neither experience an infarct nor develop a cancer, smoking represents a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis and aneurysms. 6 Nutrient restriction and changes in dietary composition improve health during aging. In people (age 20-70 years) who consume a fasting mimicking diet (FMD; low in sugars and proteins but high in unsaturated lipids) for 5 days per month for 3 months and maintain their normal diet during the other periods in addition to their lifestyle and in control subjects who have an unrestricted diet for 3 months and who then switch to the fasting mode, FMD can reduce body weight and lipid-based depot, blood pressure, concentrations of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1), fasting glucose, triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol, LDL CS , and CRP, especially in individuals at risk for CVD [236] . \u2022 Cholesterol, in particular, LDP-cholesterol (LDL CS ) and its regulator proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin PCSK9 \u2022 Glucose \u2022 Natriuretic peptides ( Table 2 .5) in addition to N-terminal fragments of A-(atrial; ANP) and B-type (brain; BNP) natriuretic peptide precursors ( NT proANP and NT proBNP) 7 \u2022 Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 \u2022 Aldosterone \u2022 C-reactive protein (or pentraxin-1) \u2022 D Dimer 8 \u2022 Fibrinogen \u2022 Homocysteine \u2022 Troponins 9 \u2022 Growth differentiation factor (GDF15) Hence, an overlap exists between risk factors and markers. 7 The NT proBNP fragment is a HF marker used to evaluate its severity. 8D Dimer signals the presence of a thrombus. Plasmatic D dimer measurement is used when deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are suspected (concentration \u2265250 ng/ml) [237] . D Dimer is the degradation product of crosslinked fibrin by coagulation factor-XI I I and hence reflects activated hemostasis. Venous thrombosis usually results from venous stasis due to immobility or obstruction, a hypercoagulable state linked to triggers of the blood coagulation cascade, and possible wall injury. 9 Cardiac troponins cTnnT and cTnnI in addition to creatine kinase (CK) are widely used markers when myocardial infarction is suspected owing to their sensitivity and specificity for cardiomyocyte (CMC) necrosis. Lipoproteins (i.e., water-soluble protein-lipid complexes) mediate the transport of cholesterol and lipids in blood. Linkage of cholesterol to lipoproteins (HDLs and LDLs) enables its back and forth motion in blood between the liver and other organs. Relatively high concentration of cholesterol tethered to ApoB-containing (ApoB+) LDLs is an atherosclerosis risk marker. Cholesterol ester links to ApoA1+ HDLs.

Intestinal microbiota and bacterial metabolites are connected to dietary composition. Gut flora-derived metabolite trimethylamine N oxide (TMAO) is a small organic compound generated from betaine, carnitine, and choline [243] . 11 It accumulates in fishes, especially elasmobranchs, 12 and protects against the protein-destabilizing effect 13 and ligandbinding inhibition of urea at high concentrations in addition to adverse effects of temperature, salinity, and hydrostatic pressure. Its blood concentration, which depends on diet composition in addition to the activity of gut flora and liver FMO, increases after ingesting trimethylammonium-containing nutrients ( L carnitine and phosphatidylcholine-rich food), such as red meat, eggs, and fish [244] . Trimethylamine oxide is a risk factor for major adverse cardio-and cerebrovascular events (ACaVCeVE), especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. Plasmatic TMAO concentration correlates positively with ACaVCeVE and mortality [244] . Trimethylamine oxide, which impairs cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and the activity of sterol transporters in the liver and intestine, activates inflammation, 11 TMAO is synthesized from trimethylamine (TMA), which is generated by the action of gut microbiota from dietary choline and phosphatidylcholine (lecithin). The gut microbial metabolism of trimethylammonium-containing nutrients (e.g., choline, phosphatidylcholine, and L carnitine) forms TMA. In the liver, flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) converts TMA into TMAO. TMA is a gas that is oxygenated within living animals to form TMAO by FMO1 and FMO3. It can also be produced from L carnitine that is first converted into the intermediate metabolite \u03b3butyrobetaine and then into TMA, which is subsequently processed into TMAO by host hepatic FMO3 [243] . Trimethylamine oxide accumulates in organs as an osmolyte or is eliminated by the kidney. Several bacterial categories produce TMA and TMAO, Anaeroplasmataceae, Deferribacteraceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Prevotellaceae. In the human intestine, eight species from two different phyla (Firmicutes and Proteobacteria) and six genera (Anaerococcus hydrogenalis, Clostridium asparagiforme, hathewayi, and sporogenes, Escherichia fergusonii, Proteus penneri, Providencia rettgeri, and Edwardsiella tarda) and the choline-degrading sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans synthesize TMA from choline. Trimethylamine oxide can be metabolized to small methylated amines, such as tri-, di-, and monomethylamine, which are precursors of marine aerosols and the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide in the marine atmosphere [243] . 12 The term elasmobranch refers to cartilaginous fishes, such as sharks, sawfish, rays, and skates, which are endowed with rows of replaceable teeth and the five to seven gill slits on each side of their body. Selachians (group Selachii) consist of the sharks and dogfishes. Fishes of the class Chondrichthyes possess a cartilaginous skeleton, whereas bony fishes of the class Osteichthyes have a bony skeleton. The subclass Elasmobranchii contains about 1150 species of saltwaterand freshwater-dwelling fishes, which have various sizes and shapes, from the giant whale shark and huge manta ray to the dwarf lanternshark and tiny short-nosed electric ray, and from the hammerhead shark to sawfish. 13 In organisms that concentrate urea as an osmolyte and buoyancy factor, TMAO restores protein structure and their enzyme function [243] . and markedly reduces reverse cholesterol transport, may favor the formation of macrophage scavenger receptors and foam cells in the arterial wall [243, 244] .

Nine aaRSs (ArgRS, GlnRS, IleRS, LeuRS, LysRS, and MetRS, along with aspartyl-[AspRS or DaRS] and glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetases [Glu-ProRS or EPRS]) and three auxiliary aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional proteins (AIMP1-AIMP3) assemble into a multi-aaRS complex that operates in alternating activities of its members [269] . Under some circumstances, one of the aaRSs or AIMPs is released to trigger cell signaling (Table 2 .8). 21 In addition to their canonical role in translation, aaRSs have auxiliary functions in nutritional stress response, apoptosis, and cell survival along with the regulation of gene transcription and transcript translation via linkage to transcription factors or 20 A consensus sequence is an amino acid sequence of proteins that is generally used for intra-or intermolecular interactions, which enables the classification of functional sites [270] .

Microvesicles (or microparticles) are smaller and created by membrane blebbing. They can be released from most cell types (e.g., circulating leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets, in addition to vascular cells and CMCs). Their number increases under stress. Exosomes are formed by the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Extracellular vesicles transfer their cargos to recipient cells by membrane fusion, endocytosis, or receptor-mediated binding. Microparticle-derived arachidonic acid, oxidized phospholipids, and chemokines may contribute to increased leukocyte adhesion on the vascular endothelium. Apoptotic bodies can prime IL-1\u03b1 release by ECs. On the other hand, leukocyte-derived microparticles stimulate the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines their uptake from the circulation by Kupffer cells and splenocytes. Exosome turnover relies on uptake via tetraspanins, integrins, and lactadherin[464].Extracellular vesicles can be categorized into large, mid-size, and small particles. Small EVs can be further subdivided into subcategories according to proteic markers (e.g., Tspan28-Tspan30).Many subtypes of EVs are described in the literature, such as ectosomes, exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, membrane particles, and apoptotic vesicles (Vol. 10, Chap. 1.
