South Dakota, one of six states which does not have a statewide shelter 156 in place order (as of April 15, 2020), has experienced rapid case growth following an exposure 157 at a meat plant (Figure 3A). This has accounted for more than half of the state's cases 17 as of 158 April 15, 2020, with the fastest statewide doubling time of 4.5 days (Figure 3B). By contrast, 159 states with early shelter in place times like Arizona on March 11, 2020, California on March 19, 160 2020, and Connecticut on March 20, 2020 (Figure 3A) have much slower doubling times of 19.3 161 days, 22.8 days, and 12.7 days respectively (Figure 3B). 162 163 The web application located at covidcounties.org was first released to the public on April 3, 164 2020. It features two sections: a line plot depicting time-series trends in disease dynamics, and 165 a map depicting geospatial relationships (Figure 4). The site has had over 15 thousand unique 166 site in the first week as of April 11, 2020, most of whom accessed the website using a management of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hindered by both inaccurate 172 data collection and reporting, as well as relative inaccessibility by non-data scientists. Taken 173 together, these difficulties have impeded optimal policymaking by both government (imposing 174 social distancing policies) and health systems (anticipating ICU utilization) alike. Consequently, 175 responses across institutions have been highly variable and with varying degrees of success. To 176 help address these gaps we developed covidcounties.org and performed the technical 177 validation reported in this work. 178 179 .", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": ", these subtleties of the data collection process imply that the COVID-19 data 195 from The New York Times may not exactly agree with the numbers reported by various state 196 and county Departments of Public Health.

To date, 245 most states and counties are primarily providing case and death data with an increasing 246 number also providing hospitalization data. However, there is a severe lack of testing 247 information. The lack of testing data limits the ability to make inferences on the infection rate 248 in the population and the improvement of model trajectories. It has also been proposed that 249 there has been an under ascertainment of cases especially in the asymptomatic30   , which can 250 influence case rates. States and counties are continuously ramping up testing and this sudden 251 availability of tests can artificially distort counts by attributing individuals who were infected 252 previously to a later date due to an earlier shortage of tests.These numbers are further 253 complicated by the wide variety of commercially available tests that rely on different 254 technologies with varying sensitivity and specificity. 255 With its release, covidcounties.org represents a powerful open-source platform to empower 257 non-data scientists to track the current trends of the COVID-19 pandemic at the county level to 258 help facilitate policy and healthcare decisions which can help improve outcomes.
