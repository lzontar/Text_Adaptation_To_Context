Unfortunately, there is currently no clear answer for this clinical-radiologic dissociation. Many postulates have been offered. One is asymptomatic patients undergoing the \"healing phase\" of COVID-19 and symptoms subsiding by the time of admission and scan [6] .

There will inevitably be incidental detections in asymptomatic patients undergoing scans for other indications. A study in Italy found that six of 65 asymptomatic patients who underwent 18 F-FDG-PET/CT or 131 I-SPECT/CT for standard oncologic indications showed unexpected signs of interstitial pneumonia on CT and elevated regional FDG-avidity [8] . Radiology departments and staff may face significant risk when performing diagnostic imaging on patients who may not be suspected of harboring COVID-19 due to the subclinical nature of incidental COVID-19 infections. This is because a large proportion of patients who enter a hospital through the emergency department will ultimately receive some sort of diagnostic imaging [9] . Imaging procedures during an outbreak can also be impeded secondarily to the necessity of adhering to more stringent infection control protocols leading to longer scan times and decreased patient turnover [10] . Additionally, the requirement for faculty to work remotely may also impede the normal workflow to a certain degree and prolong the turnaround-time as studies take longer to transmit. Ultimately, the financial, human and clinical implications of incidental COVID-19 infections may not yet be apparent to radiology departments.",

Occupational health service is contacted to ensure the CT technologists who were involved are evaluated and further quarantined if they develop symptoms. These decisions have been based on the critically low staffing numbers being experienced at our institution due to the illness and quarantining. All quarantining decisions are based on a number of factors that include staffing number and symptoms, based on the Philadelphia Department of Public Health guidelines. These include no work exclusions for asymptomatic health care workers with twice daily symptom monitoring, temperature checks, and it being mandatory to wear masks. If symptomatic (Fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms), there is immediate work exclusion with testing for COVID-19.",
