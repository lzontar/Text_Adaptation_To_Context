The aims of this project were to develop a series of fleximer base analogues that not only possess inherent flexibility that can remain active when faced with binding site mutations, but also target a non-canonical, highly conserved target: the nucleocapsid protein of HIV (NC). The compounds were predicted by computational studies not to function via zinc ejection, which would endow them with significant advantages over non-specific and thus toxic zinc-ejectors. The target fleximer bases were synthesized using palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling techniques and subsequently tested against NC and HIV-1. The results of those studies are described herein.",

            "text": "To date, fleximers have shown key advantages over the corresponding purine-base nucleosides. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] For example, the distal guanosine fleximer (Flex-G, Fig. 1 ) proved to be an inhibitor of S-adenosyl-Lhomocysteine hydrolase by adapting a syn conformation, thereby placing the exocyclic amino group such that it mimicked the amino group from an adenosine nucleobase. 3, 4 Moreover, the guanosine fleximer triphosphate (Flex-GTP) was shown to be a superior substrate of human GDP-L-fucose pyrophosphorylase compared to the natural substrate GTP, 5 likely due to the fleximer's ability to interact with amino acids in the active site not accessible by GTP. 6 This also allowed Flex-GTP to retain all activity when essential catalytic residues needed for GTP binding were mutated. 5, 6 Recently, a series of fleximers possessing acyclic sugars exhibited broad spectrum antiviral activities against coronaviruses, flaviviruses and filoviruses, further supporting their significance. 10, 11 In an effort to explore the fleximer approach to other viruses such as HIV-1, a virus with the ability to readily mutate and develop antiviral resistance, a series of fleximers were designed and studied in silico for their ability to inhibit the virus' nucleocapsid protein, NC. [14] [15] [16] [17] NC plays several key roles in HIV-1 replication. Through non-specific binding, it acts as a chaperone protein, partially protecting the viral nucleic acids (NAs). 18 During reverse transcription, NC directs the annealing of cellular tRNA (Lys, 3) primer to the HIV-1 primer binding site, thus initiating the synthesis of the (\u2212)-strong stop DNA. 19, 20 NC then facilitates the two strand transfers required for (\u2212) and (+) strand synthesis. It is also implicated to be a vital element in vDNA integration. 21, 22 Prior to encapsidation, NC discriminates viral from host NA by selectively binding to the HIV-1 \u03a8-encapsidation signal sequence. [23] [24] [25] In addition, in vitro studies have shown that NC may chaperone the dimerization of the two copies of HIV-1 viral genomic RNA by rearranging the kissing complex into an extended duplex through a series of stabilizing and destabilizing events, an important step prior to encapsidation. 26, 27 Because of NC's interaction with multiple highly conserved sequences of the HIV-1 genome, and being essential in all HIV-1 subtypes NC represents a powerful drug target for developing novel antivirals. [28] [29] [30] [31] More importantly, it is thought to be highly resistant to mutation due to its multifunctional role, thus providing a significant advantage over other protein targets. 26, 32 Thus, inhibitors of the interaction between NC and the viral nucleic acids could provide a new approach to antiretroviral therapy. 14, 33 For this purpose, a series of fleximers were computationally designed with that goal in mind. Herein we report the synthesis and biological results for a series of compounds that were predicted to interact with NC.",

As a result, the corresponding fleximer base analogues were therefore pursued, since this would signfiicantly shorten the synthetic route. Thus, the fleximer bases were then tested computationally against the NMR structure of the NC in complex with a small molecule inhibitor (Figs. 2 and 3). 37 To this end, a computational protocol was established and refined in the group of Botta. 14, 33, 38 Several NC binding small molecules have already been discovered through this protocol, supporting its validity. 14, 15, 33, 38 The docking results of the fleximer bases on NC revealed several key advantages for the proposed target compounds. The docking conformation of fleximer bases 1-4 ( Fig. 3 ) within the hydrophobic pocket that is located in correspondence of W37 showed an excellent structural overlay with respect to the guanine base. Moreover, all of the fleximer bases were able to establish a network of H-bond interactions with the backbone atoms of key residues in the hydrophobic pocket (i.e. K33, G35, W37, and M46, Fig. 3A -D) that is highly comparable to that established by the guanine base (Fig. 3E) . Additionally, 1-4 adopted a similar stacking conformation to W37 as is observed with the natural guanine. However the additional rotatable bond allowed for the pyrimidine moiety to extend and interact with the neighboring residues (i.e. K47 in the binding mode of 4, Fig. 3D ) into the solvent area.",

Deprotection using catalytic sulfuric acid and TMSCl in acetic anhydride also did not produce 2 (confirmed through MS). The hypothesis to explain this phenomenon ties into the in silico results by Bardon et al. that showed that the most thermodynamically stable conformation of the proximal fleximer bases is in a planar form. 50 This conformation could be promoting the stacking of the bases that consequently does not allow 37 to solubilize in usual solvents.",

If yields could be improved, this would potentially be useful for synthesis of distal fleximer nucleosides in the future. Biologically however, these molecules were not recognized by NC based on the NMR experiment performed, and were inactive against HIV-1. While the biological results were disappointing, the project did provide a better understanding of palladium-catalysed cross-coupling strategies for fleximer bases in terms of choosing the optimum crosscoupling partners. This which has proven advantageous for other projects ongoing in our group and others, the results of which will be published as they become available.",

The expression vector pET-3a (Novagen, Madison, WI) was doubly digested with NdeI and BamHI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphate. The PCR product was purified by phenol-extraction and ethanol-precipitation and doubly digested with NdeI and BamHI. The insert and vector were ligated using phage T4 DNA ligase at 16\u00b0C for five hours and transformed into competent HMS174. DNA from transformants were sequenced and found to be identical with the HIV-1 NC coding sequence in pNL4-3. A clone, designated as pRD2, overexpressed the 55-residue NC protein with the sequence M Q K G N F R N Q R K T V K C F N C G K E G H I A K N C R A P R K K G C W K C G K E G H Q M K D C T E R Q A N (the two zinc knuckles are underlined).

The purification scheme for the recombinant HIV-1 NC was adapted from Ji et al. 56 and You & McHenry. 57 Culture media were supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/l ampicillin and 34 \u03bcg/L chloramphenicol. A starter culture of 20 ml of ZB 58 inoculated from a single colony was grown at 37\u00b0C overnight. The starter culture was added to 2 l of M9ZB 58 supplemented with 0.1 mM ZnCl 2 and grown at 37\u00b0C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5 to 0.6 before induction with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside). After three hours, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM ZnCl 2 , 5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA), and stored at 70\u00b0C. To lyse the cells, the cells were thawed in ice-water, and 172 ml of 10 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 30 ml of 1 mg/ ml pepstatin A, and 2.1 ml of 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate were added. The cells were sonicated by five bursts of 20 seconds to reduce the viscosity. The nucleic acids were precipitated by adding 4% (w/v) polyethyleneimine (pH 7.9) dropwise to a final concentration of 0.4% and stirred for 15 minutes before centrifugation at 23,000 g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected (42 ml), filtered (0.45 \u03bcm pore size), and loaded at 1 ml/minute onto a 20 mL Q-Sepharose and a 20 ml SP-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) connected in series and previously equilibrated with 200 ml of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM ZnCl 2 , 10 mM BME (\u03b2mercaptoethanol)). After washing with 60 ml of buffer A, the Q-Sepharose column was detached, and the SP-Sepharose column was washed with 1.5 column volumes of buffer A. A ten column volume linear gradient from 40% to 50% buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1.0 M NaCl, 0.1 mM ZnCl 2 , 10 mM BME) was applied to elute the HIV-1 NC protein. The protein fractions were pooled (15 ml) and loaded at 0.5 ml/minute onto a 320 ml Sephadex G-50 column (Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with two volumes of buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10% glycerol, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 10 mM BME). The NC protein eluted at 175 ml and fractions were pooled (35 ml) for concentration and dialysis into NMR buffer (see below).",
