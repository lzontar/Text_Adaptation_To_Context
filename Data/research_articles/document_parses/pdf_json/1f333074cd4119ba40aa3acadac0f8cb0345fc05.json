They use serological tests to examine a large number of blood samples from people without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection to detect signs that they were once infected with the virus. That is, serological tests detect our body's response to the virus but not the virus itself (as opposed to molecular tests). Therefore, they cannot be used early in infection before the patient's body has already developed an antibody response. Thus, serological tests are not much helpful for clinicians to diagnose infection in individual persons. However, they are extremely useful for epidemiological purposes to understand the immunity landscape of the population at large.",

Detecting people who are potentially immune to SARS-CoV-2 could even play an important role in when and how social distancing restrictions are lifted. The results of serological surveys can also be useful in guiding strategic decisions on essential staffing in hospitals and other health care facilities -for example, by assigning to the forefront those who are probably immune.
