Our five patients presented 336 episodes of hemoptysis, anemia of varying degrees, and their chest radiographs 337 showed diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates consistent with pulmonary 338 hemorrhage.

In three 339 of the five cases, the severity of the initial pulmonary hemorrhage was sufficient 340 to cause acute pulmonary distress, requiring adequate ventilatory support and to 341 cause severe anemia requiring packed red blood cell transfusion. In all our cases, 342 due to young age, systemic vasculitis and collagen vascular disorders were 343 unlikely. 344 In all cases, pediatric pulmonologists performed a bronchial fibroscopy in order 345 to look for active bleeding in the airways. In the absence of obvious cause of the 346 bleeding, BAL was performed. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages were found in 347 BAL only in 2 of our 5 patients, either due to early performance of the BAL 348 within 24 hours from hemoptysis or due to limitations of the bronchoscopy 349 procedure because of hemodynamic instability of the patients. As previously 350 mentioned, HLMs were not demonstrated in the cytological analysis until 48-72 351 hours after the acute phase.

In our second case,368 culture analysis of tracheal aspirate samples identified the presence of 369 Chlamydia Trachomatis. Infants born vaginally from infected mothers are at risk 370 of acquiring Chlamydia trachomatis, which can lead to severe tracheobronchial 371 or pneumonic infection and DAH. In our third case, polymerase chain reaction 372 of tracheal aspirate samples identified the presence of Coronavirus NL63. 373 Coronavirus is a common cause of upper respiratory tract infection in children 374 and has also been occasionally associated with lower respiratory tract infections 375 (such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia) and with pulmonary hemorrhage [8]. At 376 present, there are seven coronaviruses recognized as human pathogens (HCoV): 377 HCoV-OC43, HCoV-299E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, SARS CoV, MERS-378 CoV and the newly identified SARS COV-2 [25].
