That review noted how the severity and impact of each pandemic is different and that the impact and relevance of school closure would, to a large extent, depend on the epidemiological and virologic characteristics of the pandemic strain, and the severity of disease [12] . For example, school closure may have had a more substantial effect during the 1957 pandemic, when much of the transmission occurred among children, than it would have had in 1918 when young adults were also affected, or in 1968 when illness attack rates were similar among children and adults [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 223, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 492, "end": 496, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 792, "end": 796, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "The review also highlighted that the generic expression \"school closure\" reflects very different strategies.

At the time, the review concluded that health benefits could be expected (in particular a reduction of healthcare service demand at the peak of the outbreak) to an extent that would depend on the epidemiological characteristics of the virus and the way the policy would be implemented. Equally though, it was recognised that school closure is associated with high economic, social and educational costs and could potentially disrupt healthcare provision via increased absenteeism of clinical staff attending to their children [12] . Since then, analyses of additional data collected during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic have made it possible to further quantify the impact of closures so that literature assessing impact is now substantial [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1006, "end": 1010, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1219, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1223, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1224, "end": 1227, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1232, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1237, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1242, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1247, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1252, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1257, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1262, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1267, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1272, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1277, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1282, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1287, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1288, "end": 1292, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1297, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1302, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Although essential, assessment of impact is only one of the elements that inform school closure policies.

Initial media reports from Mexico in early April 2009 caused concerns about the severity of the emerging pandemic.

Japan implements a policy of closure of classes, grades and schools (C-CGS) during seasonal influenza epidemics. This is a gradualist policy. For example, Japan will close a class if a certain percentage (usually 10-20%) of students are absent; close a grade if \u2265 2 classes in the grade meet the above criterion; and close a school if \u2265 2 grades of the school meet the same criterion. The exact criteria for closures are usually defined by the local board of education; but a final decision is made by each school. In Japan, there is no nationwide recommendation apart from the notification to schools from the Ministry of Education (Item No. 1125) about the prevention of influenzalike illness (ILI) that dates back to 1982 and indicates that \"class closure should be considered when the rate of student absenteeism due to infection reaches approximately 15-20%\".

Indeed, the arguments in favor or against closure are already quite well known: it is a matter of finding the right balance between mitigating and delaying spread versus paying the potentially high cost associated with closure. Therefore, the question is not so much about the arguments used by countries to justify their decisions but more about why they made different appreciations of the health benefits and the economic and social costs of the intervention. In the end, we believe that the single most important factor to explain these differences was the very different public health practises and public expectations concerning school closures and influenza in the countries selected. For example, Japan and Bulgaria consider school closure as routine during seasonal influenza epidemics; and in HK, closures are expected from the population and politicians during large-scale infectious disease outbreaks. By contrast, it may require a severe pandemic for the intervention to be considered as a policy option, for example, in the UK. Obviously, these different interpretations were made possible because of the absence of a clear cut scientific/public health answer on the anticipated impact of school closures in a pandemic of moderate severity such as the A(H1N1) pdm09 pandemic, illustrated by the \"grey zone\" in Figure 1 . Though closing schools was expected to have a significant impact on transmission dynamics in 2009 because of the age-specific transmission profile of the pandemic virus, one must ask if the benefits outweigh the high economic and social costs of closure, especially given that disease severity was relatively limited. This left considerable room for different views on the effectiveness to be transformed into policy. A last factor was the complexity of school systems and hence decision making with co-existing state and religious systems plus private schools in a number of countries.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1654, "end": 1662, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Different school closure policies and expectations"}, {"text": "Implementing reactive closures of schools on a relatively large scale requires that surveillance systems are in place in schools to monitor illness and absenteeism rates.

The information is analyzed at the Ministry of Education and shared with the Ministry of Health. This process is performed on a daily basis.

Notifying closures: In the spring 2009 wave, since decisions of closures had to be made after the end of the school day, notifications of closure had to be made via media and word of mouth. Representatives of the Department of Health and of the Department of Education were also present in the morning of closure at school to notify or discuss with parents. Making parents part of the strategy: In the autumn 2009 wave, the Department of Education did not plan to close schools with influenza activity but rather emphasized teaching students preventive measures (e.g., wash/sanitize hands often, avoid touching mouth and nose etc) and parents were instructed to keep children home if they had ILI. Communication with families and principals was therefore an essential part of the strategy: letters were sent home to families with the children during the first week of school and throughout the influenza season; information materials were provided to schools; outreach was implemented to community education councils and parent groups; weekly influenza updates were sent to all school principals and there was also ongoing communication with school nurses. At the end of each school day, the Department of Education reported online attendance rates and instances of ILI in public schools. If a school reported five cases of ILI among students in attendance, parents were sent a second letter on keeping ill children at home and the school reinforced messages on hand washing and covering coughs.

Also there had been considerable planning on how to educate and manage children if the schools had to close. But local authorities were reluctant to close schools due to a combination of lower risk perception and a general pattern of local public policy-making where the primary objective is to maintain normal life, unless an immediate and major risk is identified.
