Initially, the pneumonia presented with symptoms of respiratory infection, but some patients experienced severe disease that ultimately progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or even death. COVID-19 has had a great impact on Wuhan, other regions of China, and most other countries worldwide.

This descriptive study investigated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the first 29 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Henan Provincial People's Hospital, a hospital designated to admit confirmed patients from across Henan. The study revealed valuable information on the characteristics of the first severe COVID-19 infections diagnosed in Henan following the start of the outbreak in Hubei. It also includes outcomes in patients with treatment that included TCMs. Differences in some demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease were significant. Previous coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV 2012, challenged the health care system of the country. SARS-COV resulted in 8,096 infections and 774 deaths, in 29 countries (17) . SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious in humans, with 823,626 infections and 40,598 deaths occurring in more than 200 countries by April 2020. The reported mortality of SARS-CoV has been reported as 5-10% and that of MERS-CoV as 35.7% (18, 19) . Only one patient in this series (3.4%) died, which is lower than the 4.3-15% previously reported in Wuhan (20) (21) (22) . Perhaps the severity of imported COVID-19 infections will be reduced compared with those diagnosed in Hubei province. The patients in this series were between 20 and 90 years of age; the largest percentage (9/29; 31%) were middle-aged. Unlike a previous study in Wuhan that reported increased susceptibility in older men, this series included similar percentages of men and women (21) . The largest proportion of patients (11/29; 38%) were agricultural workers, the others had diverse occupations. Four patients, two doctors and two nurses, worked in local hospitals and provided care for patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections, which supports the interpersonal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

The only death was of an 86-years-old woman on the third day after admission, and it resulted from progressive respiratory failure and two cardiac arrests. Twentyeight patients had recent histories of contact with confirmed or probable COVID-19 infection. Four were health care personnel, and except for a 61-years-old woman, the remaining 24 had returned from travel to Hubei province.

Thirdly, although the patients were stratified by the severity of their clinical and epidemiological characteristics, it was difficult to analyze the association of differences between variables and severity because the load of infection was not determined.
