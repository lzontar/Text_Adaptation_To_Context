            "text": "Decision or optimization problems often arise in an uncertain context. Depending on available information, several approaches have been proposed to model this uncertainty (e.g. possibility theory [17] , evidence theory [18] , etc.). In this paper, we focus on the case of low knowledge on possible states, namely decision under ignorance. In this case the decision-maker is able to give the set of possible values of optimization problem parameters but she/he is not able to differentiate them. In other words, all possible parameter values are all possible (this is a particular case in possibility theory when all scenarios have possibility equal to 1). Hurwicz-Arrow proposed a decision under ignorance theory [3] that specifies the properties that a criterion must satisfy. One of the most popular criteria in this context is the Wald criterion (maxmin criterion). Recently, a considerable amount of literature on robust optimization has studied this maxmin criterion [1, 4] , and [10] . This criterion is very pessimistic since it focuses on the worst case scenario. Moreover, it is necessary to meet the underlying condition that all scenarios are almost possible (ignorance context). Otherwise, other criteria are more relevant, see [10] . Other criteria have been proposed to take decisionmaking under ignorance behavior into account. The oldest one is the Hurwciz criterion which consists in modeling optimism by making a linear aggregation with the best and the worst evaluation. This criterion has been used to model the behavior of a decision-maker in different contexts (see [5, 14, 15, 19] ...etc) and has been spread to include imprecise probability theory [12] . This criterion has been criticized in a sequential decision context since it does not satisfy the desired properties in this decision context (for more details see [6, 11] ).",

We tackle the problem of optimization under ignorance by taking the optimism of the decision-maker into account as a bi-objective optimization problem where the first criterion is the pessimistic point of view and second one is the optimistic point of view. So, we study some properties such as the Pareto optimality of the optimal solution to those criteria. The paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we set out the problem being studied, then we recall the decision under ignorance and we present the four criteria that will be studied. Then, we compare the properties of the optimal solutions to the linear programming problem for all those criteria. Then, the computational aspects of R * are discussed. Finally, we propose a new criterion which generalizes Hurwicz, R * and R * which satisfy the decision under ignorance properties and under some conditions the Pareto optimality.",

More precisely, the solutions that offer a good guarantee but have a good opportunity (for instance the coordinates point [2.2,7] ) will never be considered. Conversely, R * is too permissive and accepts solutions dominated in the Pareto sense.

The second class includes R * and Hurwicz. The use of these criteria may lead to a compromised solution which is not completely robust nor completely opportunistic. We show that R * and Hurwicz do not lead to the same solution of a linear programming problem. More precisely, R * solution can be on the concave part of Pareto front while Hurwicz solution can be only on the convex part of Pareto front. Moreover, R * is more stable to small changes in optimistic/pessimistic parameter value (namely e) than Hurwicz. Previously it was shown that R * has similar good mathematical properties for sequential decision problems in comparison with Hurwicz.

Another research perspective is to generalize R * and I for other uncertainty contexts as possibility theory, evidence theory, and imprecise probability theory.",
