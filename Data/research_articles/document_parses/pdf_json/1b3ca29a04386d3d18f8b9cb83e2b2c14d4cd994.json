COVID-19 has since spread worldwide causing tens of thousands of deaths (2) . To combat the spread of COVID-19, the Chinese government sealed off several cities reporting large numbers of infected people, including Wuhan, starting January 23, 2020; this included halting public transportation and closing local businesses. These prevention efforts quickly expanded nationwide. The policy announcements and restrictions, applied at an unprecedented scale, have implications for the Chinese environment and the economy that we quantitatively evaluate in this paper. In particular, we use satellite nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measurements to monitor changes in fossil fuel usage, related to economic activity, over China following the outbreak of COVID-2019. Nitrogen oxides (NO + NO2 = NOx), emitted during high temperature combustion, are relatively short-lived in the atmosphere (lifetimes of the order of hours near the surface), and therefore remain relatively close to their sources (3) . NO2 tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) retrieved from backscattered solar radiation, such as from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI; 4), has been widely used to monitor both long term and short-term changes in fuel consumption (5, 6) . OMI's successor, the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI; 7) offers a higher spatial resolution measurement of NO2 TVCD.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 113, "end": 116, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 191, "end": 194, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1104, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1346, "end": 1349, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1352, "text": "6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "We observe substantial reductions of NO2 TVCD after the 2020 Lunar New Year (LNY) on January 25, 2020. Figure 1 shows 20-day averages of OMI NO2 TVCD before, during and after the 2020 LNY (hereafter referred to as the \"pre\", \"peri\" and \"post\" periods). An average reduction of 48% in NO2 TVCD over China is observed from pre to peri periods. Consistency in the trends of retrieved NO2 TVCD is found between OMI and its successor TROPOMI ( Figure   S1 ). A reduction in NO2 TVCD is typically observed during LNY because most Chinese factories shut down for the holiday and the traffic volumes decrease, resulting in a decrease in fuel consumption and thus NOx emissions. OMI NO2 TVCD shows an average pre to peri decline of 26% from data covering the 2015 to 2019 period (Fig. S2 ). Similarly, TROPOMI shows a reduction of 33% in 2019 (Fig. S3 ). This suggests that the observed reduction in 2020 far exceeds the typical holiday-related pre to peri period reduction. Consistent with the 2015-2019 data, the 2020 NO2 TVCD 7-day moving averages show a significant reduction during approximately the two weeks leading up to LNY and reach a minimum around LNY, consistent with the gradual shutdown of factories before the holiday (Fig. 2) . In prior years, a rebound of NO2 TVCD usually begins around 7 days after LNY, marking the end of the holiday season. OMI and TROPOMI (Fig. S4 ) NO2 TVCDs show similar temporal patterns prior to 2020 with a clear reduction before LNY and an increase shortly thereafter. However, while the 2020 data show similar initial declines in the week leading up to LNY, we do not observe the typical uptick in NO2 TVCDs starting the week after the LNY as in previous years (Fig. 2) . OMI (and TROPOMI) NO2 TVCDs show a longer period of low values near the minimum. Note that the 2020 data are generally lower than previous years, probably reflecting in part the effects of China's clean air policies that require installation of denitrification devices for all coal-fired power plants and cement plants (8) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2028, "end": 2031, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 111, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 439, "end": 450, "text": "Figure   S1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 770, "end": 778, "text": "(Fig. S2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 834, "end": 842, "text": "(Fig. S3", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1233, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1369, "end": 1377, "text": "(Fig. S4", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1706, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "To rule out the possibility that the large NO2 TVCD decreases observed in 2020 may be driven by changes in the meteorological conditions affecting local NOx chemistry and NOx transport, we use Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 Chemistry-Climate Model (GEOS-CCM; 9) simulations with constant emissions. We find the simulated effects of meteorology on NO2 TVCD small as compared with the prolonged NO2 reduction we observe from the pre to peri period (Fig. S5 ). The simulation with constant emissions shows many areas with increases from the pre to peri periods (Fig. S6 ). This suggests that in many areas the actual decrease in NOx emissions may be larger than what is inferred from the observed NO2 TVCDs. (Fig. S8 ).

Once the government publicly reports that a COVID-19 case has been confirmed in a province, the public in that province might choose to reduce their exposure to others (e.g., stay at home, work from home and/or travel less). In that case, we would expect a reduction in NO2 TVCD following the announcement of the first case in each province. This is indeed what we find, after taking previous years' NO2 TVCD and variation across provinces into account (see Eq. S1): following the report of the first case in each province, OMI NO2 TVCD declined by about 27% (coeff = -1.383, p = 0.002, Table 1 Col. 1).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 220, "end": 229, "text": "(Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 820, "end": 827, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "The second policy intervention is more invasive: the government took decisive action to further reduce the spread of the virus by limiting the mobility of citizens and locking down entire provinces; on average, lockdowns occurred 3.7 days after the report of the first case.

GMI model output and policy response data is available upon request from the authors as is code to process all data sets. Satellite NO2 observations We use retrieved NO2 TVCD from both OMI and TROPOMI. OMI is a Dutch-Finnish UV-VIS spectrometer (4) on board the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aura satellite that was launched in 2004. TROPOMI is a UV-VIS-NIR-SWIR instrument (7) on board the European Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite that was launched in 2017. Both instruments similarly measure Earth radiance and solar irradiance spectra with spectral resolutions of approximately 0.5 nm. The ratio of radiance to irradiance at wavelengths between 400 and 496 nm is used to retrieve NO2 TVCD. The ground footprint sizes are 13\u00d724 km 2 and 3.5\u00d75.5 km 2 (3.5\u00d77 km 2 before August, 2019) at nadir for OMI and TROPOMI, respectively.Both instruments provide nearly daily to bi-daily global coverage with a local equator crossing times close to 13:30 h. We use the version 4.0 NASA OMI standard NO2 products(17). We use the version 1.0.0 TROPOMI Level 2 offline NO2 data products for 2019 and the version 1.1.0 data for 2020(18). OMI and TROPOMI measurements are aggregated to resolutions of 0.25\u00b0\u00d70.25\u00b0 and 0.05\u00b0\u00d70.05\u00b0, respectively. A given gridbox value is computed by averaging the pixel-level satellite observations weighted by the amount of the pixel footprint that overlaps the gridbox. We remove OMI observations with effective cloud fractions >30% to reduce retrieval errors and those affected by the so-called \"row anomaly\"(19). For TROPOMI, we use only observations with quality assurance values > 0.75.For the maps shown, we calculate 20-day means of NO2 TVCD around the Lunar New Year using OMI during 2015-2020 and TROPOMI for 2019 and 2020. We only include regions dominated by anthropogenic NOx emissions in the analysis; these are defined as regions with average annual OMI NO2 TVCDs > 1\u00d710 15 molec/cm 2 over the period of 2005-2019(Fig S7;", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "The locations of 245 heavy industry plants including steel, iron, coke, oil, cement and glass industry, and 103 power plants considered in this analysis are shown in Figure S7.

The simulation uses the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemistry mechanism (22) and the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport component of GEOS-5 (23, 24) to interact with the GMI chemistry. The simulation's meteorology is constrained by the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA2; 25) assimilated meteorological data from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) GEOS-5 data assimilation system.

Constant biomass burning emissions are the January 2020 monthly mean from the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset version 2 (QFED2; 28).
