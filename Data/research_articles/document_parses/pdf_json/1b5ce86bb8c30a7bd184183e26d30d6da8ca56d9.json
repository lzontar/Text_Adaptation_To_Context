Nucleic acid testing is the standard method for the diagnosis of viral infections. However, this method reportedly has a low positivity rate. To increase the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnoses, we developed an IgM-IgG combined assay and tested it in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 56 patients were enrolled in this study and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using both IgM-IgG antibody and nucleic acid tests. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Our findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response.

Furthermore, the respiratory tract might not be the only route for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.13 While nucleic acid testing of pharyngeal swabs suggest negative results, whether subjects carry the virus in other organs such as the intestine remains unclear. Thus, rapid, low-cost, and universal detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 are needed. Our study showed that the virus-specific antibody test had a significantly higher positive result rate than the nucleic acid test. In addition to the self limitation of PCR test kits, the timing for specimens collection and PCR detection also does great impact on PCR results. In our study, due to the urgency condition and limitation of PCR kits supply in Wuhan, most patients might miss the best chance for early SARS-CoV-2 screening. Specimens collected in the late stage of illness while viral copies may have declined below detectable limits, which may lead to low positive rate for PCR and high titers of IgM and IgG. Furthermore, this may be one of the possible explanations for a large proportion of severe cases in our study.Two consecutive negative results of the nucleic acid test in a 24-hour interval are considered as clearance of COVID-19. However, several reports showed that a small portion of such recovered patients tested positive for infection through the nucleic acid test again during a follow-up visit. These results only indicate the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the patients, not whether reinfection or recurrence has occurred. One possible solution for this is to detect the titer of IgG in these patients, as the level of IgG usually increases with reinfection of the same virus. Although the IgM-IgG test is an important index for the diagnosis of COVID-19, limitations still exist. The variation of the methodology and antigens used in the IgM and IgG antibody detection kits are essential for the testing sensitivity and specificity. Li et al 11 reported the testing sensitivity as 88.66% and specificity as 90.63% in the IgM-IgG combined antibody testing kits by using receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein as the antigen. Another study suggested a very poor sensitivity of VivaDiag COVID-19 IgM-IgG rapid test which could not be recommended for diagnosis of COVID-19. 14 Considering the kits used in our study, the E protein functions to assemble the virions and N protein is the most conserved and stable protein among the CoV structural proteins. However, false positives might appear if cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses occurs. Hence, more studies with larger sample sizes and controls are needed to further verify the specificity and accuracy of this test. In summary, the combination of nucleic acid testing and the IgM-IgG antibody test is the optimal method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
