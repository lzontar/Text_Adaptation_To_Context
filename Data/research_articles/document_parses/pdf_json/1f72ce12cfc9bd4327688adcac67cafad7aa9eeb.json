Many teams around the world began working to close the projected gap in ventilator availability and used the RMVS specification as the starting point for their efforts.",

Both ventilators take up to 2 s to achieve desired inspiratory pressure, and almost as long to release this pressure. This results in a saw-tooth inspiratory pressure wave rather than the square wave observed in commercial ventilators. The long rise time is likely to mimic a trigger or flow asynchrony, and may even mimic the 'dishout' pattern that has been associated with prolonged ventilation. Delayed release of inspiratory pressure may mimic termination asynchrony as well as leading to loss of effective expiratory time, potentially resulting in autopositive end expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP).",

It suggests pressure regulated volume control, or pressure controlled ventilation as the preferred modes and requires the ability to deliver 400 ml breaths at up to 30 min -1 with an inspiratory:expiratory ratio of 1:2. The Australian specification [2] goes a little further, requiring a minimal achievable inspiratory flow of 100 l.min \u00c01 , and suggests the capacity to deliver 150 l.min \u00c01 . However, even this guidance fails to express the requirement for rapid initiation of inspiration and also the need to rapidly release inspiratory pressure back to the set expiratory pressure.",
