Compared to the severe group, critical cases were of significantly older ages and showed higher white blood cell counts and neutrophil counts. Levels of VEGF-D, TNF-\u03b1, SCF, LIF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 were significantly higher in the critical group than in the severe group (Table 1) . Additionally, lymphocyte count, CRP, LDH, and coagulation indicators (D-dimer, platelet count, PT, and APTT), which were reported to associate with clinical outcome [4, 5] , were also included in the random forests model. Strikingly, VEGF-D was identified as the most important indicator related to the severity of COVID-19 (ranked as 1, Fig. 1a ). As expected, D-dimer, age, IL-6, and lymphocyte count associated with clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients reported previously were also highly ranked. VEGF-D had a higher area under the curve (AUC) (0.836 (95% CI 0.648-1); Fig. 1b ) than Ddimer (0.755 (95% CI 0.527-0.982); Fig. 1c ). Consistently, VEGF-D levels were positively correlated with sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (Fig. 1d ). As shown in Fig. 1e , critical patients had higher levels of VEGF-D than the severe cases during the whole course of hospitalization.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first report of VEGF-D as a potential biomarker for detecting the progression of COVID-19. Despite limited evidence in COVID-19, previous studies demonstrated an important role of VEGF in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by its properties to increase vascular permeability. Furthermore, VEGF is regarded as an indirect procoagulant for altering the WBC white blood cells, CRP C-reactive protein, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, PT prothrombin time, APTT activated partial thromboplastin time, ALT alanine aminotransferase, VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor; TNF-\u03b1 tumor necrosis factor-alpha, SCF stem cell factor; LIF leukemia inhibitory factor, IL interleukin, IFN interferon hemostatic features of endothelial cells [6] . We hypothesized that elevated VEGF-D level might potentially relate to the storm of blood clots occurring in COVID-19 patients. Notably, it is of great interest to investigate the therapeutic effects of VEGF inhibitor in COVID-19 patients. This study has limitations, including the small sample size, a single-center experience, and a variable time interval of each patient from admission to symptoms onset. Studies based on a larger cohort in additional sites are needed to verify our findings. ",
