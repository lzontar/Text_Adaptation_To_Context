            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a frequent cause of acute respiratory infections (ARI), especially in children. Upper HRSV infections spread to the lower respiratory tree to an extent generally considered proportional to the severity of the disease [Collins and Crowe, 2007] . With the advent of highly sensitive molecular diagnostic methods, reports of codetection of multiple respiratory viruses in the same sample have become increasingly frequent [Greensill et al., 2003; Wolf et al., 2006; Paranhos-Baccal\u00e0 et al., 2008; Gagliardi et al., 2009] . However, the implications of the simultaneous detection of other respiratory viruses in children with HRSV-attributable disease have not been fully clarified [Semple et al., 2005; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2006] . The vast majority of clinical studies concerning this question have attributed \"HRSV-positivity\" to nucleic acid detection by RT-PCR, with no attempt to distinguish current HRSV replication from prolonged shedding of remnant RNA from previous HRSV infections [Semple et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2012] . The present study was done to try shedding light on whether codetections of other common respiratory viruses were associated with increased severity of ARI episodes confirmed to be HRSV-related by the shedding of viable HRSV, recoverable from respiratory secretions in cell cultures.",

The samples were collected from children under 5 years of age with ARI seen at the University of S\u00e3 o Paulo Hospital or at the Santa Lydia Community Hospital, both in the city of Ribeir\u00e3 o Preto, Brazil (21\u02da10 0 S; 47\u02da50 0 W), from January through December of 2005. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained by previously described procedures [Cintra et al., 2001] and sent to the laboratory in less than 4 hr, to be screened for HRSV by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and hemi-nested RT-PCR. In the virology laboratory the sample suction trap was washed with a small amount of PBS to complete a total volume of approximately 3 ml, and samples were treated with antibiotic/antimycotic (1 mg/ml of penicillin, 1 mg/ml of streptomycin, 0.0025 mg/ml of amphothericin B and 1 mg/ml of ciprofloxacin) for 1 hr at 4\u02daC, and then distributed into two 250 ml aliquots mixed with 750 ml of TRIzol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and another two 500 ml backup aliquots mixed 1:1 with 500 ml of VTM. VTM consists of minimal essential medium with Eagle's salts plus 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 15% glycerol, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (all from Life Technologies). All backup aliquots were stored at \u00c070\u02daC until being used. The remainders of NPAs were used to prepare glass slides for HRSV screening by IF using HRSV-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb 858-4; Millipore, Bilerica, MA) diluted 1:100 in PBS, followed by washing three times in PBS and detection with Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey Antimouse IgG (Life Technologies) 1:200 in PBS for 30 min.",

            "text": "With the advent of clinically applicable rapid antigen detection and RT-PCR-based assays for HRSV, time-consuming primary isolation of this agent in cell culture has become restricted to research laboratories. Detection of respiratory virus antigens or nucleic acids has facilitated studies of multiple agents all over the world confirming that HRSV is a very frequent agent, yet often detected simultaneously with other respiratory viruses [Collins and Crowe, 2007; Sly and Jones, 2011; Martin et al., 2012] . Several of those studies compared the severity of respiratory illnesses in patients whose secretions were positive by RT-PCR for HRSV-only, with those positive by PCR for other respiratory viruses concurrently with HRSV, and most of them have not reported significant differences [Canducci et al., 2008; Nascimento et al., 2010; De Paulis et al., 2011] . However, detection of HRSV nucleic acids by RT-PCR in respiratory secretions should not be regarded as firm evidence of current HRSV-associated illness, since that could result from the presence of a molecular remnant of previous infection [Franz et al., 2010] . Therefore, the present study was done to reassess the relevance of co-detecting other respiratory viruses in secretions collected from ARI patients currently harboring replication of HRSV, whose viability was confirmed by virus recovery in cell culture. This study was done with samples collected in 2005 from children younger than 5 years, and HRSVpositive patients, detectable by any diagnostic methods, had disease significantly more severe than those negative for HRSV, thus reaffirming HRSV as an important pathogen. HRSV-positive patients had higher clinical severity scores and required more oxygen and mechanical respiratory support, thus reiterating that HRSV-related illnesses impact strongly on healthcare resources. But clinical features were not significantly different between patients excreting viable HRSV and those shedding only HRSV nucleic acid detectable by RT-PCR. This finding indicates that shedding of HRSV RNA is a practical marker of current replication of the agent, and supports its detection by RT-PCR in routine HRSV clinical diagnosis. The frequency of HRSV primary recovery in cell culture would probably have been higher if monolayers had been inoculated with freshly collected, rather than frozen specimens, due to reduced virion stability upon freeze-thawing. However, primary HRSV isolation in fresh samples is labor intensive and only rarely done on routine basis, especially in health care facilities of developing countries. Moreover, long turnaround times would likely make it impractical for acute situations when a more rapid test is crucial. Nevertheless, further prospective studies may be required to ascertain whether fresh specimen inoculation would be better as a marker of HRSV current infection.",

This suggests that a significant propor-tion of children with HRSV-caused illness also had true co-infections by other viruses. While highly sensitive RT-PCR assays enable the co-detection of trace amounts of viral nucleic acids, including possible vestiges of past infections, authentic co-infections between two replicating respiratory viruses may also occur with non-negligible frequency [Arruda et al., 1991] . Further studies based on testing for markers of active replication of other respiratory viruses will be required to establish the proportion of true viral co-infections in patients shedding viable HRSV.",

This is in agreement with other studies done with samples positive for HRSV just by RT-PCR [Canducci et al., 2008; Nascimento et al., 2010; De Paulis et al., 2011] . The effects of detecting HAdV, HRV, HEV, HBoV, and HMPV on disease severity phenotype were also evaluated. With the exception of a higher frequency of coryza found in patients who shed viable HRSV and also had HRV by RT-PCR, no other significant differences in disease phenotype were noted among HRSV patient groups co-infected with other specific viruses. Coryza is a frequent and bothersome symptom of HRV infection, and it was interesting that more coryza was noted in children shedding viable HRSV who also had HRV detected by RT-PCR. This suggests that the codetection of HRV was associated with actual concurrent HRV replication in the upper respiratory tract of children with HRSV disease.",
