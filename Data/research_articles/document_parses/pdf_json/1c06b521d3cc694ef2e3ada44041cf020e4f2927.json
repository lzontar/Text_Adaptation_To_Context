The available epidemic curves for SARS show marked differences between the affected regions with respect to the total number of cases and epidemic duration, even for those regions in which outbreaks started almost simultaneously and similar control measures were implemented at the same time. The authors developed a likelihood-based estimation procedure that infers the temporal pattern of effective reproduction numbers from an observed epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction numbers were obtained by applying this estimation procedure to available data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various affected regions were characterized by markedly similar disease transmission potentials and similar levels of effectiveness of control measures.

The use of a likelihood framework provides a set of powerful tools for inference, uncertainty analysis, and model selection (20) ; the use of only time of symptom onset allows us to apply this method to routinely collected epidemic-curve data. However, estimation of effective reproduction numbers from epidemic curves has an intrinsic limitation that should be kept in mind: The effective reproduction number contains entangled information about the transmission potential (i.e., the basic reproduction number) and the effectiveness of control measures. These two components can be disentangled only when we obtain additional information-for example, about the time of implementation of control measures. Moreover, individual contributions to the effective reproduction number are entangled if their date of symptom onset is smaller than the generation interval.

A first lesson from the several SARS epidemics is that a timely alert against a new infectious disease is most essential. Our analysis suggests that the control measures implemented prevented approximately three quarters of all potential secondary infections; this may be insufficient to stop another new infectious disease.
