It is shown that such a simple model adequately reproduces the epidemic dynamics not only qualitatively but for a number of countries quantitatively with a high degree of correlation that allows to use it for predictive estimations. In addition, some features of SIR model are discussed in the context, how its parameters and conditions reflect measures attempted for the disease growth prevention that is also clearly indicated by deviations from such model solutions.",

However, it should be pointed out that detailed models, which include a lot of variable parameters require, respectively a detailed statistics for their validation. This is, for example, the case of Chinese outbreak, where the larger specification of affecting factors and decease statistics is available [5] [6] [7] [8] but for the rest of the world, the available data variety is quite limited. The last fact argues in favour of simple models, in majority regressions and compartmental ones. Among the last, one can mention variants of SEIR and SIR(D) models. e.g. [9] [10] [11] [12] . At the same time, even such models considered directly in E-mail addresses: postnikov@kursksu.ru , postnicov@gmail.com their original differential form contain more parameters than directly available information for their determining that argues that the reduction of variable and parameters number may be preferable, see the discussion in [12] . On the other hand, the pure logistic growth fitting applied ad hoc simply as a probable regression for the expected sigmoid curve described the total number of infected persons leads to controversial and uncertain results, e.g. [13] [14] [15] , that indicates an oversimplification when the fitting model does not have a clear linking to the epidemiological model background.",

Such behaviour is not only typical for the logistic regression [23] but also has an explanation based on the model's constructions: comparing Eqs. (4) and (7) one can see that both r and K depend on one parameter 0 reciprocally. Whence, the decay of r from 0.209 down to 0.183 is not connected with the actual reducing the averaged contact rate (this case would result in the changing shape of the rate's bell curve as in the case of China that is not observed in the case of Italy) but with the sequential better and better adjustment of the logistic curve to the longer and longer time series of data.

This method not only gives a range of predicted values, which is wider for less warrant early forecast and squeezes to the purely fitted value when the processed sample gets longer, but also propose some criteria for estimating relevance of the extrapolation. In particular, there is visible trend in the displacement of the predicting extrapolation of the simple fitting to the lower boundary of the prediction uncertainty defined by the Monte Carlo method. An explanation of this trend is based on the better relevance of the fitting for the data, which are in the regime of decelerating growth, i.e. the rate maximum is behind. Thus, the uncertainty in the data, which will be added, lead to the possible growth of the cumulative variable considered. On the contrary, before the rate maximum both uncertain results are possible, over-fitting as well as under-fitting.

In particular, the proven interrelation between r and K parameters indicates that the diminishing of r during the outbreak can originate not from reducing contact rate but principally from the better regression accuracy when the time series get longer and take into account the normal effect of deceleration characterising the full interval of the outbreak. Simultaneously, this provides an opportunity to estimate the quality of the logistic curve-based forecast and its uncertainty more warrantly.",

This is a reason why only such plots are given for different countries in Fig. 3 . In addition, the length of data series grows daily; therefore more and more accurate estimations will be available but their possibility is assured namely by this form of data and model representation.",
