We therefore clarified the characteristics of hPIV4 in Korea. Method: From January 2013 to December 2017, children admitted with respiratory tract infection at the Department of Pediatrics in Chung-Ang University Hospital were enrolled in the study. Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were obtained from patients and tested for hPIV types by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We retrospectively reviewed subject medical records, focusing on epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Results: Of the 12 423 NPA specimens, 8,406 were positive by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for nine respiratory viruses, and 1,018 were positive for one of the four types of hPIV: 1,018 specimens led to the detection of 1,029 hPIVs; 3ss (31.3%) were positive for hPIV1, 120 (11.7%) were positive for hPIV2, 356 (34.6%) were positive for hPIV3, and 231 (22.4%) were positive for hPIV4. Of the hPIV-positive patients, the mean age was 2.3 years (range, 0.1-12.7 years), 225 (97.4%) had no underlying disease, and 178 (77.1%) had a fever with a duration of 4.1 AE 2.3 days and a peak temperature of 39.0 AE 0.7\u00b0C. The most common diagnosis in hPIV4 infection was pneumonia (44.2%), followed by bronchiolitis (26.0%) and upper respiratory tract infection (24.3%). Only 2.2% of patients were diagnosed with croup. Although the most prevalent overall type of hPIV was hPIV3, hPIV4 generally caused acute respiratory tract infection in summer and early fall in an irregular annual pattern.

In previous studies, hPIV1 infections are usually detected in the fall of odd-numbered years; hPIV2 infections do not exhibit a clear seasonal pattern but occur more commonly in autumn. 8, 11, 12 There are generally more cases of hPIV3 in spring and early summer each year. 5, 8, [11] [12] [13] However, hPIV4 usually occurs during late autumn and winter in temperate countries, 5, 11, 13 but in China, hPIV4 is more often observed during spring and summer. 14 The seasonal patterns of hPIV4 have not been well clarified because of the small number of samples and the small number of studies that have been conducted. 5, 8, 12 As a result, more studies in diverse countries are needed to understand the global characteristics of hPIV4. The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) observed respiratory pathogens from patients with ARTI as part of the Korean Influenza and Respiratory Surveillance System (KIN-RESS) project, beginning in May 2009. The results of a KCDC study about the types of hPIVs were published in 2017. The authors could not determine the prevalence of hPIV4 in that study because they used the mRT-PCR panel without hPIV4. 15 Studies of hPIV4 infection in Korea are thus needed to understand the clinical characteristics and epidemiology in clinical areas. During our study period, the prevalence among hPIV types was highest in hPIV3, followed by hPIV1 and hPIV4. hPIV4 was the most frequent hPIV type in 2015 and the second most common type in 2014 (Table 2 ). In many countries, hPIV2 is less frequently detected than hPIV1 or hPIV3. 16, 17 One study showed that hPIV4 was more frequently detected than hPIV2, suggesting that hPIV4 might be underestimated as a pathogen of ARTI. 18 In this study, the 5-year period prevalence of hPIV2 was lower than that of hPIV4 (1.9%, 231/12 423) and was observed to be 1.0% (120/12 423), which was the lowest detection rate among hPIV types. hPIV4 infection accounted for 22.4% (231/1,029) of total hPIV infections in the current study.
