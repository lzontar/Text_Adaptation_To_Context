According to the 2019 Social Progress Index (based on multiple indicators showing several social metrics, such as health care and basic medical attention), Nicaragua ranked 103th among 149 countries, with a score of 58.97/100. Government health expenditure in 2017 was five percent of its GDP, distributed among three public institutions: the Ministry of Health, the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute, and the Defense Ministry. In terms of infrastructure to face this pandemic, Nicaragua has 0.9 hospital beds per 1000 inhabitants (compared to 2.2 for Latin America and the Caribbean at large) and an estimated stock of 160 ventilators, of which 80 percent are currently in use [4] . Given the country' s poverty, scarce resources must be judiciously employed -and so government policies are all-important.",

Restrictions to civil society institutions limit the ability to identify potential COVID-19 cases and to report to national and international observers. The motivation for controlling information is perceived to be for political reasons. As one Nicaraguan doctor says, \"When the government controls information about the virus, it does so to calm fears among Nicaraguans that they are at risk\" (personal communication, April 29, 2020). The doctor reports, too, that he is constrained: \"If I want to keep my position [as a doctor], I must do what the government says.\" Another doctor, one working in a rural part of the country, suggests that in the countryside there are even more constraints for health professionals than those faced in urban areas; she reports, \"If I tell someone they should stay indoors I am considered to be part of the political opposition\" (personal communication, April 29, 2020). She and other health professionals, feel intimidated. There is no public discussion in Nicaragua of how the country should respond to the pandemic; the country's response is decided by Ortega and Murillo, and seemingly based on what serves their desire to retain absolute political control of the country.",

In addition to multiple human rights violations reported in Nicaragua since the conflict started, the country' s economy showed a 4.0 and 3.9 percent decrease in its GDP in 2018 and 2019, respectively [9] . Ortega justified the absence of quarantine by publicly stating, \"We have not stopped working because if we stop working, the country dies, and if the country dies, the people die\" [8] . According to the World Bank' s revised economic forecast for 2020including the COVID-19 effects -Nicaragua will face its third consecutive year of economic recession with a 4.3 percent decrease in its GDP, badly hurting an economy that is already significantly weak.

Comparing their approach, both countries decided to keep their economies open, but in the case of Sweden, the government closed all activities related to the educational sector and banned large gatherings. The Nicaraguan government, instead, kept schools and universities open -only closing them for two weeks due to Easter celebrations -and promoted cultural events across the country. Just as importantly, Sweden has an explicit health policy -herd immunity. Sweden' s ambassador to the US has stated as much in an interview given on April 26: \"The country's controversial strategy of pursuing 'herd immunity' -and not locking down the country -is bearing success, with the capital Stockholm on course to reach herd immunity in the next few weeks\" [10] . Nothing Ortega or Murillo have said, though, suggests that they are shaping Nicaragua' s response to the pandemic based on a desire to build herd immunity. Instead, their public utterances suggest the same determination to maintain political support for their regime as led Ortega and Murillo to repress savagely protests against their rule in 2018 and 2019, even to the point of using snipers to assassinate unarmed student protestors [11] .",

The difference in the number of cases could be expected, considering that the population in Sweden (10.2 million) almost doubles that one of Norway (5.3 million) and Denmark (5.8 million). However, the number of deaths shows a disproportionate difference with mortality rates of 12.3, 2.7, and 5.1 percent for Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, respectively. Nicaragua, on the other hand, is reporting lower numbers of COVID-19 cases (15) and deaths (five) in comparison with neighboring countries such as Costa Rica (765 cases and six deaths) and Honduras (1461 cases and 99 deaths). Population sizes and mortality rates also vary within these three countries. With populations of 6.5 million in Nicaragua, 5.0 in Costa Rica, and 9.6 in Honduras, the corresponding mortality rates are 33.3, .78, and 6.77 percent. It is clear from these figures that Nicaragua has a disproportionately high mortality rate (according to official statistics). The fear, including among Nicaraguan health professionals, is 2-fold: 1) that official statistics are grossly manipulated for political reasons, and 2) that mortality might sharply increase because Ortega and Murillo refuse to recognize the seriousness of the crisis.",

Nicaragua' s northern neighbors, El Salvador and Honduras are worried about Nicaragua' s disregard for the threat posed by the pandemic, concerned that sooner or later, the highly infectious disease will be spread by Nicaraguans crossing their porous borders. In both El Salvador and Honduras, borders have been closed, and the population has been directed to quarantine itself. These two developing countries thus have followed, in contrast to Nicaragua, the recommendations of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Besides, in both countries, the medical profession has a voice in shaping public policies for addressing COVID-19. Still, there are worries that the presidents of both countries seek to exploit the crisis for political gain. A doctor in El Salvador states, \"President Nayib Bukele is utilizing the COVID-19 crisis to increase his power and to be more authoritarian in running the country\" (personal communication, April 28, 2020). The president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, is unpopular and is judged to be using curfews to quell public protests. A doctor in Honduras worries, too, that even in an emergency threatening public health, essential medical supplies can be fodder for corruption (personal communication, April 30, 2020). Politics is not everything in the developing countries of Central America, but it never seems very far from the surface. A simple comparison of four of the five countries of Central America (leaving out Guatemala), suggests the better the country is governed, the more rational, and coherent, is its response to the COVID-19 threat, with Costa Rica being at one end of the spectrum, and Nicaragua at the other end of the spectrum (with El Salvador and Honduras in the middle). This outcome is not surprising, but economic development in the region overlaps this political spectrum: Nicaragua is the poorest country in Central America and so the least able to afford an irrational strategy for managing the COVID-19.",

A cynical view, but one entertained by health professionals in Nicaragua, is that government restrictions on economic activity would lead to Ortega and Murillo being blamed for hardship, but that the slow, steady death of individual Nicaraguans, here and there throughout the country, would just be perceived by Nicaraguans as the course of nature.
