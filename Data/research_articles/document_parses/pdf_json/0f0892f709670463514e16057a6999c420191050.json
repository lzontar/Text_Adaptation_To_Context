If we are guided by our textbooks, we should look to the radiation of Darwin's finches (Grant and Grant 2008) , the return of whales to the water (Thewissen 1998), the evolution of modern horses from their tiny ancestors (MacFadden 2005) , or some similar well-established example for a case study. But are these sorts of illustrations the most compelling to students? Though such classic examples of evolution have more than earned their keep in the biology classroom, they are also removed from students' everyday lives. Hyracotherium, for example, may fascinate some students but leave others wondering why they need to know this stuff. Just how relevant is a 50-million-year-old horse to a 14-year-old's fastpaced media-driven world?",

Using examples with direct links to students' lives may raise their interest in the topic (Hillis 2007) , increase their motivation to learn (National Research Council 2003) , and encourage them to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math careers (STEM), as urgently recommended to bolster America's scientific and technological infrastructure (Project Kaleidoscope 2006) . Unfortunately, bringing current issues and events into the science classroom is often a challenge. Textbooks aim to keep up with advances in the field, but they are often thwarted by the rapid pace at which science moves. Scientific journals that describe cutting-edge, relevant evolutionary research come out daily-but it is difficult for most science teachers to translate these often complex and jargon-filled articles into something appropriate for the classroom. And, at the most basic level, the concerns and issues of interest to students and society are continually evolving. By the time that instructors have access to science teaching materials leveraging student interest in, for example, an emerging virus like swine flu or SARS, the threat and interest level are likely to have waned. How is a teacher to keep up?",

Some Evo in the News briefs cover a hot topic in evolutionary research that has made it into the popular press in the preceding month (e.g., the discovery of Tiktaalik or new research on the origins of HIV; Daeschler et al. 2006; Worobey et al. 2008) . In these cases, Evo in the News provides an explanation of the research in student-friendly terms, addresses the basic evolutionary concepts behind the research, and explains its relevance and importance. Of course, when some outlets in the popular media distort or misrepresent evolutionary research (e.g., when the discovery of a new hominid fossil is erroneously heralded as \"challenging evolutionary theory\"; Borenstein 2007; Spoor et al. 2007 ), Evo in the News explains the science behind the hype and why particular evolutionary issues are likely to be misinterpreted. Other news briefs address issues in the news that do not at first seem to have anything to do with evolution to reveal the \"evolution behind the scenes\"-which frequently gets short shrift in the popular press. For example, during National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Evo in the News provided an evolutionary perspective on cancer; after major methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreaks, Evo in the News explained the evolution of this bacterial strain; and when six medical workers were sentenced to death in a Libyan trial, Evo in the News dealt with the evolutionary evidence that should have exonerated them. All concepts and news stories addressed are appropriate for high school, advanced placement biology, and/or college biology classes.",

In a formative evaluation of the program (Rockman et al. 2005) , teachers reported that they were likely to use Evo in the News in their classrooms but that the utility of the briefs could be improved with study questions and additional support materials. In response, discussion questions and links to supporting lessons, activities, and readers were added. In a small-scale survey of the podcast component of Evo in the News, both teacher and students gave the podcast a positive rating but reported preferring shorter podcasts. In response, podcast length has been adjusted. A more formal assessment of Evo in the News is currently underway in collaboration with the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, School of Education. It aims to assess the accessibility of the program, its effectiveness at increasing student understanding of evolutionary concepts, and its effectiveness at communicating the relevance of evolutionary theory.
