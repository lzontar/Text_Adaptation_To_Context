Dates two weeks prior to respective case dates were chosen to account for 14 days between transmission and case confirmation. As shown in fig. 2 , recorded mean maximum temperature values were averaged across each reported latitude for each day and assigned to reporting nations based on modeled population latitudes. For data reported March 27, 2020, multiple linear regression analysis 12 was then performed for confirmed cases at the national level using estimated populations and mean maximum temperatures at assigned latitudes as predictors. Case data was transformed using the Box-Cox 14 method with \u03bb = 0. To reduce variance, populations were then binned 11 into 5 o latitude and temperature ranges set at 2.5 o intervals. Multiple linear regression was then performed for confirmed cases binned by latitude, again using population and mean maximum temperature as predictors, with and without a categorical variable describing bins above and below 30 o latitude. Confirmed case data binned by latitude was transformed, again using the Box-Cox method, with \u03bb = 0.212028 for analysis including the categorical variable and \u03bb = 0 for analysis without.
