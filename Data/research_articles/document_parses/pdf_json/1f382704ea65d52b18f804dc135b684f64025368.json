We distinguished between high-risk and low-risk members of the population, and modeled di\u21b5erences in social interactions due to context, risk level, infection status, and testing status. The model incorporates many of the currently important characteristics of the disease, including overcapacity in the healthcare system and uncertainties surrounding the proportion and transmission potential of asymptomatic cases. We compared current policy guidelines from public health agencies with alternative options, and investigated the e\u21b5ects of policy decisions on the overall proportion of COVID-19-related deaths. Our results support current policies to contain the outbreak but also suggest possible refinements, including emphasizing the need to reduce public, random contacts more than private contacts, and testing low-risk symptomatic individuals before high-risk symptomatic individuals. Our model furthermore points to interactions among the three policy domains; the e cacy of a particular policy choice depends on other implemented policies. Finally, our results provide an explanation for why societies like Germany, with lower average rates of social contact, are more successful at containing the outbreak than highly social societies such as Italy, despite the implementation of similar policy measures.",

The WHO named the disease COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and declared the outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of the time of this writing, , the WHO has reported 2,241,359 confirmed cases and 152,551 deaths in 210 countries [1] . There is currently no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and no antiviral medication that specifically targets the virus. In response to the pandemic, public health organizations have deployed plans developed to respond to a possible pandemic similar to the influenza outbreak of 1918, which killed an estimated 50 million people world-wide [2] . These plans describe, among other things, policies related to social distancing and the allocation of scarce healthcare resources. Policy guidelines for testing individuals for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 are less well-developed, and a shortage of available tests and testing facilities has hampered response e\u21b5orts in many countries.",

Guidelines are based on ethical principles and societal norms, and governing principles generally include the duty to care and the duty to treat people fairly. Strategies for determining who will receive scarce resources include: 1) first-come first-served, 2) randomized allocation (e.g., lottery), and 3) clinical judgment [12] [13] [14] . The purpose of these guidelines is to relieve individual clinicians of the burden of deciding on-the-spot how to allocate resources.",

Considering policy domains together can provide crucial insight into how di\u21b5erent policy decisions interact. For example, a mandatory quarantine of symptomatic individuals combined with an e cient testing regime may reduce the total number of deaths more than would be expected if the e\u21b5ects of these policies were modeled individually. Policies can also interfere with each other, so that the combined e\u21b5ect is weaker than expected.

We considered a closed population, and given the short time frame also chose not to include birth, deaths, or migration events. We distinguished between two types of interactions: First, private (local) interactions (e.g., friends, school and work colleagues) were modeled using a Watts-Strogatz small-world network with average connectivity of k neighbors and 5% probability of edge rewiring (Fig. 1a) . (Edge rewiring refers to the replacement of edges in a regular network according to a stochastic algorithm so that properties of small-world networks, such as clustering and short path lengths, are achieved [32] .) Second, public (global) interactions (e.g., grocery shopping, banking) were modeled using a fully connected network [33] . We assumed that, in the absence of an epidemic, an individual has on average the same number of k private and k public interactions, and thus assigned a weight of k/(N 1) to each edge in the public interaction network. A multi-national study found, on average, between 8 and 20 per-person per-day contacts [9] , so we considered k 2 {4, 6 (baseline), 10}.",

Susceptible individuals become infected (and transition to the exposed compartment E) through contact with contagious individuals. Contrary to SARS [35] , recent reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted before the onset of symptoms and by asymptomatic cases [36] [37] [38] . To account for this early transmissibility in our model, individuals in compartments E, A, I and H may all transmit the virus, with transmission rates dependent on the time since infection. We assumed that exposed individuals (compartment E) become contagious 2 days before peak viral load, which coincides with symptom onset in symptomatic cases (i.e., the latent period is two days shorter than the incubation period). Transmission rates over time typically follow a Gamma distribution [39] . Based on preliminary data [40] , we used a Gamma-distributed transmission rate with shape=2 and scale=2 (Fig. 1c) . We further assumed that asymptomatic cases cannot be more contagious than symptomatic ones. SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates are currently not well understood [29] , so we considered a range of values for the peak transmission rate of symptomatic cases (at symptom onset), I 2 U (0.05, 0.4) and a dependent range for asymptomatic ones, A 2 U (0, I ).",

Remaining available tests are administered to symptomatic individuals (compartment I), and a shortage of tests precludes testing of individuals without symptoms (compartments S, E, A, and R). We compared two primary testing policies for symptomatic individuals: (i) test high-risk individuals first, or (ii) test low-risk individuals first.

This approach works particularly well for the triage policies as triage choices do not a\u21b5ect the model until hospitals operate at overcapacity. To compare primary and secondary testing policies (Fig. 4c) we followed the same approach, except that we sampled from a lower-dimensional parameter space.

At the time of this writing, Italy has su\u21b5ered devastating e\u21b5ects from COVID-19 while Germany has weathered the pandemic relatively well. Because of the cultural di\u21b5erences in social connectivity, if Germany and Italy (for example) both reduce their contacts by the same percentage, Germany will avert a higher percentage of deaths. Our results suggest that more social societies must reduce their contacts more in order to attain the same level of reduction, and that a potentially fruitful avenue for future research might investigate whether these results hold more broadly across di\u21b5erent cultures.",

Under this framework, our results indicate that prioritizing the testing of low-risk individuals more e\u21b5ectively reduces the overall death count than prioritizing the testing of high-risk individuals. Low-risk individuals have higher contact rates than high-risk individuals [9] , so reducing the social activity of infected low-risk individuals slows the spread of the disease.

These homogeneities may explain the bimodal posterior distribution of the proportion of infected individuals (Fig. S2) . Future studies may reveal if and how our results might change in more realistic interaction networks [57] , which may include temporal movement of individuals [58] , age-assortative mixing [21, 30] , or the presence of individual-based heterogeneity in risk behavior.",

The goal of our study is not to report model predictions such as the expected absolute number of deaths; rather, our model is a tool that can be used, despite the uncertainty in key parameters, to compare the e cacy of various policies aimed at reducing the societal impact of COVID-19. We have focused on relative comparisons of three policy domains, as relative findings are more robust to inaccuracies in the underlying parameter space.",

Importantly, the model can be easily expanded and updated as more details about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 emerge. Our results support current policies to contain the outbreak and suggest possible refinements to public health policy and education. Our results also provide a possible explanation for why some societies are more successful at containing the outbreak despite the implementation of similar policy measures.
