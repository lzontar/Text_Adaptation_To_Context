Dynamic parameters were recorded before proning and every 30 min during the session until 24 h. 103 patients (ARDS 95%) were included performing 231 PP sessions with a mean length of 21.5 \u00b1 5 h per session. They presented a significant increase in pH, static compliance and P a O 2 /F i O 2 with a significant decrease in P a CO 2 , P plat , phase 3 slope of the volumetric capnography, P et CO 2 , V D /V T-phy and \u0394P. The beneficial physiological effects continued after 16 h of PP and at least up to 24 h in some patients. The evolution of the respiratory parameters during the first session and also during the pooled sessions did not find any predictor of response to PP, whether before, during or 2 h after the return in SP.",

PP was not performed in case of severe hemodynamic instability (life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia, vasopressor > 2 \u00b5g/ kg/min) or withdrawal of life sustaining treatments. The PP procedure was completely protocolized (protocol available in Additional file 1). The sessions could be interrupted before 16 h in case of urgent care (CT, surgery, cardiac arrest, etc.). Otherwise the return to the supine position was made after at least 16 h, if P a O 2 /F i O 2 > 150 and if the staff was completely available. Prone position therapy was stopped when P a O 2 /F i O 2 remained above 150 in SP. Mechanical ventilation was delivered in a controlled ventilation mode, either in volume or in pressure. Expiratory tidal volume (VT e ) had to be adjusted between 5 and 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight. PEEP was set to achieve an end-inspiratory plateau pressure (P plat ) between 28 and 30 cmH 2 O (or more if an esophageal pressure probe was used to titrate PEEP according to inspiratory and/or expiratory transpulmonary pressure) [26] . Respiratory rate (RR) was set to maintain an arterial plasma pH of 7.20 to 7.45 without an increase in intrinsic PEEP.",

Pulmonary mechanics, data from volumetric capnography and arterial blood gas were recorded before prone positioning, 2 h after proning, before return in SP and 2 h after return in SP. Static values were recorded and calculated at these steady-state periods. Additionally end-tidal CO 2 pressure (P et CO 2 ), dynamic compliance (C dyn ), VT e , physiological Bohr dead space (V D /V T-phy ) and phase 3 slope of the volumetric capnography (S III ) were recorded before proning and every 30 min during the PP session (until 24 h of PP). S III of volumetric capnography is a plateau phase corresponding to the emptying of the alveolar compartment. The more flat the slope (i.e., close to 0), the more the alveoli have a simultaneous emptying and an identical CO 2 concentration (therefore similar ventilation/perfusion ratios). The increase in the slope will thus be associated with a desynchronization of the alveolar emptying and/or an increase in the inhomogeneity of the ventilation/perfusion ratios [27] . Dynamic driving pressure (\u0394P dyn ) was calculated by VT e /C dyn .",

            "text": "It has already been shown that the oxygenation gain estimated by the P a O 2 /F i O 2 was not associated with a reduction in mortality thanks to PP [30] . It is the same for all the other parameters studied here, although previous studies have found potentially prognostic parameters such as the decrease in P a CO 2 [31, 32] or alveolar dead space [32] . These results are in fact logical if one relies on the mechanism of action of prone positioning, which consists of a reduction of the VILI. PP reduces lung stress and strain by reducing the overdistention of anterior non-dependent zones while allowing recruitment of posterior dependent zones [7-9, 13, 14] . Lung expansion is more constant and homogeneous [10, 15, 16] . It should therefore be considered that putting on PP is an integral part of protective ventilation techniques such as reducing the VT. In the same way that the use of reduced current volumes should be applied until a significant improvement in ARDS allowing the reintroduction of spontaneous ventilation, PP sessions should probably be extended to a similar time. It has, again recently, been shown that the recruitment of posterior lung zones depends on the duration of positioning [33] . In our study the beneficial effect continued to increase after at least 24 h. Interestingly, the PROSEVA study [6] , the only positive randomized controlled trial, was the only one that did not stop PP therapy after a pre-established period, but continued until a significant (P a O 2 /F i O 2 > 150 in SP) and persistent (> 4 h) improvement occurred. It would seem reasonable to continually leave patients in PP until the overall improvement of their condition allows sedation to be stopped and spontaneous ventilation to resume. Rather than repeating the sessions, it would probably be better to extend the sessions. The beneficial effect is linked to the length spent in PP, not to the maneuver per se. Also, complications during turning maneuvers are rare in experienced teams, but probably more frequent in the smallest centers. If our study did not allow us to predict a benefit in extending the sessions for more than 24 h, it nevertheless invited us to make them last at least 24 h. It also does not seem logical to interrupt sessions, whose initiation was motivated by a P a O 2 /F i O 2 of less than 150, if this P a O 2 /F i O 2 remains below 150 after 24 h. Therefore, we suggest that the PP sessions last at least 24 h and be extended in the event that the P a O 2 /F i O 2 ratio at 24 h remains below 150.",

Most of these patients die, while still on mechanical ventilation, but rarely with refractory hypoxemia [34] . It is mainly the overcomplications, the sequelae of the causal disease and the maintenance of pulmonary lesions by the mechanical ventilation which prolong the duration of invasive ventilation and are responsible for the mortality. PP should not be used as a rescue, but as a routine therapy in ARDS patients. Yet a multicenter study in 2017 found that the prevalent reason for not using PP was that hypoxemia was not considered sufficiently severe [35] . Future studies should focus on researching the benefit of PP in all ARDS patients regardless of the severity stage. There were no life-threatening complications in our cohort and they are described as rare [6, 35] . The benefit/risk balance is therefore strongly in favor of the PP in moderate-to-severe ARDS. It should be evaluated in the mild-to-moderate ARDS. Of course, the PP session could be interrupted in the event of a serious complication or urgent care.",

Finally, the hemodynamic impact of PP has not been studied except via VCO 2-min and P (a-et) CO 2 . Indeed our study found an association between mortality and low CO 2 production. It was probably linked to a defect in cellular perfusion from circulatory failure. 101 (98.1%) of the patients were on vasopressors. This aspect is probably major, at least in patients with acute cor pulmonale [37, 38] . More studies are needed on this topic. In addition, the volumetric capnography data are significantly affected by the hemodynamic state of the patient, which makes their interpretation more difficult.",

Therefore, we suggest that the PP sessions last at least 24 h and be extended in the event that the P a O 2 /F i O 2 ratio at 24 h remains below 150. In the event of a relapse of the P a O 2 / F i O 2 ratio below 150 after putting back in supine position, a new session of at least 24 h of PP should be carried out, and so on until the moment of deciding to stop sedation and resume spontaneous ventilation. PP should be integrated into the protective ventilation of moderateto-severe ARDS in the same way as the reduction in tidal volume.",
