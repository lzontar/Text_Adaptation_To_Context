The most common symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue and headache. Overall, 343 patients (63.5%) were hospitalised, 49 (9.1%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 14 (4.1%) died. Case fatality rates were highest (9.1%) in those aged 65 years or older. Factors significantly associated with a higher risk for ICU admission included age, neurological disease, adipositas, and both interstitial pathology and lobular pathology on chest X-ray. No association with pregnancy, malignancy or immunosuppressive therapy was detected. Antiviral treatment significantly reduced the duration of fever by 0.66 days and lowered the risk of ICU admission, but had no significant benefit on survival. Conclusions During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, elderly or obese patients and those with neurological disease had an increased risk for severe H1N1 infection in On behalf of the Austrian Clinical Influenza Study Group.

Early reports of disproportionately high mortality in young adults in Mexico [1] followed after various reports of pandemic type A (H1N1) influenza infections with variable disease severity but lower overall mortality than that of the initial Mexican epidemic [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the influenza pandemic alert to level 6, the highest level, on the basis of the widespread incidence of H1N1 cases observed globally, while noting that the current pandemic could be characterised as moderate in severity [8] . The virus of this influenza pandemic, the first in the 21st century, appeared to primarily affect children, young adults and pregnant woman, as well as those with underlying lung or cardiac disease conditions [9] .",

In the initial phase of the pandemic in Austria, all cases of H1N1 infection were associated with travel and autochthonous transmission was widely impeded [11] , although this might have been due to factors in addition to the control measures [12] .",

Likelihood ratio tests were used to test for linear effects and model improvement. We aimed at the most parsimonious model. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess goodness of model fit for the final model. We used web-based data collection and found considerable item non-response, rendering reasonable multivariate modelling impossible. However, it is reasonable to assume that pathological conditions were reported and that item non-response could be mainly explained by the absence of the specific condition. This is obvious for pathologies observed on chest X-rays and evident for pregnancy, where no input option was provided for male cases. Thus, missing values were not random and it appeared reasonable to assume that they equated to absence of the specific condition and, therefore, were set at zero for the multivariable analysis.",

Presentation with mild or moderate symptoms was frequent among the 15 pregnant women in our series, although rapid clinical progression and deterioration did occur: one woman in the third trimester with diabetes mellitus and respiratory failure required a Caesarean section, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation for 21 days. In our analysis, pregnancy was not associated with a higher hospitalisation rate or the need for ICU admission. No data are available on the rate of H1N1 vaccination among pregnant women in Austria.",

In the present analysis, concomitant laboratory-confirmed bacterial pneumonia was reported in only nine patients, the most common pathogen isolated being S. pneumoniae. These findings might lead to the perception that bacterial coinfections played a limited role during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. On the other hand, a recent study on bacterial pneumonia in fatal cases of the pandemic indicates that, as observed during previous influenza pandemics, bacterial pneumonia considerably contributed to death [39] . Thus, a low number of clinically documented bacterial lung infections might reflect the difficulty of establishing specific bacterial diagnoses in persons with suspected bacterial coinfection rather than reflecting a truly low incidence [40] . Accordingly, in the present analysis, 14.6% of the hospitalised patients, 42.9% of the patients requiring intensive care and 38.5% of fatal cases had a clinical diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Our data suggest that bacterial lung infections occurred among patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection and may underline the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for persons at increased risk of pneumococcal pneumonia.",
