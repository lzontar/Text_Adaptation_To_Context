Clinical practice should be adapted to protect both patients and healthcare workers. In the face of this unprecedented situation, scientific societies are required to publish recommendations without delay to aid practitioners in their decision making [2] . The SARS-CoV-2 virus is mostly found in the upper airways, with high viral loads in the nasal cavities and the oral cavity [3] . Any ENT diagnostic or therapeutic procedure therefore carries a risk of spreading the virus and contaminating the healthcare team. This risk seems to be particularly high in the field of rhinology and endoscopic endonasal surgery [4, 5] . Clinical examination and invasive procedures on the nasal cavities and connected cavities (sinus, nasopharynx, skull base) expose people to direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by inhalation of contaminated droplets or projections to the eyes, or by indirect transmission when touching contaminated hands, surfaces or objects [6] . This article has been written by a college of specialist rhinologists under the aegis of the following French scientific societies: the French ENT Society (SFORL), French Rhinology Association (AFR), French ENT College, French ENT National Union (SNORL), and French National Professional ENT Council (CNPORL). Its aim is to help rhinologists adapt their clinical practice. This advice may need to change according to the health situation.",

FFP2 masks have a particle penetration rate of only 6%, and the maximum leakage rate around the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f face and nose is 8% [9]. In the United Kingdom, some authors even recommend use of an FFP3 mask [10] . FFP3 have a particle penetration rate of only 1%, and the maximum leakage rate around the face and nose is 2%. After use, the flexible or rigid endoscope must be decontaminated immediately in accordance with the protocol currently used in the institution.",

It is recommended that patients continue to use their regular medication, especially corticosteroids used as a nasal spray or personal inhalers. Intranasal corticosteroids may be newly prescribed if there is no alternative. However, the use of antihistamine sprays and anticholinergic sprays should be preferred whenever possible, as well as oral antihistamines.

Nasal endoscopy is only useful for nosebleeds if a haemorrhagic tumour is suspected. This does not apply to COVID-19+ patients and it induces a very high risk of airborne contamination for the operator. Anticoagulated patients should have a contrast-CT straight away (if the nosebleed persists despite the use of a balloon catheter) with radioembolization as a priority, because endonasal surgery carries a very high risk of contaminating the operating staff: it is not therefore recommended in this situation.",
