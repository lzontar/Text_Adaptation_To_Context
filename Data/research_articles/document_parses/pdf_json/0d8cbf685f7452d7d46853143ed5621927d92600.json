While the internal examiner acknowledged a productive start to my PhD, there was concern that I was putting all my research eggs into a single basket. The one question that has stuck firmly in my mind since was: 'Have you considered what might happen if something completely unexpected derailed the clinical trial and, therefore, your research agenda?'",

' However, the same day in China, thousands of miles away from my Viva venue, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose by 1820 to 46 550, including 1368 deaths. Outside of China and closer to home, 11 out the 23 countries reporting COVID-19 cases were now reporting local transmission. The WHO's daily Situation Report pointed to a 'High Global Pandemic Risk Assessment'. 1 The rest is the history still being written each day. We will all have our own stories of how COVID-19 has impacted our lives and our plans. We will all have accounts of deferred or spoiled professional ambitions, or of trying to balance the competing pursuit of prior personal goals and answering to the call of national duty. These accounts will feel much less significant compared to the tragedy and loss felt by many, but they are important nonetheless, not least for what we may learn from them. Here is a perspective from the clinical research sector, from surgical training, and from the NHS Nightingale Hospital London.",

One of the early signs that everything was about to change was the closure of almost all the University's research offices with 36 hours' notice on the 20th March.Shortly after this, the University Hospital's Joint Research Office suspended all non-COVID-19 essential research. This was entirely appropriate but an enormous shock nonetheless, and something which, at one of the largest cancer research hospitals in the country, would have been unthinkable even a fortnight prior. The anticipated message to the small army of research staff was to expect COVID-19 redeployment imminently.",

They are tasked with trying to guide a response that can meet the competing demands of 'minimising the spread of infection, promoting personal and patient safety, maintaining normal processes where possible, [whilst understanding] the need for pragmatism'. 3 The ongoing uncertainty and upheaval for trainees has meant suspension of normal rotations, postponement of the MRCS examination, cancellation of all FRCS examinations, remote delivery of all ARCPs, and most remarkably of all, conversion of the ST3 national selection process into a self-assessment questionnaire with no central evidence checking or score validation.",

For the trainees who have participated in these changes with steadfastness and good humour, they may or may not see it now but new chapters in the organisation and management of training are being drafted with every day that passes. Indeed, new chapters in the history of the NHS and even healthcare across the globe are now being written. It is important that new training frameworks emphasise respect for autonomy, recognition of competence and prioritisation of relatedness. 4 Surgical trainees will deserve a seat at these discussions as a result of their actions during the pandemic.",
