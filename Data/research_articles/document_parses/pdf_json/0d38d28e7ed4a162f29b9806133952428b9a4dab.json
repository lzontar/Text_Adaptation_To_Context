Cytokines are key modulators of the immune and infl ammatory responses functioning in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner stimulating or suppressing cellular activities in infection, innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, infl ammation, and malignancy. Key to an understanding of these regulatory proteins is the recognition of their pleiotropism and sometimes overlapping activities, functional redundancies, and side effects. Their secretion may be induced by an array of different stimuli associated with infection, infl ammation, or tumorigenesis, fi rst releasing waves of (for example) proinfl ammatory molecules followed by antiinfl ammatory cytokines to restore homeostasis. Cytokines therefore induce a diverse range of biological responses including proliferation, differentiation, activation, infl ammation, chemotaxis, and cell death and the nature of an immune or infl ammatory stimulus determines whether an immune response is humoral-or cell-mediated, cytotoxic, immunosuppressive or allergic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The many attempts to classify cytokines over the last three decades and the complexities in devising classifi cations based on structural and/or functional parameters are not hard to understand given the sheer number of imprecisely defi ned \"factors\" identifi ed in the early years and the diffi culties and work involved in trying to accumulate details on functions and diseases. In their discussion of the evolution of cytokine biology and 218 nomenclature, Steinke and Borish draw attention to three phases of development in the identifi cation and classifi cation of cytokines. The identifi cation of cytokines by their biologic activities (e.g., T-cell growth) occurred in the fi rst, or factor, stage. The production of recombinant cytokines and demonstration of their pleiotropism and redundancy led to much of our current understanding and this can be called the recombinant-cloning or second phase. Currently, we are experiencing the third, or genomic phase, where cytokines are being identifi ed on the basis of homology with known, characterized cytokines. In the more recent progressive assemblages published by Tato and Cua detailing each cytokine's receptor(s), source, targets, major function, and disease association, the fi rst 16 interleukins were grouped in order of their discovery. Many of these interleukins form homodimeric structures and have the \u03b3c and/or \u03b2c chains in their receptors. More recently discovered interleukins have proven more diffi cult to classify in relation to their function in health and disease due to the complexity of their heterodimeric ligands and receptors. For example, a homotrimeric motif for ligands and receptors and bidirectional signaling were found to be important features of the TNF family. Many original names are still in use and many of the originally described \"factors\" share receptors with other interleukins.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Here, we focus on the 23 FDA-approved cytokine products from the CDER-approved Biologic Products list. The cytokine classifi cation presented is based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes with input from Vacchelli et al. ( http://dx.doi. org/10.4161/onci.20459 ). Nine main families are recognized (Table 5 .1 ) with most of the cytokines of interest classifi ed in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon (IFN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) families. In the hematopoietin family, approved cytokines manufactured by recombinant DNA technology are aldesleukin (rh-interleukin-2 [IL-2]), oprelvekin (rhIL-11), fi lgrastim and tbo-fi lgrastim (rh-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]), sargramostim (rh-granulocyte macrophage [GM]-CSF), metreleptin (rh-leptin) and rh-erythropoietins, epoetin, and darbepoetin alfa. Anakinra, a recombinant receptor antagonist for IL-1, is a representative of the IL-1 cytokine family; recombinant interferons alfa-1, alfa-2, beta-1, and gamma-1 make up the interferon family; palifermin (rhkeratinocyte growth factor [KGF]) and becaplermin (rhPDGF-BB) are in the PDGF family; and rh-bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]-2 and rhBMP-7 represent the TGF\u03b2 family. Chemokines, placed here in group 9 (Table 5 .1 ), behave as regulatory molecules for leukocytes and lymphoid tissue and have an important role in infectious, infl ammatory, allergic and autoimmune responses as well as angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and tumor growth.

In fact, the literature on side effects to interferons is voluminous and probably greater than all the other approved, non-mAb biologics literatures put together. Three interferon alfa preparations are in the CDER Biologic Products List. Peginterferon alfa-2a together with the guanosine analog and nucleoside inhibitor, ribavirin (1-\u03b2-d -ribofuranosyl-1 H -1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxyamide Copegus \u00ae ; Fig. 5 .1 ) are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adults who have compensated liver disease and were not previously treated with interferon alfa. This drug combination is also the approved treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C and HIV and peginterferon alfa-2a alone is approved for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B who have compensated liver disease, viral replication, and liver infl ammation. Interferon alfa-2b is administered extensively for hepatitis B and C as well as several malignancies (Table 5 .2 ). It upregulates the expression of MHC I proteins enhancing activation of CD8+ T cells and cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated killing as well as inducing synthesis of several other antiviral agents including protein kinase R. Peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b are covalent conjugates of the recombinant interferon with a single branched bis-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, MW 40 kDa. Pegylation, which is FDA approved, nontoxic and contributes to water solubility, helps to protect the protein from immune recognition, that is, it reduces the immunogenicity and antigenicity and increases the molecule's size thus extending protein half-life and circulatory time and reducing renal clearance. For interferon alfa-2a, adverse events in patients treated with the pegylated form and ribavirin occur with a similar, or signifi cantly less, frequency than those treated with standard interferon/ribavirin. For interferon alfa-2b, a number of adverse events occur more frequently with pegylated interferon/ribavirin.

There is some evidence that the serotonergic system is involved in the pathophysiologic mechanism although the central opioid, dopamine, and glutamate neurotransmitter systems may also be involved. A positive correlation between depression scores and serum concentrations of soluble ICAM (intracellular adhesion molecule)-1 in patients who received interferon alfa led to the suggestion that the cytokine may induce the adhesion molecule which then increases the permeability of the blood-brain-barrier, allowing the interferon to more easily enter the brain.

Hematologic adverse effects, particularly anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia occur but are rarely severe or dose limiting. Thrombocytopenia is a common toxicity of high dose IL-2 therapy but rapidly reverses upon cessation of treatment.

Within hours of the fi rst dose, platelets and lymphocytes fall rapidly to low levels and eosinophil numbers rise slowly, whereas neutrophils and hemoglobin are maintained at stable levels. At the cessation of treatment, lymphocytes and platelets quickly return to normal and, in fact, may exceed their baseline levels by 2-to 5-fold. Eosinophils persist and may do so for many weeks. Endocrine effects usually manifest as hypothyroidism which may affect up to onethird of patients, or as the far less common hyperthyroidism.

The range of biological events set in motion even by individual cytokines, warns of the possibility of unwanted side effects and the resultant caution is refl ected by the relatively small number of cytokines currently approved by regulatory agencies and reviewed here. Good examples of the sort of doubts that exist and why clinical developments proceed so cautiously have been illustrated with interferons, aldesleukin, becaplermin, palifermin, and bone morphogenetic proteins. A glance at Table 5 .2 shows that 16 of the 23 listed FDA-approved cytokine preparations (19 different cytokines with four also in Concluding Remarks pegylated form) carry warnings with 10 of these being black box warnings. Having been used in human therapy for many years, interferon alfa preparations are well known for a number of often widely different, potentially serious side effects specifi ed in boxed warnings. The diverse nature of these side effects including neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, ischemic, and infection adverse events, together with their therapeutic benefi ts, provides a good illustration of the two-edged nature of cytokine pleiotropism. Becaplermin, a growth factor, causes cell proliferation so the possibility of malignancy with its continued use needs to be kept in mind, especially in patients with known cancers. Likewise, palifermin, another growth factor and a valuable treatment for mucositis in cancer patients, has with it the potential for stimulation of tumor growth, especially since its complementary receptors occur widely on many different cell types in the body. Aldesleukin, the recombinant IL-2, is a potent activator of T lymphocytes and stimulates immune responses to cancer, producing regression of tumors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. However, this activity can also lead to a range of adverse cardiac and pulmonary events. Perhaps, the best example of the safety uncertainties and benefi ts-to-risk ratios associated with these heterogeneous, pleiotropic cell regulators, is seen with the bone morphogenetic proteins BMP-2 and BMP-7. Already with a troubled history of underreported adverse events, in the postmarketing period, these growth factors are currently a focus of attention and speculation as potential carcinogens. BMP-2 receptors are expressed on some tumor cells and increased rates of cancer following its use have been reported but, in keeping with the complexity of cytokine-induced responses, and the diffi culty of ascribing many adverse effects to causes, tumor-suppressing effects, or no dependence, have also been reported.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 944, "end": 951, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Concluding Remarks"}, {"text": "In any consideration of adverse event profi les of approved biologics, two other potentially important contributing factors need to be recognized.

They are usually glycosylated and produced by a variety of different cells including those of the immune system, epithelia, endothelia, and stroma. Cytokines are key modulators of the immune and infl ammatory responses functioning in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner in infection, innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, infl ammation, and malignancy. Key to an understanding of these regulatory proteins is the recognition of their pleiotropism and sometimes overlapping activities, functional redundancies, and side effects. \u2022 In the current genomic phase, cytokines are identifi ed on the basis of homology with known, characterized cytokines. Many original names are still in use and many of the originally described \"factors\" share receptors with other cytokines, for example, some interleukins. \u2022 For the 23 FDA-approved cytokine products from the CDER-approved Biologic Products list, the cytokine classifi cation presented is based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. \u2022 Nine main families are recognized with most of the cytokines of interest classifi ed in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon (IFN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) families. The approved cytokines are manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. \u2022 Hematopoietin family: aldesleukin (rh-interleukin-2 [IL-2]), oprelvekin (rhIL-11), fi lgrastim and tbo-fi lgrastim (rh-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]), sargramostim (rh-granulocyte macrophage [GM]-CSF), metreleptin (rh-leptin), rh-erythropoietins, epoetin and darbepoetin alfa, and stem cell factor (r-met-hSCF); IL-1 cytokine family: anakinra, a recombinant receptor antagonist for IL-1; interferon family: recombinant interferons alfa-1, alfa-2, beta-1, and Summary gamma-1; PDGF family: palifermin (rh-keratinocyte growth factor [KGF] ) and becaplermin (rhPDGF-BB); and TGF\u03b2 family: rh-bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]-2 and rhBMP-7. \u2022 Interferons are a class of broad-spectrum antiviral cytokines with overlapping, but also some individual, activities. Of most interest for therapy are interferons alfa, beta, and gamma. Virtually all patients treated with interferon alfa experience some adverse effect(s) at some time during therapy. \u2022 Interferon alfa preparations occasionally provoke an extensive range of adverse reactions including cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, hematologic, metabolic, urinary tract, and skin adverse events as well as adverse effects on the nervous and sensory systems. \u2022 Peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b are covalent conjugates of the recombinant interferon with a single branched bis-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. Pegylation helps to protect the protein from immune recognition and increases the molecule's size thus extending protein half-life and circulatory time and reducing renal clearance. \u2022 Peginterferon alfa-2a together with ribavirin is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adults who have compensated liver disease and for patients infected with hepatitis C and HIV. Peginterferon alfa-2a alone is approved for patients with chronic hepatitis B. \u2022 Interferon alfa-2b is administered extensively for hepatitis B and C as well as several malignancies. \u2022 Interferon alfa-induced neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, cognitive dysfunction, and mania are well known and have been intensively studied. Of the patients who develop severe depressive symptoms, most occur within the fi rst 3 months of treatment. The incidence of depressive disorders is estimated to be 23-41 %. Symptoms may be prolonged for 6 months or more after the cessation of therapy. \u2022 Autoantibodies and development or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases including hypothyroidism, immune-mediated hemolysis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Raynaud's disease, and mixed connective tissue disease are known to occur in response to interferon alfa therapy. \u2022 Pegylated interferon alfa-2b has been associated with acute myocardial infarction, pericarditis, pericardial effusion with tamponade, and sick sinus syndrome producing arrhythmias. \u2022 Interstitial lung disease, reported for both interferon alfa-2a and 2b, is seen more frequently with the former agent and with high doses of the latter. Cases of fatal interstitial pneumonitis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) following pegylated interferon alfa-2b are known. \u2022

sclerosis, restless legs syndrome, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, and Bell's palsy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1970, "end": 1975, "text": "[KGF]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section":

Ocular complications include occlusive vasculitis, central retinal artery occlusion, anterior ischemic optic retinopathy, retinal hemorrhage, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and optic nerve edema. Other ocular complications described in patients treated with interferon alfa-2b include permanent loss of sight due to combined retinal artery and central retinal vein obstruction; development of an epiretinal membrane; and the T-cell-mediated autoimmune syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. \u2022 Endocrine effects of interferon alfa, best illustrated by thyroid dysfunction, may have an autoimmune mechanism. It occurs with an incidence of 5-14 % in patients treated for chronic hepatitis C. Hypothyroidism occurs more often than hyperthyroidism. Interferon alfa-2b can cause both conditions. \u2022 Neutropenia induced by interferon alfa is fairly commonly seen. Other hematologic side effects include acute and autoimmune thrombocytopenia, pernicious anemia, bone marrow hypoplasia which may be immune mediated, and pure red cell aplasia. \u2022 Renal complications to interferon alfa include renal thrombotic microangiopathy, acute nephrotic syndrome, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, renal insuffi ciency due to interstitial nephritis, tubular necrosis, and IgA nephropathy. \u2022 The list of cutaneous reactions to interferon alfa is extensive and includes injection site reactions (erythema, necrosis, and vasculitis), pruritus, xerosis, urticaria, hyperpigmentation, psoriasis, alopecia, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, sarcoid nodules, eosinophilic fasciitis, livedo reticularis, vitiligo, and fi xed drug eruption. Interferon alfa is well known for exacerbating pre-existing psoriasis but cases of new onset psoriasis occur with both interferon alfa-2a and interferon alfa-2b. \u2022 A fl u-like illness is the most commonly occurring adverse event following administration of interferon beta and injection site reactions are also common. \u2022 Neutralizing antibodies are found in about a quarter of patients treated with subcutaneously administered interferon beta-1b and the consensus is that they neutralize or reduce the cytokine's activity. Other immunologic effects observed to both beta interferons are some cases of a lupus-like syndrome and cutaneous lymphocytic vasculitis. \u2022 Unlike interferon alfa, results from studies do not support an association of interferon beta with depression but the FDA mention depression, suicide, and psychotic disorders in their warnings and precautions for the cytokine. \u2022 Interferon beta can induce thyroid disorders notably hyperthyroidism and a severe case of hypothyroidism resembling Hashimoto's encephalopathy has been reported. \u2022 Skin reactions include urticaria to interferon beta-1a and an acneiform eruption to interferon beta-1b. \u2022 In 2014, the FDA granted approval for Plegridy \u00ae , a pegylated preparation of interferon beta-1a. Common adverse reactions to Plegridy \u00ae are similar to the nonpegylated form of the cytokine, viz., injection site reactions, an infl uenza-like illness, asthenia, arthralgia, and pruritus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "255"}, {"text": "\u2022 Cardiovascular toxicity to interferon gamma, particularly at higher doses, include hypotension, arrhythmias, coronary vasospasm and ventricular tachycardia, and renal toxicity, namely acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, and tubular necrosis. \u2022 The occurrence of fatal acute respiratory failure in some patients treated with interferon gamma-1b for advanced idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis prompted further investigation of the condition. No clear evidence for the involvement of interferon gamma-1b was found. \u2022 Described as \"the master regulators of granulocyte and macrophage populations,\" the colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are used to treat chemotherapyinduced neutropenia, mobilize stem cells for transplantation, and enhance the immune response to cancer. Currently, approved members of the CSF family are fi lgrastim and pegfi lgrastim, both G-CSFs, sargramostim, a GM-CSF, and tbofi lgrastim, a short acting biosimilar G-CSF. \u2022 CSF-induced adverse events are usually mild and transient including headache, bone pain, myalgia, fever, fl ushing, and rash. More severe, and rare, events are adult respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary toxicities, particularly pulmonary edema and interstitial pneumonitis, fl uid retention, aortitis, capillary leak syndrome, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and spleen rupture. G-CSF may be a risk for the progression of myelodysplastic syndrome. Other potentially lifethreatening responses to CSFs, the subject of warnings, are anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions and severe adverse events such as acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive episodes, multiorgan failure, and death seen in patients with sickle cell disease. \u2022 There is a long list of adverse skin reactions provoked by CSFs. The most commonly occurring cutaneous reaction is Sweet's syndrome seen after therapy with sargramostim and fi lgrastim. Other adverse cutaneous events include psoriasis fl are, pyogenic granulomas, pruritic erythematous maculopapular eruptions, palmoplantar pustulosis, erythema multiforme, and neutrophilic dermatoses. \u2022 Recombinant human IL-11, or oprelvekin, is used to prevent chemotherapyinduced thrombocytopenia and reduce the need for platelet transfusions in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies. Fluid retention and an increase in plasma volume underlie many of the adverse events, for example, edema, dyspnea, pleural effusions, arrhythmia, dilutional anemia, and renal failure, and indicate that oprelvekin should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure. \u2022 Becaplermin is a recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a homodimer made up of two disulfi de-bonded B chains and hence written as rhPDGF-BB. \u2022 rhPDGF-BB promotes the growth of granulation tissue and wound healing via interaction with receptors on fi broblasts and endothelial cells. Becaplermin has therefore found use in gel form as a topical application for patients with diffi cult to heal diabetic neuropathic ulcers. \u2022 The FDA has issued a boxed warning for becaplermin gel to the effect that becaplermin should be used with caution in patients with known malignancy and only used when the benefi ts can be expected to outweigh the risks. \u2022 Palifermin, a recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor produced by mesenchymal cells and fi broblasts, stimulates differentiation, proliferation, and migration of epithelial cells via interaction with its complementary receptors on epithelial cells widely distributed in numerous tissues. Palifermin is an important agent in oncological supportive care, aiding the management of mucositis in cancer patients by protecting the mucosal epithelium and aiding its regeneration after chemotherapy-and radiation-induced injury. \u2022 Adverse events following palifermin administration include rash, pruritus, erythema, paresthesia, edema, taste alteration, rhinitis, arthralgia, thickening of the tongue, and numbness. Numerous cutaneous reactions include acral erythema, a papulopustular eruption on the head and trunk, hyperpigmented papillomatous plaques in the axillae and inguinal areas, and a case of lichenoid papules. Being a growth factor, palifermin carries a warning of potential stimulation of tumor growth. \u2022 Aldesleukin, a recombinant human IL-2, differs from the natural cytokine by absence of glycan residues and at position 125 and the end terminal amino acid. X-ray and NMR studies have shown that the IL-2 fold is similar to that seen in the myelopoietic-stimulatory factors G-CSF and GM-CSF. \u2022 Cardiovascular adverse events are the main dose-limiting toxicities of aldesleukin with cases of hypotension, tachycardia, peripheral edema, pleural effusions, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, heart block, arrhythmias, cardiac eosinophilic infi ltration, and coronary ischemic changes. Vascular leak syndrome causes hypovolemia, fl uid accumulation in the extravascular spaces, oliguria, and pulmonary side effects. Hematologic adverse effects, particularly anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia occur but are rarely severe or dose limiting. \u2022 Endocrine effects of aldesleukin usually manifest as hypothyroidism or, far less commonly, hyperthyroidism. Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported and IL-2-induced infectious toxicities, usually due to Staphylococcus , may occur at venous catheter sites. Neurological effects, especially to high doses during IL-2 therapy, include anxiety, depression, altered sleep patterns, somnolence, emotional fragility, vivid dreams, and confusion. \u2022 The list of aldesleukin-induced cutaneous reactions is extensive, ranging from mild erythema, pruritus, injection site reactions and vitiligo, to urticaria, angioedema, reactivation of eczema, exacerbation of psoriasis, generalized erythema followed by desquamation, vasculitis, and severe manifestations like pemphigus, IgA bullous dermatosis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. \u2022 Anakinra is a recombinant specifi c receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) for IL-1 differing from the natural receptor by the addition of a single methionine at the amino terminal end. Anakinra acts as a biological response modifi er in the treatment of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and the spectrum of autoinfl ammatory syndromes collectively known as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). \u2022 The most common adverse events to anakinra are injection site reactions which occur in up to 73 % of patients and infection episodes. Other reported side effects include progression of rheumatoid arthritis, exacerbation of Crohn's disease, anaphylaxis, systemic infl ammatory response syndrome, ARDS, an interstitial granulomatous reaction, and some severe skin reactions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "256"}, {"text": "\u2022 The main adverse effects of epoetin (rhEPO) in anemic patients with end-stage renal disease are myalgias, iron defi ciency, elevated blood pressure, and seizures. Hypertension is a common side effect with approximately one-third of dialysis patients affected and hypertension and increased viscosity due to rhEPO may lead to encephalopathy, convulsions, cerebral edema, and seizures. Controlled studies on cancer patients revealed a higher risk of thromboembolic events with rhEPO therapy than controls. \u2022 Cerebral ischemia with increased metabolic rate and blood viscosity is a potentially severe side effect of EPO. EPO receptors have been demonstrated in tumor tissue and the cytokine may assist with tumor angiogenesis, suggesting the possibility of EPO initiating tumor growth or aiding tumor progression. \u2022 Both epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa carry a boxed warning related to a possible increased risk of death, cardiac, and thromboembolic events and tumor progression or recurrence. \u2022 In cases of transfusion-dependent pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) with neutralizing serum antibodies to EPO, patients should not be switched to another epoetin such as darbepoetin alfa since a systemic anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid response mediated by anti-EPO antibodies cross-reactive antibodies may result. \u2022 An investigation of the effect of darbepoetin alfa in anemic patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure revealed three main adverse events: neurological signs and symptoms, upper respiratory tract infections, and joint-related signs and symptoms. \u2022 Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are growth factors inducing the formation of bone and cartilage and important signaling proteins in some disease states such as adenocarcinoma and the progression of colon cancer. BMP-2 and BMP-7 promote the differentiation of osteoblasts and, on the basis of this action, recombinant forms of both cytokines (rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7) are approved by the FDA for specifi c uses in orthopedic, oral, and maxillofacial surgery and implant dentistry although up to 85 % of their usage is said to be off-label. \u2022 Recent results with rhBMP-2 indicate a much higher incidence of side effects and complications than originally reported. Identifi cation of previously unpublished adverse effects, study inconsistencies, and a comparative review of FDA material has revealed an adverse events frequency associated with rhBMP-2 in spine fusion of 10-50 %. Reported adverse events were swelling, fl uid collection, osteolysis, pain/radiculopathy, heterotropic bone, pseudarthrosis, surgical site infections and other wound complications, thromboembolic events, respiratory distress, and cancer. \u2022 In an examination of the prevalence and complications of BMP use in spinal fusion procedures, the following complications were identifi ed: vertebral osteolysis, graft migration, graft subsidence, formation of neutralizing antibodies to BMP-2, ectopic/heterotopic bone formation, and hematoma. \u2022 Concern for the carcinogenic potential of rhBMP-2 was reinforced by a 2010 FDA Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Devices Advisory Panel report on the Amplify \u2122 rhBMP-2 matrix of increased cancer rates among BMP-2-treated patients. At \u226460 months cancer incidences were patients 5 % and controls 2.1 %.Other studies have reported tumor-enhancing, tumor-suppressing, or no dependence effects. \u2022 rhBMP-7, also known as osteogenic protein 1 (OP-1), is a multifunctional growth factor. Apart from an FDA Public Health Notifi cation of life-threatening complications associated with rhBMP (including rhBMP-7, in cervical spine fusion), and the reminder that rhBMPs are contraindicated in skeletally immature or pregnant patients and those with hypersensitivity to the protein, studies on, and reports of, adverse events to BMP-7 are not yet extensive. \u2022 In a clinical trial designed to evaluate rhBMP-7 in the treatment of tibial reunions, adverse events were mild or moderate and nonserious, for example, fever, nausea, vomiting, leg edema and discomfort, and hematoma at the operative site. Low levels of anti-BMP-7 antibodies were detected in 10 % of the treated patients, but all titers were low with no related adverse events. \u2022 Leptin, a 167 amino acid protein of MW 16 kDa produced primarily by adipocytes, helps to control energy homeostasis and body weight by adjusting hunger and energy expenditure to regulate fat stores. It also regulates some neuroendocrine functions and other physiological processes. Metreleptin, a recombinant analog of leptin is used as replacement therapy to treat leptin defi ciency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. It is not to be used in patients with general obesity, for HIV-related lipodystrophy or in patients with metabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus) without concurrent generalized lipodystrophy. \u2022 Neutralizing antibodies may develop to metreleptin. Because of this, the possibility of worsening of renal disease, and the occurrence of T-cell lymphoma in patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy, the protein is only available under the Myalept Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Program. \u2022 Ancestim is a recombinant human stem cell factor (SCF) important for hematopoiesis, spermatogenesis, and melanogenesis. It acts in synergy with some other hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF, GM-CSF, erythropoietins, and IL-2 to stimulate multiple hematopoietic lineages. \u2022 Together with fi lgrastim, ancestim should only be administered to patients who are at risk of inadequate peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization. Ancestim is used with fi lgrastim to effect a sustained mobilization of PBPCs and achieve a reduction in the number of apheresis required. Care should be exercised in the simultaneous use of the cytokine combination in patients given chemo/radiotherapy; administration should be avoided 24 h before and after the cytotoxic therapy. \u2022 Patients with a history of anaphylaxis, asthma, recurrent urticaria, angioedema, and mast cell diseases such as systemic mastocytosis who are to be given ancestim may be at particular risk and should be premedicated with H1 and H2 antihistamines and a bronchodilator. \u2022 The range of biological events set in motion even by individual cytokines, warns of the possibility of unwanted side effects and the resultant caution is refl ected by the relatively small number of cytokines currently approved by regulatory agencies. Sixteen of the 23 listed FDA-approved cytokine preparations carry warnings with ten of these being black box warnings. \u2022 The diverse nature of interferon side effects, including neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, ischemic, and infection adverse events, together with their therapeutic Summary benefi ts, provides a good illustration of the two-edged nature of cytokine pleiotropism. Despite this, cytokine adverse events profi les do not generally negate benefi ts and sometimes observed toxicities may even correspond with improved outcomes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "258"}]}
