As a result, travel restrictions dampen economic activity by reducing demand in tourism-dependent industries such as hotels, restaurants and aviation (Rashid et al., 2015[5] ).

Evidence that is available is largely based on modelling studies, which suggest quarantine decreases the peak case load, the attack rate and would also delay the peak. Household quarantine is potentially the most effective measure to reduce attack rates in the community, but only if compliance is high (Rashid et al., 2015[5] ). Voluntary or self-isolation of infected people is moderately effective. For instance, voluntary quarantine of households with an infected individual may delay the peak of influenza by two to 26 days, and reduce the peak daily attack rate from 1.9% to 1.5%, or even down to 0.1%, depending on the associated interventions (e.g. such as treating infected people and applying prophylaxis to their households the day after the symptoms start, school closure) (Ferguson et al., 2006[14] ). Modelling work simulating the isolation of cases and contacts in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic concluded that about 70% of cases had to be traced to successfully contain the outbreak, assuming a reproduction number of 2.5 (Hellewell et al., 2020[29] ). Implementation of contact tracing and quarantine measures bears economic costs, and is associated with psychological, legal, and ethical issues. First, contact tracing requires substantial resources to sustain after the early phase of the epidemic since the number of infected people and contacts grow exponentially. While there is no obvious rationale for a routine use of contact tracing in the general population, it may be adapted in some circumstances (e.g. if there was an infected person on an aircraft) (Fong et al., 2020 [31] ). In addition, isolation is likely to cause distress and mental health problems, requiring additional services such as creating support lines and advice, helping people create plans, encouraging messages and calls and maintaining some routine (Lunn et al., 2020 [32] ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 381, "end": 404, "text": "(Rashid et al., 2015[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 863, "end": 889, "text": "(Ferguson et al., 2006[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1146, "text": "(Hellewell et al., 2020[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1680, "end": 1684, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1952, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Contact tracing and quarantine"}, {"text": "During an epidemic, policymakers can use campaigns to communicate with the public.

On the other hand, it is important to strike a balance between preventing panic and encouraging action.

Other restrictions include bans on (or advice to restrict) non-essential travel, voluntary or legally mandated isolation upon arrival into a new country as well as border closures(Mateus et al., 2014[21]; Australian Government, 2020[22]; Foreign & Commonwealth Office, 2020[23]) Evidence to assess the effectiveness of travel restrictions are limited given they are frequently implemented alongside other countermeasures thereby making it difficult to ascertain causal effects(Mateus et al., 2014[21]). Consequently, the impact of national and international travel restrictions are typically measured using mathematical models. A systematic review byMateus et al. (2014[21]) generalised findings from the literature related to influenza and concluded travel restrictions delay but do not prevent pandemics (e.g. delays up to 3-4 weeks when 90% of air travel is restricted in affected countries, or by two months if more restrictive measures are introduced). This finding aligns with experiences from other epidemic diseases. For example, a 60% reduction in airline passenger traffic from the Ebola affected region of West Africa was estimated to have delayed the spread of the disease to other continents by between 2-30 days(Poletto et al., 2014[24]). Regarding internal travel, a 2006 study found travel restrictions between cities in the United States during the 2001-02 influenza season delayed peak mortality by 16 days(Brownstein, Wolfe and Mandl, 2006[25]). The impact of internal travel restrictions have also been estimated for the COVID-19 outbreak, for example,Kucharski et al. (2020[26]) estimated that the introduction of travel control measures in Wuhan, China, reduced the median daily reproduction number from 2.35 to 1.05.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "The effectiveness of this policy depends on numerous factors.
