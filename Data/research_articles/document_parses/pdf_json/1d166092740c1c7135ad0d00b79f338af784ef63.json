A thoughtful and concerted effort is necessary to mitigate these effects. The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic will leave a permanent mark on all aspects of society, including politics, culture, economics, health policy, and medicine. Hospitals are at the frontline of this crisis and have shifted their resources to handle the coronavirus pandemic on an unprecedented scale. No department has been left untouched from the effects of COVID-19, surgery included. By mid-March, institutions in hotspot areas began postponing or canceling elective cases to preserve resources and reduce risk of transmission. 1 Currently, hospitals are only performing the most urgent cases. However, elective surgery is not optional surgery; it may be deemed non-urgent at this time but does not mean unnecessary. In 2014, more than 21 million surgeries were performed in the United States, 2 and estimates suggest 91% of U.S surgeries are elective. 3 At the conclusion of the crisis, there will be at least a three-month backlog of surgery. Rough calculations suggest that these three months translate into nearly 5 million surgical cases. The impending surgery backlog is a serious problem that hospital administrators and surgeons will inevitably need to address.",

For certain cancers, advancement to later stages can occur in as little as 4-8 weeks, well within projected delays of elective surgical procedures. More advanced disease at the time of surgery may result in increasingly morbid operations which are associated with higher costs. Delays in surgery have been shown to result in higher rates of surgical site infections, leading to increased costs ranging from $7,000-$17,000 for coronary artery bypass graft and colon and lung resections. 5 Some diseases are being managed non-operatively which may increase expenditures. The medical consequences of surgical delays will likely manifest in increased costs to the healthcare system via treatment of more advanced disease, often requiring more intense and more costly treatment. For example, disease progression in breast, colorectal, and lung cancer is associated with an annual increase of $50,000 per case. 6 Even the deferral of procedures traditionally considered low-acuity, such as cataract surgery, joint replacements, or bariatric cases will have material implications via reduced activity, mobility, and quality of life for patients.

Many diagnostic procedures, including colonoscopies, mammograms, and biopsies, are on hold during the pandemic. As a result, there may be a decline in diagnoses of cancer and cardiovascular disease during this period, followed by a surge in new cases upon resumption of diagnostic procedures. This will compound the surgical backlog that most institutions will already be facing in the latter half of the year. Each specialty and surgical division should take advantage of the current interruption in the regular schedule to consider the accrual of cases and start determining a prioritization order for these patients. For instance, tumor boards should use this opportunity to begin examining patients on a case-bycase basis and determine some order of priority once we can proceed with surgical care. It is imperative surgical departments start this process now, especially as we may face future halts and starts in surgical schedules.

Although there may be a surge of surgical cases in the latter half of the year, this current period is the final quarter of training for many surgical residents and fellows. Consequently, the American Board of Surgery has decided to reduce case number requirements so that trainees may achieve board eligibility at the conclusion of the academic year. The pandemic has also disrupted research activity across the country.

Medical centers will have to account for the loss of revenue from delaying or canceling elective surgery. Hospitals will also likely face changes in insurer and payer mix, with greater numbers of newly uninsured and publicly insured patients, which will in turn affect already strained hospital financial accounts. As a result of the crisis, three in ten Americans have lost their jobs, been laid off, or had their hours reduced without pay. 8 Many will also lose their health insurance, a known determinant of access to surgical care and associated with worse surgical outcomes. 9 Certain socioeconomic groups are already disadvantaged with regards to receipt of timely surgical treatment. 10 COVID will undoubtedly exacerbate the challenges these vulnerable groups face.
