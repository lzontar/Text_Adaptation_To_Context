Four out of the five biopsy specimens on extended culture incubation at 33\u00b0C yielded a coronavirus virus (EBNV) which was cytopathogenic for human fibroblast and Vero cells. In cells inoculated with EBNV, cytoplasmic immunofluorescence was found using antisera for human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E as well as the porcine transmissible gastroenteric virus and avian (chicken) bronchitis virus.

Using hyperimmune serum raised with EBNV, positive cytoplasmic immunofluorescence was seen with cells infected with OC43, 229E, TGV and significantly with the kidney tissue of the biopsy specimens from the EBN patients. A screen for neutralizing antibody using the EBN virus revealed that 87.2% of EBN patients on dialysis were positive, also 74% of people from an endemic area were also positive, while only 13.5% from outside were positive.

The main symptoms of the disease are progressive loss of kidney function without raised blood pressure leading to end-stage kidney failure. In up to 50% of EBN patients, tumors of the urinary tract appear. There are no reliable specific tests and the diagnosis of EBN is based on clinical and epidemiological grounds.
