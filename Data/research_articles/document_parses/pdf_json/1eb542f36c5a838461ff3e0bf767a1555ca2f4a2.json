Associated with this growth has been a steady increase in radiologists' salaries, stiff competition for residency training positions and a chronic shortage of radiologists to meet the demands of growth.",

In its first-quarter financial results, Mednax procedure volume fell 50%-60%, forcing the company to implement measures to conserve cash, including salary reductions and furloughs for nonclinical employees. It should be noted that a variety of prior financial challenges have resulted in some academic medical centers, with and without associated physicians, seeking shelter in the for-profit sector.

Overall, respondents were pleased with their internal teleradiology experience, with a majority reporting decreased stress levels, improved or no change in turnaround time, no change in rapport with other physicians, and decreased interruptions. Telecommuting decanted crowded reading rooms and provided a secondary benefit to radiologists with young or school age children since the children were no longer in school or able to access planned daycare.

New remote approaches to achieve this type of networking are wanting. Nevertheless, some radiologists will prefer the virtual meeting format. It does not require the time or cost for travel. Virtual formats also allow for a wider audience, help faculty presentations be more easily and broadly disseminated, and may provide an opportunity for radiologists with young children (particularly women) to participate more fully in organized radiology through a virtual format Radiology professional organizations rely on the work of member volunteers to carry out their missions and most rely on dues to fund their activities. At least during the time of restricted travel, it will be more difficult, and perhaps less attractive for volunteers to participate, potentially weakening the ability of these vital organizations to continue functioning at the highest levels. Likewise, reduced financial circumstances are likely to cause some radiologists to cut back on the number of organizations they support with their dues. Optimistically, when there is a return to more normal conditions both of these issues will resolve.",
