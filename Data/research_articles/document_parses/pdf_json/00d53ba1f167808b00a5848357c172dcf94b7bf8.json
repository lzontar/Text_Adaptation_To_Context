            "text": "The global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has placed an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems as the virus spread from the initial 27 reported cases in the city of Wuhan, China to a global pandemic in under three months 1 . Resources essential to monitoring virus transmission have been challenged with a demand for expanded surveillance. The CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time Diagnostic Panel uses a real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) consisting of two TaqMan probe and primer sets specific for the 2019-nCoV N gene, which codes for the nucleocapsid structural protein that encapsulates viral RNA, for the qualitative detection of 2019-nCoV viral RNA in respiratory samples. To isolate RNA from respiratory samples, the CDC lists RNA extraction kits from three manufacturers. In anticipation of a limited supply chain of RNA extraction kits and the need for test scalability, we sought to identify alternative RNA extraction methods. Here we show that direct lysis of respiratory samples can be used in place of RNA extraction kits to run the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time Diagnostic assay with the additional benefits of higher throughput, lower cost, faster turnaround and possibly higher senitivity and improved saftey.",

Viral particles in the samples remain infectious until lysed during RNA extraction. The RNA is then prepared by using a column based RNA extraction kit. We showed previously that RNA can be extracted by one-step lysis in QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (QE buffer) and directly used in RT-qPCR 3 . The QE buffer contains detergents and proteinase K, both of which could inactivate viral particles. Previous work on hepatitis C and ebola virus has shown that detergent alone is sufficient to reduce infectious titer in the absence of serum (e.g. fetal bovine serum) and is even more effective in combination with proteinase K which degrades core viral proteins accessible through lipid viral envelop dissolution by detergent 4, 5 .",

Samples were then heated at 65\u00b0C for 15 min followed by 98\u00b0C for 2 min to inactivate proteinase K and then directly used for the test using a single probe and primer set (N1) as well as the set for RNaseP.",

Although an equal volume of lysis extract was used to generate the positive control counterpart of OP experimental samples, RNaseP reference signals were 2 cycles greater for positive controls, suggesting that the swab containing portion retained more cells. But it's important to point out that the raw Ct values do not change the interpretation of results for what is intended to be a qualitative yes/no assay -that the positive and extraction controls performed within the range (<40) to determine the presence or absence of 2019-nCoV N gene in experimental samples 6 .",

Samples were heat extracted after 24 hours and used for the RT-qPCR test with probe sets N1 and N2. The sample without positive control added was processed for extraction immediately after the collection. All positive control samples had a Ct value between 33-34 for N1 and N2 across conditions. The Ct values for reference RNaseP were within the range of 26-29 when the collection swab was present during heat extraction and a Ct range of 29-31 when the swab was not present. This is consistent with epithelial cells being caught in the polyester fibers during collection. The spiked plasmid DNA does not seem to be retained on the swab.

Our indicators for adequate assay performance are consistent with CDC assay interpretation guidelines, the detection of a Ct level of <40 for 2019-nCoV positive control counterparts and for RNaseP reference signal for positive controls and experimental samples 4 . The direct lysis takes less than 20 min to process samples ready for RT-qPCR and can be easily scaled up to a 96-well format and obtain higher throughput. The cost of the lysis buffer is much lower than that of a column purification kit.

It indicates that there is significant loss of material by column purification and the benefit of concentrating the samples is evened out. Additionally, our method starts with only 200 ul of lysis buffer, and 2 ul of direct lysis is 1/100 of the total sample. If we use a smaller swab, which is available, the volume can be lowered further. With the standard method, the sample transport buffer is 3 mL and only 120 ul to 140 ul, depending on the extraction kit, is taken for purification, essentially a 1:15 dilution that can translate into up to a difference of 4 Ct's.",

The presence of the collection swab during heat extraction is also shown (+/-swab). The positive control is plasmid DNA template spiked at 100 copies/ul into specimen sample. A value of NS indicates no signal was detected.",
