For individuals who have not been N95 fit-tested, have facial hair, or fail N95 fit-testing, powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) should be used if possible [28] . Surgical face masks protect against COVID-19 droplet transmission but do not protect against aerosolized small particles. N95 masks are defined by The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) respirator approval criteria as a filter class that removes at least 95% of the \"mostpenetrating\" sized airborne particle during a NIOSH standardized test procedure [29] . Although N95 masks, like other transmission barriers, should ideally be disposed of and changed between patients, during pandemics and times of equipment shortage when contact transmission is not a concern (e.g. fomites), guidance from federal organizations recommend that a respirator classified as disposable can be reused by the same worker as long as it remains functional, which is termed 'limited reuse' [30] [31] [32] . If masks are reused, the greatest risk stems from survival of the pathogen on the respiratory surface, which can be transmitted by hand contact [33] . Steps to reduce this risk include wearing cleanable face shields over the N95 mask or masking patients to reduce the chance of contamination, limiting the number of uses (5 uses in the absence of specific manufacturer recommendations), visual inspection for body fluids or damage, fit-testing to ensure continued effectiveness, washing hands and using gloves before doffing and donning equipment, and proper storage between uses [34].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 487, "end": 491, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 874, "end": 878, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1291, "end": 1295, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1300, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1301, "end": 1305, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1456, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SPECIFIC RISK MITIGATION"}, {"text": "Although procedures by necessity require hands-on exposure and are often considered to pose high infection risk, risk is governed by multiple factors including exposure time, body regions exposed, pre-visit risk mitigation, venue, etc. and for some of these the risk be lower for simple procedures compared to new evaluations. Unlike new patient encounters, they involve patients who are already known to physicians and do not typically require a complete physical exam. For the most common procedures performed, patients are positioned face down, and the contact area is limited and sterilely prepped. Similar to open surgical procedures, providers may request that patients shower before receiving injections in high-risk situations. If available, masks can be provided to patients to reduce the risk of droplet spread. When performing procedures with the potential for aerosolization such as intransal sphenopalatine ganglion blocks and intra-oral injections, N95 masks should be used as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ASA [35] . Procedures should be performed with the minimal number of personnel, ideally by a physician with extensive experience to minimize risk exposure. In academic or group practices that have significantly diminished patient loads whereby procedure time is limited to a few hours per day or a couple of sessions or days per Official Journal of the American Academy of Pain Medicine week, consideration should be given to designating one person to perform all procedures during the allotted time slot to minimize practitioner exposure.

It is important to recognize that these recommendations are meant to serve as guidelines, not standards, which come from an undisputed, unquestioned authority, and are therefore less subject to interpretation and modification. The risk-benefit calculation of performing in-person visits and procedures must take into account not only individual factors (e.g. psychological health, the likelihood of a patient to seek emergency services), and the probability of benefit, but also context, logistical concerns, relevant regulations and conditions in the area, and the availability of resources, all of which are constantly evolving. For patients in whom triage determines warrants an in-person visit, general and pain-specific risk mitigation strategies should be adhered to. o Provides updates on COVID-19 for regional anesthesia and pain medicine specialists. \uf0a7 https://www.asra.com/page/2900/updates-on-covid-19-for-regionalanesthesia-and-pain-medicine-specialists -Neurolytic procedures for refractory cancerassociated pain -Epidural steroid injections for acute disc herniation or acute pain exacerbation -Vertebroplasty of kyphoplasty for refractory pain from acute vertebral compression fracture 4 -Replacement of neurostimulation devices in which there is a high likelihood that abrupt cessation of therapy will lead to decompensation. -Sympathetic blocks for early complex regional pain syndrome after conservative treatment failure -Treatments for acute or acute exacerbations of refractory spinal pain where there is a high likelihood of physical or psychological disability (radiofrequency ablation in a person with disabling recurrence after previous relief, sacroiliac joint injection for acute, disabling pain) -Debilitating nerve entrapment syndromes with neurological deficits -Acute headaches likely to respond to blocks (e.g. occipital neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia) 5 Consider and discuss risks and benefits with patient and facility.

Given the rapidly evolving situation and the real-time dispensation of medical information via non-traditional venues, authors were given wide latitude in preparing their sections, with no restrictions on sources, search engines, types of articles or language. A second call was held on 26 March 2020, at which time it was decided to seek endorsement from stakeholder societies, with a one-week suspense date. The document was sent to the Boards of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine (ASRA), American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM), Spine Intervention Society (SIS), North American Official Journal of the American Academy of Pain Medicine Neuromodulation Society (NANS) and the World Institute of Pain (WIP), all of whom endorsed the document, with minor revisions. The final document was also supported by the ASA and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPMR). The article was submitted for publication to 'Pain Medicine' on 29 March 2020 and accepted on 1 April 2020.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "steroid injections as clinical conditions indicate during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lowest dose possible should be used, and patients should be informed of the possibility of immunosuppression and potential risk for infection. In patients who are already immunosuppressed and at high-risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and complications, epidural nonsteroid injections may be considered for radicular pain, though the possibility of treatment failure requiring a subsequent procedure must be weighed against the theoretical risk for infection. NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS Non-peer-reviewed case reports of several young patients infected with SARS CoV-2 deteriorating after taking ibuprofen generated concerns from healthcare providers and patients about the safety of NSAIDs during the COVID-19 pandemic [98]. On March 18, 2020, the World Health Organization advised patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms to avoid the use of ibuprofen, which was a position reversed by the organization the following day. The theory postulated for this was that NSAIDs could increase levels of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which could increase susceptibility to infection or aggravate symptoms. Currently, Official Journal of the American Academy of Pain Medicine neither the FDA or the European Medicines Agency are aware of any evidence linking the use of ibuprofen or other NSAIDs to worsening COVID-19 symptoms", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Figure legend", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Interventional pain management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
