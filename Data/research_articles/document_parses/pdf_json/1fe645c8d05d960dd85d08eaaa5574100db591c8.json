Applying recombinantly expressed spike proteins of infectious bronchitis virus onto formalin-fi xed tissues allows us to profi le the binding characteristics of these viral attachment proteins to tissues of various avian species. In particular, sialic acid-mediated tissue binding of spike proteins can be analyzed by pretreating tissues with various neuraminidases or by blocking the binding of the viral proteins with specifi c lectins. Our assay is particularly convenient to elucidate critical virus-host interactions for viruses for which infection models are limited.",

Many IBV serotypes have been isolated so far and some serotypes induce pathological changes in organs other than the respiratory tissues [ 1 ] . This variable tissue tropism is likely due to tissue-specifi c factors resulting in differences in binding or entry of the virus. Although a specifi c protein receptor for IBV is yet to be revealed it has been shown by removing sialic acids from the susceptible cell surface, that \u03b12, 3-linked sialic acids are a determinant of cell attachment and entry of IBV [ 2 , 3 ] . Further elucidation of hostvirus interactions is, however, hampered due to limitations in in vitro infection model systems for pathogenic IBV strains.",

By swapping the gene encoding for spike protein between different IBV serotypes it has been shown that the spike determines the tissue tropism [ 4 ] .

Analyzing the binding of S1 to tissues with our protein histochemistry protocol enables us not only to profi le the attachment of avian coronavirus S1 proteins to various avian tissues but also to elucidate glycan binding specifi cities of IBV S1 [ 8 ] as well as determinants within S1 for tissue attachment [ 9 ] .
