For the 2014 season, a hospital in the Netherlands reported an increase of EV-D68; 16 patients were infected (12) . Such an increase in EV-D68 infections was already seen in 2010 at the same hospital along with an increased number of cases throughout the country (13) . This finding increased the possibility that an increase in EV-D68 infections in primary care will also extend to increased numbers of infections in patients in secondary care.

Severe disease was observed in 3 children who had obstructive bronchitis and pneumonia, and 1 child required hospital care. Similarly, mild respiratory disease was predominantly observed for patients in the Netherlands (14) . However, more severe cases were detected among hospitalized children who had life-threatening respiratory illness, as described in the United States (6, 12, 14) . More than half of patients with severe respiratory illness in Germany and the Netherlands had concurrent conditions (12, 14) , which seem to be a major factor for development of severe disease after EV-D68 infection (6) .",

AY426531); and B) partial VP1 region (339 nt) corresponding to nt 2521-2859 in the Fermon strain. Trees were constructed by using maximumlikelihood estimation (Tamura 3-parameter with 5 gamma distributed rates among sites) with 1,000 replicates through MEGA 5.2 (http://www.megasoftware.net/). The Fermon strain was used as an outgroup. Reference sequences were selected from the United States, countries in Europe, and other regions, mainly during 2005-2014. Selected reference sequences are not identical in both trees because complementary VP1 and VP4/VP2 sequence data are not available for all reference viruses. Major groups 1, 2, and 3 are shown as described by Meijer et al.(13,14). Only bootstrap values >65% are shown at branch nodes. EV-D68 strains from Germany are indicated in bold. Scale bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per site. Some parts of the trees are collapsed.
