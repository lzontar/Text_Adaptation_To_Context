The exact role that intestinal transplantation will ultimately play in intestinal failure management is not yet clear and will ultimately be determined by its effectiveness compared with other available therapeutic options. Data from both the International Intestinal Transplant Registry [1\u2022\u2022] and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry [2\u2022\u2022] indicate that the number of intestinal transplants performed per year has increased each year since 1990, with the exception of 1994. The suboptimal results achieved thus far, the inconsistent insurance coverage policies, and the lack of clear guidelines regarding the role of transplantation in the management of patients with intestinal failure, have contributed to uncertainty among managing physicians about when to refer patients for evaluation for this procedure. This article summarizes the key issues for practitioners to consider in determining when to refer such patients for intestinal transplantation.",

The Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA) based this decision on their review of three independent evaluations, including 1) data submitted by an individual requestor; 2) a 1999 technology assessment performed by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Technology Evaluation Center; and 3) a separate technology assessment performed by the Center for Practice and Technology Assessment at the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ). Based on this information, Medicare has determined that intestinal transplantation is indicated only if TPN therapy has failed. They have defined \"TPN failure\" as the development of at least one of the following: liver failure, major vein thrombosis, frequent line-related sepsis, or recurrent dehydration (Table 1) .",

            "text": "Currently, TPN is the accepted therapy for intestinal failure. TPN is life-sustaining for many individuals, but its longterm use can be associated with serious complications in some patients. Reports of TPN-related complications vary Significantly reduced morbidity and mortality is needed before intestinal transplantation will be applicable in most patients with intestinal failure who are on long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN). However, transplantation does play a role if TPN fails, with failure defined by Medicare as liver failure, frequent line sepsis, major central vein thrombosis, or recurrent dehydration. Of these complications, the relationship between liver failure and subsequent death in high-risk subgroups of long-term TPN patients has been shown clearly. Patients with less than 100 cm of postduodenal small bowel, an end-jejunostomy, no ileocecal valve or cecum, or persistently elevated liver function levels are at high risk for end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Early referral to experienced centers is suggested in these circumstances. High-risk patients may also take part in clinical trials of promising therapies to increase intestinal adaptation and prevent liver failure. Living donors should be considered for transplant candidates to minimize waiting time and optimize HLA matching. ESLD patients need a liver-intestine transplant. Because their waiting-list mortality is very high, their status on the liver waiting list should be elevated if possible. High incidence of early death from sepsis is reported after intestinal transplant, even at experienced centers. Aggressive measures should be taken if uncontrolled sepsis occurs, including discontinuing immunosuppression and removing the graft. Further research is needed in intestinal immunology and in development of strategies to decrease the need for aggressive immunosuppression in these transplant recipents. The ultimate role of intestinal transplantation will be determined by its capacity to show superiority, both in effectiveness and safety, to long-term TPN.",

These registry data were based on information submitted voluntarily by 223 North American centers and included outcome profiles on 5481 TPN patients with 8-year follow-up. Although these data represent a larger population of North American TPN patients than other published reports, national estimates based on Medicare data suggest that the registry sampled only 5% of US home-TPN patients. The Oley registry did not stratify outcomes based on duration of HPN therapy, although more than 50% of the patients in these diagnostic categories were weaned from TPN within 1 year. Furthermore, the registry data were largely based on information provided by physician-directed programs (78%) that followed several patients (64% from programs with more than six patients). Therefore, these data may not accurately reflect the overall North American experience if most HPN patients are managed by physicians who follow only one or two HPN patients.",

These abnormalities can present in a broad spectrum of pathologic entities including steatosis, cholestasis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis [4,5\u2022\u2022] . Liver complications appear to be especially prevalent in pediatric patients on long-term TPN [6] . In the last official report from the Oley Foundation registry in 1994, there were no specific data on liver complications [3] . A recent study from Harvard found that 15% of patients receiving TPN for more than 1 year developed end-stage liver disease (ESLD), which was associated with 100% mortality within 2 years of onset [7] . Another recent report, from France [5\u2022\u2022] , suggests that more than 50% of adult patients on TPN for more than 5 years will develop complicated liver disease (ie, grade 2 or 3 fibrosis, or one of the following: bilirubin greater than 3.5 mg/dL for more than 1 month, ascites, portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, or liver failure with Factor V less than 50%). Because, in France, all HPN patients are treated and monitored by a small number of authorized regional HPN centers, these results may be more representative of an entire population of HPN patients than are data from center-specific studies.",

The shorter the remaining small intestine, the more likely liver complications will develop [5\u2022\u2022] . A terminal jejunostomy is associated with a higher incidence of TPN dependence and greater mortality than if intestinal continuity is maintained with a jejunal-colic anastomosis.

The Oley registry does not provide data for all central vein occlusions, but they indicate that the superior vena caval (SVC) thrombosis resulted in less than 0.3 hospital admissions/patient-year. Moukarzel et al. [14] found that, in long-term pediatric TPN patients, the mean lifespan of a CVC was 22.4 \u00b1 14.7 months (range, 1.5 to 178 months), and 25% of catheter removals were for thrombotic complications. Typically, TPN catheters are first placed in the SVC by accessing the internal jugular, the brachial, or the subclavian veins. If these veins are no longer accessible, the catheters are usually placed in the inferior vena cava (IVC) via the femoral veins. Femoral catheters are less convenient for the patient and are more susceptible to infection [16] . Other life-threatening complications can be associated with the progressive loss of venous access, including superior vena caval syndrome, pulmonary embolus, and septic thrombi [17] [18] [19] . When all the usual central veins have been exhausted, alternatives include translumbar or transhepatic access to the IVC, or thoracotomy with direct placement of an intra-atrial catheter [20] [21] [22] . Although these aggressive alternative approaches can provide venous access in most patients, they can also be associated with significant complications [17] [18] [19] [20] , and the need for their use is often indicative of a poor overall prognosis.",

Average patient waiting times for intestine transplants range from 285 to 320 days depending on the patient's ABO blood group. For patients on the intestinal transplant waiting list, 78% must wait longer than 3 months, and 44% longer than 1 year, to receive a transplant.

Of the 192 intestinal waiting-list deaths that have occurred since 1993, all but 12 have been in patients who also needed livers. As indicated previously, patients waiting for both a liver and an intestine are allocated organs based on their position on the liver waiting list rather than their position on the intestine waiting list. Priority on the liver waiting list is primarily determined by medical urgency based on standard criteria for determining severity of liver disease (currently Child-Turcotte-Pugh score).

However, in 1998 and 1999, 85% of intestine-liver waiting-list deaths occurred in patients who were prioritized as status 2B or less (Table 2 ). Further analysis of UNOS data indicates that intestineliver candidates have a much higher waiting-list mortality rate than liver transplant candidates of similar status (except status 1) or age ( Table 3 ).

This is extremely problematic in infants, emphasized by the fact that, in 1998 and 1999, the majority of the deaths on the intestine-liver waiting list (66%) occurred in candidates aged under 6 years. In some situations, the donor-recipient size issue can be managed by surgically resecting segments of bowel and/or liver from grafts that would otherwise be too big [30\u2022] .

To facilitate donor hyporesponsiveness or tolerance to the intestinal graft, the simultaneous administration of bone marrow from the same donor has been attempted [36\u2022] . Although this approach has not had any significant impact on early graft loss or mortality, the long-term effects have not been fully evaluated. Better HLA matching between donors and recipients may reduce the need for immunosuppression [37] [38] [39] . Whereas HLA matching improved results in the early kidney transplant experience, with modern immunosuppressive agents the benefit has been obscured except in combinations with no mismatch. However, with intestinal transplants, in which current immunosuppressive agents are not as effective, the benefits of HLA matching may be more significant. Although living donors are especially suitable for HLA matching [37, 38] , matching may also be feasible with cadaveric donors [39] .",

Pretransplant serologies are required in all intestinal transplant candidates to determine if they have been previously exposed to CMV or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Na\u00efve recipients of intestines from CMV-positive donors are at high risk of developing severe CMV infections, especially CMV enteritis [31] . Na\u00efve recipients of EBV-positive organs are at high risk of developing a lymphoproliferative disorder following transplant [41] . Therefore, in intestinal transplant candidates who have not been previously exposed to CMV or EBV, organs from virus-negative donors should be sought. Because the majority of the adult population has been exposed to both of these viruses, this can contribute to longer waiting time. If circumstances dictate that CMVpositive or EBV-positive donors are used, aggressive surveillance of viral activity and/or aggressive use of antiviral agents should be considered [42] . If pretransplant serologies indicate that the candidate has been previously exposed to the virus, the patient is still at moderate risk of virus-related complications regardless of the donor status and should receive antiviral prophylaxis. UNOS has collected both recipient and donor data for intestinal transplants performed since 1990. These data were compiled and published for the first time in the past year and represent the US experience up to September 5, 2000 [2\u2022\u2022] . Data submission to the UNOS registry is mandatory for all accredited transplant centers. Based on UNOS data, the number of intestine-only transplants performed in the United States has increased steadily since 1996. In 1999, there were 36 intestine-only, 20 intestine-liver, and 12 multivisceral (intestine included) transplants performed. The primary diagnoses in these recipients were short-gut syndrome in 64%, functional bowel problems in 26%, graft failure (retransplant) in 6%, and other diagnoses in 4%.",

Early evidence suggests that use of HLAmatched living donors may be associated with less rejection and fewer infectious complications [37, 38] .
