Group testing offers a viable alternative. 4, 5 The idea of this approach is to test samples drawn from multiple people at the same time. If the test is negative, everyone in the group is considered negative; if it returns positive, then at least one individual is infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

Let us compare two methods: individual testing, in which a sample of N people (eg, 220 million) are tested for the virus, and group testing, in which G groups of n individuals are tested. A simple approach is to do onetime pooled sampling to identify negative and positive clusters. Given a prevalence of p we can calculate n. 6 However, we assume the maximum value of n to be 64 or fewer on the basis of a recent laboratory-based study in Israel. 7 Notably, for prevalence estimation, the SARS-CoV-2 status of individuals does not need to be verified, which saves on tests.",

Thus, group testing is 64:1 more efficient than individual testing. Even when prevalence increases (eg, p=10%), we can still see that group testing requires fewer tests than individual testing. Under this scenario, the group size n (a plot of n against p is shown in the appendix [p 1]) can be thought of a measure of relative efficiency of group testing over individual testing in terms of tests needed; even pooling ten swabs will be ten times more efficient than individual testing.",

If one person is affected by SARS-CoV-2, the risk of infection among household members is likely to be very high. 9, 10 In approach 2, the size of the group to be tested is determined to maximise the number of households whose testing shows they are not infected. This approach will allow low-income countries to send healthy people back to work as soon as possible, jointly addressing concerns regarding increased hunger and disease. Such an approach yields n to be the inverse of p. 6 Similar to approach 1, we assume maximum n to be 64 or fewer. If p is 1%, 34\u00b712 million households will be divided among 0\u00b753 million groups of 64 individuals, and 0\u00b753 million tests will be required compared with 220 million needed under an individual-testing approach.

For instance, we could use contact tracing to divide a country into susceptible groups (S), and non-susceptible groups (NS). In that case, we can redo the optimisation so that for S, with a higher p, n will be smaller and G will be larger, and for NS, with a lower p, n will be larger and G will be smaller. Hence, an area with a prevalence of 0\u00b75% or less can be thought of as part of an NS group, and an area with a prevalence of 10% can be thought as being part of an S group (appendix p 1). We can see that our approach yields a more efficient solution to test not only the NS groups, but even the S groups.",
