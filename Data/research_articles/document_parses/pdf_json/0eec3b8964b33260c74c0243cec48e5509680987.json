This is not to suggest that either UNESCO or NISSEM is entirely satisfied with the quality of existing textbooks, but to recognize how little can be done without textbooks for children in the most vulnerable households. Therefore, as soon as what the World Bank (2020) has called the \"coping\" phase of the COVID crisis passes, this strategy should be our highest priority.

Pre-schoolers need school readiness activities that build verbal, motor, and pre-literacy skills, perhaps through play with slightly older children or engagement with grandparents. Early primary learners need face-to-face work and focused practice decoding and comprehending basic texts, which family members with only slightly higher levels of literacy can provide. Late primary and middle school learners may need an authority figure to ensure they persist and complete assignments, maintaining or further developing basic skills. Older students need encouragement to go as far as they can on their own, then to write down their subject-specific questions and look for ways to communicate with people who can provide answers. Finally, for many girls in communities where gender-based harassment and violence are endemic, learning at home or in small neighborhood groups may be their only option to continue their education, even after the crisis has passed. Their caregivers must give them time to study, encouragement to persist and, if their studies advance, help to find acceptable subject-level tutors.",

Households naturally provide many SEL opportunities through play, exploring nature, helping with chores, storytelling, and caring for younger siblings and elders. Guidance to caregivers on how to make SEL activities Sequenced, Active, Focused, and Explicit (SAFE) can increase long-term impact and retention (CASEL 2020; Jukes 2019). Both in school and at home, however, SEL requires positive direction from responsible adults and siblings, to deal promptly with bullying, negative stereotyping, and exclusion of those who are different. Where ICT-based instruction is available, adults may be encouraged to supervise scarce devices, to ensure younger children (especially girls) have adequate access, but, in general, older children may be more adept than their elders at helping younger ones use technology.",

Civil society organization members can canvas their communities to identify households lacking textbooks and other learning materials, then ensure those households receive materials promptly, as Pratham has demonstrated in India (Starkey 2020).

During the current crisis some teachers, particularly those with highly respected roles in rural communities, moved naturally to interface with caregivers and to mobilize volunteers and civil society organizations, in order to support children studying at home. Other teachers and principals need training and coaching to develop unfamiliar community organizing skills. Moreover, mobilizing households in densely populated but fragmented urban neighborhoods may require different skills/approaches than in smaller, stable towns or sparsely populated rural areas.
