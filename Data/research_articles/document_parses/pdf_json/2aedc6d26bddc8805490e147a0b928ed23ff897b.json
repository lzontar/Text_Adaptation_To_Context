            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by a novel 2019 SARS coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, that SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the RaTG13 bat-derived coronavirus (around 88% 53 identity) rather than of SARS-CoV-1 (79% identity) or middle east respiratory syndrome 54 coronavirus MERS-CoV (50% identity) (Lu et al. 2020 ). Due to this association with bat 55 coronaviruses, it was also argued that SARS-CoV-2 virus has the potential to spread into another 56 species, as bat coronaviruses do (Hu et al. 2018) . Recently, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-57 2 is closely related to a pangolin coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV) found in dead Malayan pangolins 58 with a 91.02% identity, the closest relationship found so far for SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al. 59 2020). In that study, genomic analyses revealed that the S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is related 60 closer to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13 coronavirus. Also, five key amino acid residues involved 61 in the interaction with the human ACE2 receptor are maintained in Pangolin-CoV and SARS-62 CoV-2, but not in RaTG13 coronavirus. Thus, it is likely that pangolin species are a natural 63 reservoir of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 will continue to evolve with 64 novel mutations, as the pandemic evolves. Australian SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which were found to be heterogeneous. A mutational signature from USA mutations was however found in an Australian sample, suggesting a world-80 wide spread of this molecular signature consisting of five-point mutations. Remarkably, 81 mutations in the helicase and orf1a proteins of the virus were found more frequently than others, 82 suggesting that these proteins are prone to evolve throughout natural selection. As proof of the 83 latter, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an Australian sample causes a bona-fide stop 84 codon in the helicase protein, strongly suggest this protein will evolve on SARS-CoV-2 in the 85 future. As genetic drift prompts the mutational spectrum of the virus, we recommend frequently Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that rapidly evolves after infection, these evolutionary 241 events will likely affect its fitness over time. In this study, we reveal the early mutational events ",

As SARS-CoV-2 is human-to-human 45 transmitted, it is a threat to the global population. It is critical to understand SARS-CoV-2 46 characteristics to deal with this ongoing pandemic and to develop future treatments. SARS-CoV-47 2 virus is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus with a large genome (29.9 kb) belonging to 48 the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (de Wit et al. 2016). One of the striking genomic 49 features of this novel virus is the presence of a novel furin-like cleavage site in the S-protein of 50 the virus, which differs from SARS-CoV-1 and may have implications for the life cycle and 51 pathogenicity of the novel virus (Coutard et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020a).

            "text": "Supplementary positions 8782 and 28144 are present in 3/11 Australian samples (see Figure 1A, 164 Supplementary Table 1, sheet 1). Notably, one Australian-VIC sample (SRR11397717) 165 displayed the same five-point mutational signature of USA-WA samples, two samples contain 166 the same mutational signature presenting one deletion (SRR11397715 and SRR11397716) and 167 one novel signature (SRR11397728) presents an SNP that creates a stop codon (see Figure 1A, 168 respectively). All of these called variants present mutant allele frequencies near or equal to 169 100%, evidenced in the number of mutant_alleles / reference_alleles (see mutant allele frequency 170 in Supplementary Table 1, sheet 2 and 3, respectively) easily visualized in the aligned bam files 171 (see Figure 1B from USA-WA and Australian-VIC samples, respectively). These analyses 172 suggest these variants were already spread in the infected population in the early days of the 173 outbreak, they are not restricted by country and that they will continue to spread along with the 174 growing cases. To support the latter, we downloaded 436 GenBank sequences of SARS-CoV-2 175 available in NCBI virus database from different countries and we aligned them with the SARS-176 CoV-2 reference genome. Variant calling from these alignment reveals the substantial presence 177 of these USA-WA signature, with allele frequencies ranging 37-46% (see Figure 1B, bottom and 178 Supplementary Table 1, sheet 4). Thus, the USA-WA signature is widespread among SARS-179 CoV-2 infections likely due to founder effect. To figure out whether this signature is enriched in 180 USA samples, we performed the same analysis in a subset of 277 sequences, all of them from 181 USA origin. As expected, the USA-WA signature consisting of five-point mutations are enriched 182 in allele frequencies over 50% plus (see Supplementary Table 1, sheet 5). Also, in these 277 183 sequences, six more variants were detected with smaller allele frequencies as reported for USA-184 WA variants. It is expected that these variants also will rise among infected people in the USA as 185 the USA-WA signature did. A summary of the USA-WA mutational signature is depicted in of variants performed by snippy tool analysis reveals that most of the referred 191 variants in USA-WA and Australia-VIC samples are preferentially missense (63% for USA-WA 192 samples and 74% for Australia-VIC samples, respectively) rather than synonymous (see Figure 193 2A, Supplementary Table 1, sheets 2 and 3, respectively). Focusing on missense variants of 194 USA-WA signature, the most recurrent mutations occurred in the helicase, 3'-to-5' exonuclease 195 and ORF8 protein, accounting for the 81% of missense variants in this signature (see Figure 2B, 196 Supplementary Table 1, sheet 2). These mutations correspond to the five core point mutations 197 observed in USA-WA samples. In the case of Australia-VIC missense samples, the scenario is 198 more complex, due to the heterogeneity of the signatures. Mutations in the orf1a polyprotein, ORF3a protein, helicase and surface glycoprotein account for 69% of the missense variants 200 present in the Australia-VIC signatures. Importantly, two Australian samples (SRR11397715 and 201 SRR11397716) present the same mutational profiling with deletions in the stem loop of the virus 202 and notably, one sample (SRR11397728) presents an SNP that created a stop codon in the 203 helicase protein (see Supplementary Table 1, sheet 3). Since every USA-WA and Australia-204 VIC sample that presents variants in the helicase gene contains at least one missense variant, this 205 evidence strongly suggests that this gene is under active evolution it will likely continue to 206 evolve along with SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 207 208 SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 can diminish efficiency of RT-qPCR testing. 209 210 We downloaded the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention primer list, consisting of three 211 primer sets designed against ORF9 structural protein (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein), each one 212 with a fluorescent probe for reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (see 213 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html and 214 https://github.com/cfarkas/SARS-CoV-19_illumina_analysis, file CDC_primers.fasta). We 215 investigated if these primers hybridized at positions with the variants reported herein from the 30 216 next-generation sequencing datasets. We aligned these primer sequences with SARS-CoV-2 217 reference genome and the 30 analyzed samples. We found two Australian clonal samples 218 (SRR11397719 and SRR11397721) presenting one founder synonymous SNP (position 28688) 219 that falls into the 2019_nCoV_N2_Forward_Primer hybridization region. In the first sample, we 220 also found an SNP with low allele frequency that falls into the 2019-nCoV_N1_Reverse_Primer 221 (see Figure 3). We also challenged a list of primers available from literature (16), primers 222 currently used for the Institute Pasteur, Hong Kong University and ten primers obtained from 223 primer-blast (see Material and Methods for sources) against 206 variants consisting in GenBank 224 variants collected from USA samples including variants from the next-generation sequencing 225 datasets employed here (see Supplementary Table 1, sheet 6). Of these, CDC primer set 2019-226nCoV_N3 forward and reverse along with its probe were discarded again, due to potential 227 reduced efficiency during priming. Similarly, sets 2, 3 and 8 from primer-blast, were discarded.228Conversely, primers from Pasteur Institute and Hong-Kong university passed the filter, 229 respectively. Thus, increasing variation in SARS-CoV-2 can confound quantitative RT-qPCR in 230 the future depending on the primer design.",

            "text": "242 in small samples from mainly two geographically unrelated populations (Washington, USA, and 243 Victoria, Australia) and we compared these results with variants observed in submitted GenBank 244 sequences in NCBI viral portal, from different countries. As already reported with HIV and 245 Chikungunya outbreaks, the founder effect of five-point mutations was observed in almost all 246 USA-WA samples obtained by next-generation sequencing. These mutations also have a high 247 allele frequency (around 50%) in SARS-CoV-2 GenBank sequences from USA origin (Foley et 248 al. 2000; Tsetsarkin et al. 2011). These mutational signatures are likely to be overrepresented 249 among Washington infections and USA infections overall, if not globally. Supporting this, the 250 alignment of 435 submitted sequences to NCBI virus from different countries (March 31, 2020) 251 shows allele frequencies of 37-46% of these five SNPs across samples worldwide. These SNPs 252 cause missense mutations on helicase, 3'-to-5' exonuclease and ORF8 proteins. In the case of 253 Victoria samples from Australia, samples ranging from one single SNP up to eleven were found. 254 In the early beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan city (between December 18-29, 2019), one to 255 four mutations arose in the virus per patient (Shen et al. 2020), arguing that the number of fixed 256 mutations in the world population is rapidly increasing where the infection has spread. 257 Importantly, one Australian sample sequenced by next generation sequencing presented the 258 USA-WA signature, suggesting that this signature is already propagated with the worldwide 259 pandemic. Clonal mutational events within Australian samples were also observed and probably 260 are widespread in the region. One interesting feature of the mutations in this limited number of 261 samples is the evolutionary pressure undergone helicase gene. RNA helicases display various 262 functions in genome replication, and it has been proposed as a therapeutic target to inhibit 263 coronaviruses among other viruses with small molecules (Briguglio et al. 2011). Helicase 264 evolution in SARS-CoV-2 could be rapidly occurring, making it unfeasible to drug this protein 265 in the future. As genetic drift is allowing SARS-CoV-2 to evolve while the pandemic is still 266 growing, the amplification efficiency of quantitative RT-qPCR tests is challenged since a single 267 mutation even in the middle of a primer can be detrimental for PCR efficiency (Bru et al. 2008), 268 potentially contributing to false negative results in COVID-19 testing. For this issue, we 269 provided a way to compute the latter, by merging all variant sites called across studied samples 270 and intersect them across primer sets available both in literature and currently in use. As new 271 mutations can be spread depending on the founder effect, we firmly urge that primer sets for 272 clinical testing should be tested in this way continuously, according to the current mutations 273 found at the particular time and in the specific population which needs to be diagnosed with 274 SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

SARS-CoV-2 Australian mutations were heterogeneous, but still, clonal 287 events were found.

            "text": "In this scenario, it is expected that diverse signatures of viral variants spread among different populations in the world. Recently, thousands of GenBank sequences from SARS-CoV-19 available at the NCBI virus database were trackable by region, suggesting that the transmission occurred mainly through clonal events due to clustering of the available sequences (Chen et al. 2020; Kupferschmidt 2020) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Protein&VirusLineage_ss=S ARS-CoV-2,%20taxid:2697049). As a proof of concept, in the early beginning of the outbreak in China, sequencing the virus from nine patients from Wuhan in China revealed 99.9% similarity among samples. That finding suggests 2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very short time, supporting clonality of spreading (Lu et al. 2020). In this study, we characterized the early mutational events across 30 high-quality datasets publicly available on the sequence read archive repository. 27 out of 30 samples (90%) contain at least a single founder mutation and most of the variants across samples are missense (over 63%).
