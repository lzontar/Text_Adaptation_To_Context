            "text": "The analysis of complex longitudinal data such as COVID-19 deaths is challenging due to several inherent features: (i) Similarly-shaped profiles with different decay patterns; (ii) Unexplained variation among repeated measurements within each country, these repeated measurements may be viewed as clustered data since they are taken on the same country at roughly the same time; (iii) Skewness, outliers or skew-heavy-tailed noises are possibly embodied within response variables. This article formulates a robust nonlinear mixed-effects model based in the class of scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions for modeling COVID-19 deaths, which allows the analysts to model such data in the presence of the above described features simultaneously. An efficient EM-type algorithm is proposed to carry out maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. The bootstrap method is used to determine inherent characteristics of the nonlinear individual profiles such as confidence interval of the predicted deaths and fitted curves. The target is to model COVID-19 deaths curves from some Latin American countries since this region is the new epicenter of the disease. Moreover, since a mixed-effect framework borrows information from the population-average effects, in our analysis we include some countries from Europe and North America that are in a more advanced stage of their COVID-19 deaths curve.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, most models developed up to this date are univariate, not taking into account a possible structure of dependence on the disease among countries or regions.

            "text": "In recent years, nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models have been proposed for modeling many complex longitudinal data (Lindstrom and Bates, 1990; Wu, 2010) . However, one often assumes that both random error and random effects are normally distributed, which may not always give reliable results if the data exhibit excessive skewness and heavy tailedness, as is the case of COVID-19 deaths data. In this paper, we present a novel class of asymmetric NLME models that provides an efficient estimation of the parameters in the analysis of longitudinal data. We assume that, marginally, the random effects follow a scale mixtures of skew-normal distribution (SMSN, Branco and Dey, 2001) and that the random errors follow a symmetric scale mixtures of normal distribution (SMN, Lange and Sinsheimer, 1993) providing an appealing robust alternative to the usual normal distribution in NLME models. We propose an approximate likelihood analysis for maximum likelihood (ML) estimation via an EM-type algorithm that produces accurate ML estimates and significantly reduces the numerical difficulty associated with the exact ML estimation. The newly approximate procedures are applied to COVID-19 deaths data and it is showed that models with skewheavy-tailed assumption may provide more reasonable results and these may be important for COVID-19 research in providing quantitative guidance to better understand the stages and future development of the disease.",

As it can be seen, the curves have difficulties to capture the rapid increase in deaths in some countries but overall provide a reasonable fit.

We generate M random samples of length n of the model (eq. 5-6) using the estimated parameters and for each random sample, we fit the proposed model and calculate the statistical mode, the fitted and predicted curve ( Y t ). So, for each country, we will have M o 1 , ..., M o M estimates of the mode and Y t1 , ..., Y t M . We calculate the percentiles \u03b1/2 and 1 \u2212 \u03b1/2 to construct a confidence interval of level \u03b1 for the mode and for the fitted curve of the COVID-19 deaths.

For model selection, we consider AIC and BIC, as described in Section 3.3, for distributions normal (N), skew-normal (SN), student's-t (t), and skew-t (ST). As shown in Table 1 , the distribution with lowest AIC and BIC is the ST, which will be used in the analysis hereafter. It is worth noting that the fitted ST distribution has \u03bd = 1.568 (Table 2) , evidencing the need for heavy tail models. To obtain long term evolution estimates, we computed the 300-days-ahead prediction for all countries considered in this study. Figure 2 presents the fitted model, along with the prediction, the real data and confidence intervals information. To preserve the individual properties observed for each country, the random error was generated conditioned on the mixing scale factor u i = E{U i | \u03b8, y i }, i = 1, . . . , 9, which is estimated as a byproduct of the EM algorithm and is responsible to preserve the observed characteristics of the series for each country. Additionally, the 95% confidence intervals were obtained as described in Subsection 3.5, where M = 600 samples were generated, from which the model estimate or prediction for 13 samples resulted in numerical error and/or non-convergence. For the 587 remaining samples we performed a 15% trim of the series to remove those noise series that were not able to replicate the characteristics of the data. To identify such series we used as metric the mean square error (MSE) between the fitted values and observed data and removed those such that the MSE have the highest values. This procedure was performed to prevent convergence problems to affect the interval estimates, resulting in a final of 499 samples. 3.800 \u03bb 2 13.915 \u03bd 1.568 q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q Peak: Apr 12 Peak 95% CI: (Apr 05, Apr 21) q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q Peak: Apr 22 Peak 95% CI: (Apr 14, May 02) q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q Peak: Jun 16 Peak 95% CI: (May 29, Jul 27) q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q Peak: Apr 01 Peak 95% CI: (Mar 27, Apr 08) q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q Peak: Jun 08 Peak 95% CI: (May 24, Jun 27) q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q Peak: Aug 17 Peak 95% CI: (Jun 10, Apr 20)",

On the other hand, for countries in early stage such as Chile and Colombia, the uncertainty regarding the disease evolution is much bigger, which is reflected by the wider confidence intervals and very vague information about the peak. Table 3 reports predictions for the total number of deaths for each country and up to 30, 60, 90, and 150-days-ahead of the date from the latest observation considered (2020-06-24), using the fitted ST-NLME model (our selected model), along with its 95% confidence interval, obtained from the bootstrap results. As can be seen, based on the observed data, the European countries and the US have the deaths by COVID-19 practically controlled, since the death estimates are stable in all future prediction times. Brazil, Mexico and Peru are around its peak (Figure 3 ). Their prediction mildly increase with time and they present a little more imprecision as observed by their 95% confidence interval estimates if compared to the controlled countries. Finally, Chile and Colombia seem to be in the increasing phase. The predicted number of deaths changes drastically between the time intervals with a wide uncertainty. Table 4 shows the total estimated number of deaths at the end of the pandemic and the estimated peak date by each country. This results corroborates and reinforce the analysis presented in the previous paragraph. Moreover, Table 4 presents the estimates of the parameters of the logistic dynamic of the model. As it can be seen,\u03b1 4 1 showing a large right skewness for the pandemic dynamics. In other words, the increase phase occurs much faster than the decrease phase as observed in many places. This is a clear effect of borrowing strength from curves in different stages. For example, for the curves from the Latin American countries, where observations are mainly on the left side of the Table 3 : Prediction for 30, 60, 90, and 150-days-ahead of the total number of deaths using the fitted ST-NLME model.

Understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and being able to predict its future behavior is of extreme importance. While many countries and consortia try to create an effective vaccine for the disease, the best current alternative is to flatten the contamination curve to guarantee that the health systems are able to provide the necessary care for the population without being overwhelmed. With the use of countries that have controlled the pandemic number of deaths we strongly believe that our methodology can provide more reliable and meaningful prediction that allow policies makers in Latin America to make effective decisions.",

A possible alternative to overcome this fact is to incorporate into modeling time changing covariates that adequately capture the subnotification dynamics of each country. Another interesting future development and work is to model the cases and deaths by COVID-19 jointly since these series are necessarily correlated. Moreover, the WHO has warned that the coronavirus may never go away and concerns are growing about a second (perhaps a third) wave of infections. Thus, a natural generalization of our method is to consider a finite mixture of SMSN-NLME models (Lachos et al., 2017; Zeller et al., 2019 ). An in-depth investigation of such extensions are beyond the scope of the present paper, but certainly an interesting topic for (near) future research.",
