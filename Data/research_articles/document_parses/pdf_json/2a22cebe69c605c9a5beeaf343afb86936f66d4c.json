One hundred twenty chickens were randomly divided into 5 groups. Groups 3 to 4 received intramuscular injection of cyclophosphamide to induce oxidative stress and immunosuppression. After that, groups 2 and 4 were orally administered tea saponins in drinking water for 7 d. Then, groups 1 to 4 were immunized with a live, bivalent vaccine of Newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus. Blood samples were collected for analysis of oxidative parameters and specific antibody titers, and splenocytes were prepared for lymphocyte proliferative assay. The results showed that adminis-tration of tea saponins significantly increased total antioxidant capacity, total superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, ascorbic acid, and \u03b1-tocopherol, and decreased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl. Enhanced immune responses, such as lymphocyte proliferation induced by concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharides, and serum Newcastle disease virus-and infectious bronchitis virus-specific antibodies were also observed in chickens injected with or without cyclophosphamide. In addition, no side effects were found in chickens throughout the study. Therefore, tea saponins may be a potential agent to improve imunosuppression induced by oxidative stress in chickens.",

            "text": "Oxidative stress is caused by the imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants at either cellular or individual level (Volj\u010d et al., 2011) . During the normal respiration, oxygen is progressively reduced to yield water (Panda and Cherian 2013) . However, the incomplete reduction of oxygen during this process leads to formation of chemical entities that have powerful oxidizing properties and is known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) . ROS are constantly produced in vivo during the course of physiological metabolism in living tissues. Over production or insufficient elimination of ROS will lead to oxidative stress (Yu et al., 2015b) . Oxidative stress constitutes an important factor of biological damage and is regarded as the cause of several pathological conditions that affect growth and development (Avanzo et al., 2001; Iqbal et al., 2001) , and it may predispose to the development of cancer (Kim et al., 2014) , diabetes (Gomes 2014) , and cardiovascular diseases (Chan and Chan 2013 Various stresses are responsible for decreasing productive and reproductive performance of growing chickens in the commercial poultry industry. When oxidative stress is more severe, the pro-oxidant systems outbalance the antioxidant systems, potentially producing oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids, ultimately leading to cell death (Surai 2000) . Such uncontrolled oxidative reactions also can result in severe oxidative stress and metabolic diseases (Tav\u00e1rez et al., 2011) . Therefore, decreasing oxidative stress is very important to maintain feed and food quality and enhance bird health and welfare. Less effective immune responses were found after vaccination in some cases, such as individuals influenced by oxidative stress and numerous other factors (Peyre et al., 2009 ). Therefore, it is necessary to improve the immunization with currently available vaccines so as to effectively protect the host from infections.",

            "text": "The medicinal use of tea has a long history in Asian countries such as China, Japan, India and Thailand. Tea is the most widely consumed beverage, second only to water, with a per capita worldwide consumption of approximately 0.12 liter per d (Pastore and Fratellone 2006) . Tea seeds and leaves contain variety of biological active compounds like polyphenols, saponins, vitamins, oil minerals, and trace elements (Cabrera et al., 2003) . The main antioxidants in tea are saponins, 3058 catechins, flavonols, tannins, and phenolic compounds. The antioxidant properties of green tea polyphenols and the pro-oxidant effects of these compounds have been recommended as potential candidates for cancer prevention (Yashin et al., 2011) . The beneficial effects of tea have been attributed to its strong antioxidant activity (Jang et al., 2007) . Recently, saponins isolated from ginseng stem-leaf (GSLS) have been found to be an immune-stimulating agent in chickens (Zhai et al., 2011a,b; Zhai et al., 2014) . GSLS not only affected oxidative stress but also improved immune responses in chickens (Yu et al., 2015a,b) . Therefore, we hypothesized that tea saponins (TS) have both antioxidative and immunomodulatory properties. At the present study, we evaluated the effect of TS on the antioxidative activities as well as the immune responses to a live bivalent vaccine of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccine in chickens in oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide (Cy).",

Chickens in groups 3 and 4 received intramuscular injection of Cy at 100 mg/kg body weight (BW) for 3 d to induce immunosuppression. Groups 1, 2, and 5 were injected with saline solution in the same way as groups 3 and 4. Then, groups 2 and 4 were orally administered TS of 5 mg/kg BW in drinking water for 7 d. Similar way to Yu et al (2015b) was used to administration of TS. To make the chickens drink the TS water sufficiently, the birds were kept thirsty for 2 h before TS medication. Groups 5 were not medicated and served as a control (Table 1 ). After that, group 1 to 4 were intranasally immunized twice with a live bivalent vaccine of NDV and IBV at 2-wk intervals. Blood samples were collected before Cy treatment and 7, 14, and 21 d after immunization for analysis of oxidative parameters, as well as measurement of NDV-specific HI titers and IBV-specific antibody titers. Splenocytes were prepared from 6 birds of each group before Cy treatment and 7, 14, and 21 d after immunization for lymphocyte proliferative assay. The dose of TS used in this study was based on our previous investigation where 5 mg/kg was found optimal to enhance the serum specific HI response to NDV vaccine when chickens were orally administered TS at the doses of 3, 5, 7, and 9 mg/kg.",

Overproduction or insufficient elimination of ROS will lead to oxidative stress (Yu et al., 2015b) . There are enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense mechanisms in the body. Enzymatic antioxidant defenses include total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and catalase (CAT). Both T-SOD and CAT can degrade O 2 and decompose H 2 O 2 , and result in a decrease in oxidative stress, which is an effective way of cell protection from damage (Nagi and Almakki 2009) . Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) is an enzyme responsible for scavenging ROS and its oxidation products to protect the body from lipid peroxidation (LPO) (Cui et al., 2010) . The major function of GSH-PX, which uses glutathione as a substrate, is to reduce soluble hydrogen peroxide and alkyl peroxides (Bebe and Panemangalore 2003) . All these enzymes work together to eliminate active oxygen species, and small deviations in physiological concentrations may have a dramatic effect on the resistance of cellular lipids, proteins, and DNA to oxidative damage (Ince et al., 2012) .",

The depletion of GSH due to Cy treatment will reduce its cellular level and lead to induction of oxidative stress (Yuan et al., 1991; Yousefipour et al., 2005) . VC is a water-soluble antioxidant that helps to reduce the effect of oxidative stress (Eroglu et al., 2013) . VC can easily react with free radicals in extracellular body fluids, as it is water soluble (Bendich 1990) . VC exerts its antioxidant effects in both direct and indirect ways. VC directly scavenges the free radicals formed as a byproduct of metabolic reactions (Dawson et al., 1990) . In an indirect way, VC helps recycling of oxidized VE, thus supplying active VE to fight against LPO (Netke et al., 1997) . In addition, there are many studies demonstrating that VE protects cell membranes by preventing LPO. \u03b1-Tocopherol reacts with peroxyl radicals depending on its methylation state of the chromanol ring and the saturation grade of the side chain, forming tocopheroxyl radicals (Brigeliusfloh\u00e9 2009 ). Tocopheroxyl radicals are converted to tocopherols by re-acting with ascorbate (May et al., 1998) . VE has been shown to play a role in various enzymes activities by enabling their translocation to the membrane (Kempn\u00e1 et al., 2004) or affecting their transcriptional activation process (Khor et al., 2000) . In many studies, VE neutralizes LPO and unsaturated membrane lipids because of its oxygen scavenging effect (Aldana et al., 2001; John et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "Cyclophosphamide (Cy) is a cytotoxic alkylating agent with a wide of clinical uses and has been proved to be effective originally used in the treatment of some types of cancers and nonmalignant diseases. Cy is transformed in the liver into active metabolites (4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, aldophosphamide, phosphoramide mustard, and others), which interfere with cellular DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, thus leading to cell death (Perini et al., 2007) . In the early study, Cy has been found to increase superoxide anion and H 2 O 2 formation in cultured rat hepatocytes (Fuhrman et al., 1997) and different kidney cells (Hussein et al., 2005) and induce oxidative stress and lipoperoxidation (Reiter et al., 1999) . The deleterious effects of Cy was, at least in part, due to the increased production of free radicals and ROS, which is associated with enhanced ROS generation and oxidative stress (Maestroni and Conti 1989) . Thus Cy is frequently used to induce oxidative stress models (Tripathi and Jena 2009; Oboh et al., 2011) . In addition, Cy has been reported to suppress both cellular and humoral immune responses (Bear 1986; Hoover et al., 1990) , such as inhibiting lymphocyte activity and specific antibodies to NDV and IBV (Reynolds and Maraqa 1999; Loa et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2011) . In this study, injection of Cy generated oxidative stress and lowered immune responses by reducing antioxidant enzymes such as T-AOC, T-SOD, GSH, and CAT, as well as inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation and antibody responses to vaccination. Decreased antioxidant activities in animals due to Cy were reported in other studies (Popovic et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2010; Ognjanovi\u0107 et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2015b) .",

            "text": "Oral administration of ginseng stem-leaf saponins has recently been reported to reduce oxidative stress induced by Cy in chickens (Yu et al., 2015b) . Similarly, reduced oxidative stress in chickens by oral administration of TS was found in this study. A stressful condition is closely related to the immune system. During oxidative stress, the excessive production of free radicals results in an imbalance in the oxidant system, and suppresses the immune function (Kucinski 1990 ). The immune system is particularly sensitive to stress and specific effects of stress have been demonstrated by a number of studies (Mastorakos and Ilias 2000; Wu et al., 2000; Mcewen 2001 ). The immune responses can be improved by removing immunosuppression (Srikumar 2006 ). In the present study, the increased antioxidant activities by oral administration of TS paralleled the enhanced immune responses to vaccination. TS-treatment significantly increased serum antibodies to NDV and IBV as well as the lymphocyte proliferation induced by ConA and LPS. Newcastle disease and infectious bronchitis virus infection are fatal and could result in large amount of economic losses in poultry industry (Callison et al., 2007; Ge et al., 2007) . Immunization using live, attenuated vaccines is a common practice for the control of NDV and IBV in birds (Seto et al., 1974; Gelb et al., 1998) . Figure 4 showed that oral administration of TS improved antibody responses to NDV and IBV in the birds in healthy and immune-suppressed by Cy. The enhanced immune responses could be due to reduction in oxidative stress resulting from oral administration of TS.",

Oral administration of TS at a dose of 5 mg/kg BW significantly improved the antioxidant activity, as indicated by increasing T-AOC, T-SOD, CAT, GSH-PX, GSH, VC, VE, as well as by decreasing MDA and the protein carbonyl. The increased antioxidant activity paralleled increased specific antibody responses to NDV and IBD vaccine, lymphocyte proliferative responses induced by ConA and LPS. Considering TS has its antioxidant activity and plentiful resources, TS may be a potential agent to relieve oxidative stress in immunosuppressed chickens in poultry industry.",
