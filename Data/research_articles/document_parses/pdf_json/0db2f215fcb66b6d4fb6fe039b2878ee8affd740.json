For instance, the article forecasted that the number of infections in Wuhan would reach 75,815 on January 25, 2020, but the actual number was simply 618. 3 Therefore, it is indispensable to establish a new dynamic model of the epidemic to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures in Wuhan ( Fig. 1 ) .",

Epidemic prevention and control in Wuhan can be divided into three stages: the first stage was the natural occurrence and spread of the epidemic from January 18 to January 23; the second stage was the blockade of Wuhan and the advocacy of residents going out less from January 23 to February 5; and the third stage was cabin hospitals put into use from February 6 to February 13 to ensure that all cases are admitted to hospitals and close contacts are under intensive medical observation. We used the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) dynamic model 6 to simulate the spread of the epidemic and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to identify optimal parameters. 7 The formula of SEIR model is as follows: ",

The results showed that the effective reproduction number after blockade of the city was R T = 1.12, showing that blockade reduced transmission of infection by 66.16%. Although the adopted prevention and control measureswere effective, the effective reproduction number remained greater than 1, indicating that the epidemic continues to spread. This could be attributable to medical limitations: not all patients could be admitted to hospitals, and close contacts were mainly isolated at home, resulting in family outbreaks. Since February 6, cabin hospitalshave been put into use to ensure that all cases are admitted to hospitals and close contacts are under intensive medical observation. Consequently, the effective reproduction number has decreased to less than 1 (R T = 0 \u2022 71), indicating the inflection point of the epidemic; thus, the incidence of the disease will gradually decrease until its disappearance.",
