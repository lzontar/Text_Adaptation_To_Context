Methods A consecutive series of patients who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy under laryngosuspension were reviewed for outcomes. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and laryngosuspension. An 8.5 oral endotracheal tube is inserted and the cuff is inflated in the supraglottis, allowing access to the whole trachea and subglottis. The tube is taped to the laryngoscope. A rigid endoscope is inserted in the endotracheal tube through a swivel connector connected to the tube and the ventilation circuit. Percutaneous tracheostomy kit is used to perform dilatational tracheostomy at the desired level of the trachea under direct visual endoscopic control. Results Forty-eight patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy under laryngosuspension. Thirty-two cases were performed in an emergency after securing the airway with endotracheal intubation. In all other cases, tracheostomy was performed as a part of an elective procedure affecting the airway or in patients requiring prolonged ventilation. More than half of patients were considered high risk by virtue of one or more of the following: morbid obesity, prior neck surgery, prior neck radiotherapy, progressive head and neck cancer, or laryngotracheal stenosis. Complications occurred in seven cases. Conclusion Percutaneous tracheostomy under laryngosuspension has the advantage of optimal control of patient ventilation and hemostasis throughout the procedure. High-quality endoscopic vision and easy access to the airway under laryngosuspension allow tracheostomy to be performed with maximum safety.",

            "text": "Shelden made the first attempts of percutaneous tracheostomy in 1955 [2] . Percutaneous tracheostomy with a dilatation system was proposed by Ciaglia in 1985 [3] . It then became a safe technique and was adopted as an alternative to conventional surgical tracheostomy. It is characterized by the use of a dilatation kit and endoscopic control during the procedure [4] [5] [6] . This procedure is mainly performed in intensive care units, in patients requiring prolonged ventilation [7] . Percutaneous tracheostomy has several advantages over conventional surgical tracheostomy: reduced operative time, reduced risk of intra-and postoperative bleeding, reduced risk of infection of the surgical site, lower cost, and reduced time of spontaneous tracheostomy stoma closure after decannulation. The overall complication rate of both techniques seems to be identical [8] [9] [10] . Several contraindications to percutaneous tracheostomy have been reported: pediatric population, unsafe airway, emergency, presence of a median cervical lesion, non-palpable cricoid cartilage, and coagulopathy [5] . Airway emergencies are characterized by urgency and unpredictability that need a clear process to be followed so that the airway can managed rapidly [11] . The following factors further increase the difficulty of emergency airway management: (I) lack of information on detailed medical history without enough time to get complete thorough physical examination before needing to act; (II) lack of preparation: the decision to establish an artificial airway is often made suddenly and preparation time is usually short, which means a comprehensive preparation cannot be relied upon at every intubation; (III) lack of compliance: emergency patients may have difficulty in cooperating [11] .",

            "text": "Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy under laryngosuspension can be performed in the context of emergency or elective surgery. Two thirds of our procedures were performed in an emergency setting of acute dyspnea, which was previously considered as a contraindication to dilatational percutaneous tracheostomy. In our series, first, the airway was accessed with the appropriate intubation modality then percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy under laryngosuspension was performed. This needs appropriate experience with all intubation modalities in order to be prepared to manage any difficult airway to avoid performance of awake open tracheostomy. The latter is considered as a stressful condition for the patient, the surgeon and the anesthesiologist in case of any delay in securing the airway due to distorted neck anatomy or difficult surgical approach to the trachea. In most of emergency cases of our series, the airway was first intubated with a small endotracheal tube and then laryngosuspension was performed allowing permanent access to the airway during the whole procedure and safe endotracheal tube exchange with a larger one (ID: 8.5) permitting adequate ventilation of the patient while inserting a rigid telescope in the endotracheal tube. In traditional percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy with flexible endoscopic control, smaller endotracheal tubes are used and this may result in ventilatory compromise secondary to partial obstruction of the small tubes by the endoscope. In addition, laryngosuspension allows easy examination of the airway and the performance of biopsies in case of malignant airway obstruction. Finally, laryngosuspension and taping the endotracheal tube to the laryngoscope allows retraction of the distal end of the tube to the laryngeal inlet and inflation of its cuff in the supraglottis, without any fear to lose the airway, thus permitting visualization of the majority of the airway starting from the subglottis. No damage or injury to the true vocal folds occurred in our series as the balloon of the endotracheal tube was inflated within the supraglottis and only the distal tip of the tube was inserted at the level of the glottis. In our series, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy under laryngosuspension was performed in the OR while most of the series of percutaneous tracheostomy under laryngosuspension described in the literature are performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients requiring prolonged ventilation [10, 13] . The advantage of performing the procedure in the OR is the presence of a technical platform that allows dealing with any complication. In addition, it allows easy access to flexible and rigid instrumentation for intubation with maximal security of patients with airway emergencies. The disadvantage remains a higher cost than a procedure performed in the ICU [8] . In contrast, we have to remind that in the actual context of COVID-19 pandemic, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy under laryngosuspension could be an alternative to open tracheostomy in patients with prolonged ventilation secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome, not candidate for traditional percutaneous tracheostomy. In this setting, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy under laryngosuspension could be performed in ICU to avoid transfer of infected patients to the OR to diminish the risk of COVID-19 spread during transportation.",

            "text": "Most obese patients have very short, thick necks. Obesity makes for challenging airway access regardless of the technique used. Palpation of anatomic landmarks often reveals a short cricostenal distance. In addition, neck extension might not help or could be limited. Open surgical tracheostomy in these patients are notoriously difficult with the trachea oriented obliquely and posteriorly within the thorax. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy under laryngosuspension is far easier and safer than open tracheostomy or conventional percutaneous tracheostomy in these patients. In addition, it might require the use of an extended length tracheostomy cannula which is not usually supplied with the set of percutaneous tracheostomy [15] . The surgeon should always be prepared to introduce an endotracheal tube, either through the laryngoscope from above or directly into the wound itself, in the event that passage of the tracheostomy tube is not initially successful [13] . This is facilitated by the laryngosuspension that provides stable and easy access to the airway. Although we have been ready for this possibility, thus far it has not been necessary. In our series, 27% of patients were overweight with a maximum BMI of 33.3. No patient was morbidly obese (BMI > 35). We did not encounter any particular difficulty in patients with overweight. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy under laryngosuspension appears to be a good alternative in overweight patients. This is confirmed in American series with a mean BMI of 28.1 [13, 15, 16] . In our series, no patients had coagulation disorders. However, percutaneous tracheostomy could be performed in patients with bleeding disorders defined as INR > 1.5, or platelet count < 50,000/mm 3 , or receiving curative anticoagulation treatment with heparin [16, 17] . Laryngosuspension allows endoscopic control of hemostasis in case of bleeding using large-bore suction rigid instrumentation, tamponade, and monopolar or bipolar electrocautery.",

This complication rate is comparable to that of other teams using similar technique and appears to be lower than conventional percutaneous tracheostomy techniques despite the great heterogeneity of the average rates of complications estimated between 9.2 and 37.4% in published series [10, 13, 15, 18, 19] . In our series, complications occurred in patients with no intubation difficulties and with various tracheostomy indications. In our experience, we did not find any risk factor predictive for complications. In general, the main complication in percutaneous tracheostomy is inadvertent decannulation which enables the tip of the cannula to fall out entirely or to sit within a false passage anterior to the tracheal lumen [8] . For this reason, we recommend to stitch the tracheostomy tube to the skin and to perform the first cannula change at least on post-operative day 5. In our series, no complications were observed regarding posterior tracheal wall injury during the procedure. This could be explained by the fact that the rigid telescope provides improved direct optical visualization. Finally, complications such as pneumothorax or major subcutaneous emphysema did not occur in our series.",
