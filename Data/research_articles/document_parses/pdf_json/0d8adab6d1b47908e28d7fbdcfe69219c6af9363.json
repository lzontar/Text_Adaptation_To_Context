Morpholinos are typically used to inhibit translation of mRNA, splicing of pre-mRNA, and maturation of miRNA, although they can also inhibit other interactions between biological macromolecules and RNA. Morpholinos are effective, specific, and lack non-antisense effects. They work in any cell that transcribes and translates RNA. However, unmodified Morpholinos do not pass well through plasma membranes and must therefore be delivered into the nuclear or cytosolic compartment to be effective. Morpholinos form stable base pairs with complementary nucleic acid sequences but apparently do not bind to proteins to a significant extent. They are not recognized by proteins and do not undergo protein-mediated catalysis; nor do they mediate RNA cleavage by RNase H or the RISC complex.

Figure 26 .8.1 illustrates the structure of three Morpholino subunits joined by inter-subunit linkages. The morpholino phosphorodiamidate backbone of Morpholinos consists of morpholine rings that bear methylene groups and are bound through modified phosphates in which the anionic oxygen is replaced by a nonionic dimethylamino group. The substituted phosphate is bound through an oxygen atom to the morpholine's exocyclic methylene group, and through a phosphorus-nitrogen bond to the nitrogen atom of another morpholine ring. One standard DNA nucleobase (adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine) is bound to each morpholine ring. The ends of Morpholinos are conventionally named 3 and 5 by analogy with the nomenclature for nucleic acids (although if one were to number the atoms of a morpholino oligonucleotide backbone by IUPAC rules, the numbers assigned to the ends would be different).

Practitioners of nuclear medicine strive to minimize radiation exposure of a patient while delivering radionuclides to target tissues for imaging or for therapeutic applications. By attaching radioisotopes to antibodies that are specific for target tissues, the antibodies can anchor isotopes on these tissues. Because the large antibody molecules diffuse slowly, the isotopes must be maintained in the plasma at high concentrations or for long durations to achieve good delivery of radioisotope-linked antibodies to their targets. Pretargeting with Morpholinos involves introducing an antibody-Morpholino conjugate into the bloodstream; this can be done using high concentrations or re-dosing to saturate the target without exposing the patient to radiation during this pretargeting stage. Next, a conjugate of a radioisotope (possibly chelated) with a complementary Morpholino is added to the blood. Because the Morpholino has a much smaller molecular mass than an antibody, the radionuclide-Morpholino conjugate diffuses relatively quickly and is captured at the target tissue more rapidly through Morpholino-Morpholino pairing. Unbound radionuclide-Morpholino conjugate is rapidly eliminated through the kidneys. This technique allows delivery of radioisotopes to the targeted tissue while exposing the organism to lower doses of radiation away from the targeted region. In the process of developing these techniques, pharmacokinetics of Morpholinoradionuclide conjugates have been studied in vivo (Liu et al., 2002a,b; He et al., 2003) .

If small selfcomplementary sequences are separated by zero to a few bases, formation of a stable stemloop is unlikely because a hairpin with a small loop is not energetically favored. To prevent loss of oligo activity through competition between self-pairing and target binding, it is prudent to limit self-complementary sequences in oligo designs to 16 contiguous hydrogen bonds or less, where CG pairs contribute 3 hydrogen bonds and AT pairs contribute 2 hydrogen bonds. For instance, the short sequences ATGGC and GCCAT can form 13 contiguous hydrogen bonds (2+2+3+3+3 = 13). When analyzing sequences for self-complementarity, check for both Watson-Crick base-pairing and for GT base-pairing. Like an AT pair, a GT pair also forms two hydrogen bonds. However, because the overall stability of the GT pair is far lower than an AT pair, a GT pair can be scored as a single hydrogen bond when calculating its contribution to the stability of a self-complementary moiety (Aboul-ela et al., 1985 ). An oligo containing a self-complimentary sequence can form dimers. To prevent loss of oligo activity through competition between dimer formation and target binding, it is prudent to limit complimentary palindromes to 16 contiguous hydrogen bonds or less. For instance, if two oligos bearing the self-complimentary sequence AT-GCATGCGT encounter each other, they can form 22 contiguous hydrogen bonds (2+1+3+3+2+2+3+3+1+2 = 22, taking into account the GT pairs) and would likely have poor antisense activity.

Carboxyfluorescein is a green-emitting fluorophore that was chosen from among the fluoresceins for its good chemical stability. While its photostability is better than that of many of the fluoresceins, all of the fluoresceins are subject to photobleaching, so carboxyfluorescein should not be exposed to intense light unnecessarily. The excitation wavelength of a carboxyfluoresceinated Morpholino in water is 502 nm, and its emission wavelength is 525 nm. Carboxyfluorescein has two negative charges at neutral pH.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "End modifications"}, {"text": "Lissamine. Lissamine is a red-emitting sulforhodamine B.

Adding a lissamine to a Morpholino increases its delivery efficiency with Endo-Porter, but adding lissamine to a Morpholino can decrease its aqueous solubility.

When a primary amine is attached to the 3 end of the oligo, this converts the 3 -secondary amine of the morpholine ring to a tertiary amine as a consequence of the attachment of a short spacer tethering the new primary amine. When a primary amine is attached to the 5 end of the oligo, the 3 -secondary amine is acetylated so that a reagent added to react with the primary amine will not react with the 3 end of the oligo.

Similarly, filter sterilization may cause Morpholino solutions to lose some activity as some oligo binds to the filter. When put through the same procedures with the same exposure to plastic surfaces, high-concentration Morpholino solutions have a smaller fractional decrease in concentration than low-concentration Morpholino solutions. Therefore, if exposure to plastic surfaces is required, it is best to do the procedures with Morpholinos in a relatively concentrated state (>1 \u03bcM). Similarly, if Morpholinos are to be stored in solution for more than a few days, it is best to store them at high concentration. Since solutions of Morpholinos at very low concentrations (<1 \u03bcM) may lose activity over a time scale of minutes to hours, dilutions should be made just before use. If Morpholino solutions of less than \u223c100 \u03bcM are filtered, the concentration may be affected appreciably given the large surface area of filters.

For a translationinhibiting oligo, this means that even if translation of a protein is immediately and completely halted on Morpholino delivery, an assay for protein concentration will not immediately reveal a successful knockdown. A considerable fraction of the population of the existing protein molecules must be degraded before the knockdown will be evident on an immunoblot. Similarly, although a splice-inhibiting oligo may cause a rapid change in the mass of an RT-PCR product, the protein produced prior to splice inhibition will persist in the cell until degraded.Delivery systems using endocytotic uptake, such as Endo-Porter or Special Delivery, increase the lag between the start of delivery and the appearance of a knockdown or spliceinhibition signal. An overnight wait is generally sufficient to allow for endocytotic uptake.For embryonic studies, the presence of maternal transcripts in a zygote may delay the loss of protein activity when splice-inhibiting Morpholinos are used. Although a splice inhibitor can modify splicing of pre-mRNA transcribed in the zygote, maternal transcripts are already spliced before the onset of zygotic transcription and will be expressed in their unmodified form. Translation inhibitors can inhibit both maternal and zygotic transcripts, and can thus provide more rapid knockdown of protein activity than splice inhibitors. Often inhibition of translation of maternal and zygotic transcripts produces a more severe phenotype than a splice-inhibiting Morpholino targeting the pre-mRNA of the same transcript.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "After delivery, wait for antisense effects to be measurable"}, {"text": "When translation of a protein is inhibited by a Morpholino, existing protein in the cell persists until broken down.
