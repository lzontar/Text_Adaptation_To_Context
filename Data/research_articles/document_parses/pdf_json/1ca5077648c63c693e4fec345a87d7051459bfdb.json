The current study was carried out to investigate the combined antiviral effect in a model of mouse hepatitis virus Type 2 (MHV-2) infection, in which fulminant hepatitis is developed. MHV-2 was injected intraperitoneally into 4-week-old ICR mice, IFN or the vehicle was administered intramuscularly for 5 days, and the antiviral effect was evaluated based on survival periods, liver histology, serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, and MHV-2 virus titers in the liver tissues. The animals in the group treated with a combination of IFN-a and IFN-g survived for longer periods than the groups treated with IFN-a alone and IFNg alone (IFN-a 10 3 (IU/mouse)/-g 10 3 vs. IFN-a 10 3 , P < 0.005; IFN-a 10 3 /-g 10 3 vs. IFN-g 10 3 , P < 0.001). This is consistent with the lower levels of hepatocellular necrosis and serum ALT and the decreased titers of MHV-2 virus in the liver tissues (48 hr, P < 0.001; 72 hr, P < 0.001). These findings indicate that a combination of IFN-a and IFN-g exhibits a synergistic antiviral effect on MHV-2 infection. The biology of MHV-2 is quite different from that of human hepatitis viruses; however, these results suggest the beneficial combined therapy of IFN-a and IFN-g for the treatment of human viral hepatitis.",

To improve the therapeutic effect on patients with IFN-a-resistant chronic hepatitis C, types of IFN-a [Heathcote et al., 1998; Zeuzem et al., 2000] , administration period [Kasahara et al., 1995] , and administration method Fujiwara et al., 1998 ] have been investigated, and new therapeutic methods such as combination therapy with IFN and ribavirin [Davis et al., 1998; McHutchison et al., 1998] , and viral gene-targeting therapy [Macejak et al., 2000] have been attempted. Sufficient efficacy has not been attained, however, and a new therapeutic method that improves further the efficacy of IFN therapy is needed.",

IFN is classified into Type I IFN (IFN-a, -b, -o) and Type II IFN (IFN-g), and IFN-a consists of many subtypes and molecular forms.

It has been reported that exogenous mIFN-a/b administration prolongs survival in a mouse MHV-2-induced hepatitis model [Kato et al., 1986] . It has been reported also that the administration of rIFN-a/b 24 hr before or simultaneously with MHV inoculation is effective in a chronic hepatitis model induced by MHV-2cc, which is an attenuated virus [Uetsuka et al., 1996] . IFN-g receptor deficient mice have been shown to be infected easily with MHV [Schijns et al., 1996] . Kyuwa et al. [1998a,b] showed that the administration of rIFN-g prolonged the survival of mouse-hepatitis virus strain JHM-infected IFN-g receptor deficient C57BL/6 mice, noting the importance of IFN-g in the elimination of the virus. Zhang et al. [1997] showed in vitro that the antiviral effects of IFN-g on MHV occurred when IFN-g was administered 24 hr before MHV inoculation. Based on this finding, IFN administration was initiated 1 day before MHV-2 inoculation in this study. The survival period was prolonged in a dose-dependent manner in the groups treated with IFN-a alone, and the survival curve was prolonged significantly compared to the control group. In the groups treated with IFN-g alone, a significant prolongation of the survival curve was observed compared to the groups treated with IFN-a alone, although the statistical significance was marginal, confirming the prolongation of life by IFN. Interestingly, the animals in the group treated with a combination of IFN-a and IFN-g survived for longer periods than the groups treated with IFN-a alone and IFN-g alone.

Control mice were injected i.m. with the same colume of vehicle. In IFN-a alone and IFN-a/-g combination, the degree of hepatocellular necrosis was milder than in the control. Fig. 4 .

On the histological examination, the degrees of hepatocellular necrosis were mild in the groups treated with IFN-a alone and IFN-a/-g combination compared to the control group, indicating that the progression of hepatocellular necrosis was inhibited by IFN administration. This finding was consistent with significant decreases of serum ALT levels 2 days after MHV-2 inoculation. The MHV titers were considered to be the major cause of hepatocellular necrosis. In the MHV-2 hepatitis model, the amount of virus is considered to determine the degree of hepatocellular necrosis and survival rate. We investigated whether the MHV-2 virus titer in liver tissue was decreased by the administration of IFN, and it was found that the MHV-2 virus titer decreased significantly at each time point in the group treated with IFN-a/-g combination. Therefore, it was shown that an exogenous administration of IFN-a/-g combination synergistically inhibited viral titer in the liver, which may not have inhibited the progression of hepatocellular necrosis only, but also prolonged survival in a synergistic manner. Liver damage, however, measured as the serum ALT levels, was not reduced synergistically. One reason for this discrepancy is because low titer of MHV-2 can still induce mild hepatocellular necrosis, despite the fact that viral titer in the liver was lowered ten-fold with respect to IFN-a or IFN-g alone.",

            "text": "The interaction mechanism between IFN-a and IFN-g, activation of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) by IFN-g has been shown [Matsumoto et al., 1999] . Levy et al. [1990] reported treatment of HeLa cells with IFN-g; IFN-a then induced increased synthesis of latent ISGF3, which was subsequently activated in response to IFN-a to form levels $10-fold higher than levels detected in cells treated with IFN-a alone, showing a synergistic effect. It was shown that IFN-g induced expression of IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2 mRNA, and treatment with IFN-g followed by the administration of IFN-a, significantly increased the intracellular 2 0 -5 0 OAS activity compared to that after treatment with IFN-a alone [Mizukoshi et al., 1999] . Takaoka et al. [2000] found a new signal cross talk system between IFN-a and IFN-g at the receptor level in caveola membrane domains. In IFNAR1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, activation of Stat1, ISGF3 complex and antiviral activity were decreased, and IFNAR1 was phosphorylated; the amounts of Stat1 and Stat2, which recruit to IFNAR1, were increased by stimulation with IFN-g. They showed that Stat2 was activated via IFNGR2-associated IFNAR1, noting that signal transduction of IFN-g may be made more potent and efficient using the system via the IFN-a/b receptors, and that the synergistic antiviral effect of IFN-a and IFN-g was caused by this system. It is not clear whether the mechanism described above was reflected directly in this study but the synergistic gene expression in-duced by a combination of IFN-a and IFN-g may have potentiated the antiviral effect, suggesting that investigation of the expression levels of ISGF3 and 2 0 -5 0 OAS is necessary.",
