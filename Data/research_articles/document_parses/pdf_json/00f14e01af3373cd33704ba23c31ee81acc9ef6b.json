This study aims to evaluate if tocilizumab, an anti-soluble IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, reduces patients' mortality. Methods: 85 consecutive patients admitted to the Montichiari Hospital (Italy) with COVID-19 related pneumonia and respiratory failure, not needing mechanical ventilation, were included if satisfying at least one among: respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths/min, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation \u2264 93% or PaO2/FiO2<=300 mmHg. Patients admitted before March 13th (n=23) were prescribed the standard therapy (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir) and were considered controls. On March 13th tocilizumab was available and patients admitted thereafter (n=62) received tocilizumab once within 4 days from admission, plus the standard care. Results: Patients receiving tocilizumab showed significantly greater survival rate as compared to control patients (hazard ratio for death, 0.035; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.004 to 0.347; p = 0.004), adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics. Two out of 62 patients of the tocilizumab group and 11 out of 23 in the control group died. 92% and 42.1% of the discharged patients in the tocilizumab and control group respectively, recovered.
