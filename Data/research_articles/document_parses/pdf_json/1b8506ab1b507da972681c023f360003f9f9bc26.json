Also, procedures similar to this (eg, tracheal intubation, ventilation or chest compressions) generate infectious aerosols that can favor the transmission of the virus among those performing CPR maneuvers. In these conditions it is considered crucial to maximize protection with the PPE recommended and have medical staff trained in PPE donning and doffing techniques to avoid possible self-contamination. 16---18 The quick recovery of circulation after defibrillation can avoid the implementation of other more invasive resuscitation maneuvers, thus avoiding the generation of infectious aerosol particles that can favor transmission among the healthcare personnel performing the resuscitation maneuvers. 17 Recommendation #3: in case of cardiac arrest (CA) in patients ventilated in the prone position, start CPR maneuvers modified and adapted to the current situation This is a special situation of which we don't have a lot of medical evidence available. The use of reverse chest compressions in patients who remain in the prone position has been described especially in patients in the surgical setting, 19 but it could be used in patients with COVID-19 who are ventilated in this prone position. For defibrillation purposes under this scenario, the location of the adhesive patches that better favors the vector of depolarization generated by the defibrillator would still the conventional one (right subclavicular/left apical). If this is not possible, the antero-posterior (left precordium/left subscapular location), latero-lateral or left dorsal/left apicolateral location of the self-adhesive patches are feasible alternatives that can facilitate defibrillation maneuvers in these cases. 20 Recommendations on actions \u00abnot to take\u00bb Recommendation #1:do not administer amiodarone together with chloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir due to the existing high-risk of adverse effects",

The QT interval should be monitored in patients on hydroxychloroquine, especially with GFR \u2264 50 mL/min, and concomitant treatment with azithromycin. 29 The dose of IFN-\u24241b should be titrated in cases of chronic kidney disease. Dyselectrolytemia and effective blood volume due to diarrhea secondary to lopinavir/ritonavir should be assessed particularly in patients with AKI.

This percentage goes up to 5.6%-23% in patients with seious disease who end up being admitted to the ICU with COVID-19.

They are especially important in patients with COVID-19 treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NAID) or certain nephrotoxic antimicobials due to possible bacterial coinfections or superinfections. The recommendation here is to avoid starch with resuscitation fluids. Exposure to these agents should be limited, if possible, and weighed against the risk of developing or worsening AKI as long as there are alternative therapies and procedures. 33, 34 Recommendation #3: do not underestimate AKI in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the long-term progression of the disease Data on the long-term recovery of renal function after AKI in the context of a COVID-19 infection are scarce. That is why renal function should be reassessed between 3 and 6 months after discharge.

In this epidemiological context, hospitals may temporarily suspend processes of greater logistical complexity and lower chances of organ use such as donation-oriented intensive care, 38 and donation in uncontrolled asystole 39 with the added problem of the impossibility of performing the timely screening of donors to rule out SARS-CoV-2 cannot be done and living donation considered a scheduled, non-emergent surgery in most of the cases.",

The main biochemical characteristic is hypophosphatemia, but it can occur together with sodium and abnormal fluids balances, thiamine deficit, hypopotassemia, hypomagnesaemia, and with changes in the glucose, protein and fat metabolism. 70, 71 Its prevention requires correcting hydro-electrolytic imbalances, supplementing with vitamins such as thiamine, and starting nutrition with low calory-protein intake increasing it every 72\u221296 hours if hypophosphatemia does not become worse until usual requirements are reached adjusted to disease progression. 70---72 Recommendation #2: estimate the calorie/protein requirements depending on disease progression and consider non-nutritional calories. If 60% is not obtained on the 4th day, start complementary parenteral nutrition (PN) The nutritional needs of the critically ill patient change over time and they should be adjusted based on disease progression despite the work overload in the current pandemic situation. In this type of patients, the main problem will be reaching the calorie and protein needs only through enteral administration, which is why it is necessary to resort to complementary PN if 60% of the requirements are not reached on the 4th day of disease progression. 73 The excessive administration of calories can lead to liver dysfunction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 74 which is why we should take into account non-nutritional calory intakes (glucose, propofol, citrate, etc.) to avoid \u00abnutritrauma\u00bb. 75 Recommendation #3: use fast-acting combined with short-acting insulin therapy (twice a day) to keep blood glucose levels < 180 mg/dL and to avoid blood sugar variability and hypoglycemia as much a possible Stress hyperglycemia is independently associated with mortality in critically ill patients. 76 Blood sugar levels should be kept < 180 mg/dL and, if possible, close to 150 mg/dL startin insulin therapy with blood sugar > 150 mg/dL. It is advisable to avoid both hypoglycemia and blood sugar variability because of the important repercussions it has on the morbimortality of the critically ill patient. 77 The use of slow-acting insulin therapy every 12 h, can help us to manage stress hyperglycemia avoiding hypoglycemia and reducing the need to start insulin perfusion 78 given the shortage of pumps and work overload among the health workers.",

We should also be careful with haloperidol, which is commonly used, because of its pharamacological interactions. 109 In cases of uncontrolled agitation with risk of selfextubation, the early tracheotomy could be an effective strategy.",

The administration of hyperimmune plasma has been used in other viral infections with respiratory distress syndrome and has been able to reduce the mortality rate. 132 However, no quality studies have been conducted with COVID-19 and we should keep in mind the ethical and moral connotations associated with its use and production in humans. The use of immunoglobulins can be associated with severe adverse effects such as anaphylaxis and thrombosis. Therefore, the use of hyperimmune plasma and immunoglobulins should be based on well-designed clinical trials where their efficacy and safety can be assessed rigorously. 133",

The risk of adverse events (AE) due to the transfer of critically ill patients has been associated with different aspects, among them, the patient's clinical severity. Other aspects that elevate the risk of AE are urgency of the transfer, personnel not properly trained, transfer time, indadequate or unchecked material, inad-equate logistics, and lack of communication among the personnel involved. 135, 137, 138 Recommendations on actions \u00abnot to take\u00bb Recommendation #1: faster transfers are not always better regarding organization and execution Emergency transfers have a higher rate of AE that scheduled ones. On the other hand, we should know that working on a mobile means of transportation adds another difficulty. Therefore, despite the urgency and haste, we rather slow down and work in the cabin. 135, 137 Recommendation #2: do not forget patient safety throughout the entire process from the planning itself to the patient's arrival at his destination Transfer of complex patients poses numerous challenges. It is necessary to pay attention to those points where there is a higher risk of adverse events such as availability of the necessary material (batteries, oxygen, perfusions), avoidance of accidental disconnections, suitable transmission of information, etc. 139 Recommendation #3: do not transfer patients without stabilizing them first or without having evaluated his risk of transfer Patients with pneumonia due to COVID-19 can be severely hypoxemic and deteriorate severely during the transfer. The transfer of deeply hypoxemic patients without ECMO cardiorespiratory support to reference centers in this therapy has been associated with mortality, which is why we should maximize precautions in this type of patients, stabilize them in advance, assess their risk, and adjust the means of transportation to every patient. 140---142 ",
