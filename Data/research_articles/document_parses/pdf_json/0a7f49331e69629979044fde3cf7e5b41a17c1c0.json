The impact of the increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country, and the increase in the number of cases and deaths outside the country may vary. To examine this, the study employs bootstrap ARDL cointegration approach from March 8, 2020 to May 24, 2020. According to the bootstrap ARDL results, a long-run equilibrium relationship is confirmed for five out of the 10 models. The long-term coefficients obtained from the ARDL models suggest that an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths outside of the UK and the US has a significant effect on economic policy uncertainty. The US is more affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The UK, on the other hand, is more negatively affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths outside the country than the increase in the number of cases. Moreover, another important finding from the study demonstrates that COVID-19 is a factor of great uncertainty for both countries in the short-term.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic has become the focal point of the world.

By May 25, 2020, although China seems to have overcome COVID-19, the number of cases and deaths continues to increase in countries such as the US, Brazil, the UK and Spain. The Chinese government has managed to prevent the spread of the pandemic by implementing quarantine in Wuhan, and temporarily stopping production activities in most sectors. Similarly, many countries have started to take measures with the same practices. However, the lockdowns and quarantines are not economically sustainable and for this reason the measures have started to be stretched gradually.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The COVID-19 is a multi-faceted global crisis that simultaneously interrupts supply, demand and productivity. It has launched a de-globalization process, forcing countries to close their borders, resulting in the restriction of the flow of capital, goods and services between countries, and shot down of business and production, albeit temporarily (Barua, 2020) . As the number of COVID-19 deaths and cases increases, uncertainty, panic, fear and anxiety continue to spread in countries. A major uncertainty is associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths. In addition, the global economic practices and related policy reactions of the pandemic are also uncertain (Barro et al. 2020) . While some countries can effectively treat reported cases, it is uncertain where, when and how new cases will occur (Mckibbin and Fernando, 2020) , how long COVID-19 will last, whether there will be vaccine against the pandemic, how long will governments maintain current incentives to address COVID-19 induced economic problems, and what the social, economic and political implications of this virus will be in the future. It remains unclear whether the economic recovery or stagnation process will be L-, V or U-shaped in many countries after the virus. The pandemic has triggered many more health, social and economic uncertainty. COVID-19 has a negative impact on many sectors including finance, banking, travel, health, service, transportation and infrastructure. The continuity of production and consumption activities in these sectors has been deteriorated due to the virus. Investors stop their investments and withdraw new investment decisions in countries where the virus creates economic uncertainty. In order to protect the citizens of the countries, the social and economic activities against the countries where the virus spreads rapidly are suspended, albeit for a short time.

The bootstrap ARDL test can be used without knowing the stability properties of the series. However, the critical values considered in this approach are derived by the assumption that the variables are stationary at the level or first difference. If any variable is second difference stationary, the bootstrap ARDL approach cannot be applied. In order to determine if this condition is met, we used conventional Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) (Dickey and Fuller, 1981) and Phillips -Perron (PP) (Phillips and Perron, 1988 ) unit root tests. The results of the unit root tests are given in Table 1 . According to the results shown in Table 1 Table   2 . We used the bootstrap ARDL approach for eight different models. These models were analyzed based on COVID-19 cases and deaths (inside and outside the country). For the bootstrap ARDL models, the optimal lag lengths are selected based on the Schwarz-Bayesian criterion. The results of the bootstrap ARDL test show that there exists a long run relationship between the variables in 5 out of eight models. In the five models, the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected by both F-tests and the t-test. Interestingly, in the UK, both the number of cases and deaths within the country do not affect the EPU. In the US, only COVID-19 deaths that occur within the country do not affect EPU. For both countries, COVID-19 cases and deaths outside the relevant country affect its EPU. At the last stage of the analysis, we estimated the long-and short-term coefficients based on the ARDL model. These coefficients are reported in Table 3 . The five models pass all the diagnostic tests for autocorrelation, stability, non-normality, specification and heteroscedasticity (see Table 1A and Fig. 1A in the Appendix). For the US, both domestic and international COVID-19 cases increase the EPU in the long-term. Moreover, the increasing number of COVID-19 deaths in the country raises uncertainty. The uncertainty-enhancing effect of COVID-19 cases outside of the US is greater than the increase in the number of deaths.

Thus, the significance of the dependent variable and independent variables in the error correction term can be tested separately.

Furthermore, the bootstrap method maintains its strong size and properties even when all variables are I(0)(McNown et al., 2018). This method also eliminates the inconclusive inferences about the existence of cointegration and degenerate cases(Goh et al. 2020), and the requirement of the dependent variable to be I(1).
