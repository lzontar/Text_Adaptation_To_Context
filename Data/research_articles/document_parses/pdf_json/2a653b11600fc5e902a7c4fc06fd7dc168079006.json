She had just returned from Indonesia 4 days before and developed symptoms (fever, dry cough, weakness, and dyspepsia) on returning.

A repeat CXR on the second day of hospitalization showed bilateral lower zone opacities. As a result, she was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and was started on lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg (twice daily). As her condition did not improve, HCQ (400 mg stat dose followed by 200 mg twice daily) was initiated on the fourth day of hospitalization. An electrocardiograph (ECG) on hospital day 4 (before initiation of HCQ) was normal, with a corrected QT interval (QTc) of 397 ms. Repeat ECGs the following day remained normal (QTc 414 ms). The patient's condition deteriorated, requiring intubation and ventilatory support on the fifth day of admission. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Sputum culture isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, both sensitive to meropenem. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was discontinued, and meropenem (1,000 mg three times daily) was initiated. She was also started on inotropic support.

Our patient developed RBBB and critically prolonged QTc (QTc > 500 ms) after 3 days of HCQ at a cumulative dose of 1,400 mg. A systematic review of chronic use of chloroquine and HCQ in rheumatic conditions reported cardiac side effects to be common. Among patients who were treated with HCQ who experienced cardiac toxicity (n = 50, median duration of use 8 years [range 10 days to 30 years], and cumulative dose of 1,235 g [range 1.9 g-4,380 g]), the study reported bundle branch block (26%), atrioventricular block (24%), and firstor second-degree heart block (4%). 6 Other cardiac adverse effects of HCQ included ventricular hypertrophy (32%), ventricular hypokinesia (16%), heart failure (ejection fraction < 40% in 52.9%), and valvular dysfunction (8%), especially with high cumulative doses. 6 Other adverse effects of HCQ include gastrointestinal, ophthalmic, neurological, musculoskeletal, psychiatric, metabolic, and dermatological abnormalities. 7 Patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization are at risk for complications including electrolyte derangements, which are risk factors for QTc prolongation. 8 Our patient had several risk factors for conduction abnormalities: administration of HCQ, lopinavir/ritonavir, and inotropes, and hypocalcemia. Lopinavir/ritonavir is also associated with the prolongation of QTc, but the ECG after starting this medication was normal. Among the electrolytes associated with the prolongation of QTc, only calcium was slightly low. Inotropes were started 2 days (noradrenaline) and one (dopamine) day before the detection of conduction abnormalities. Unfortunately, we did not obtain an ECG on the third day of HCQ therapy. We considered the possibility of myocarditis. The elevated troponin coincided with the period leading up to conduction abnormalities and peaked several days later, before decreasing. A repeat TTE was normal. We did not perform further investigations for myocarditis, as our patient remained stable. It is possible the other factors discussed contributed to the development of conduction abnormalities, but the resolution of ECGs changes after discontinuation of HCQ suggested a causal relationship between HCQ and these abnormalities.",
