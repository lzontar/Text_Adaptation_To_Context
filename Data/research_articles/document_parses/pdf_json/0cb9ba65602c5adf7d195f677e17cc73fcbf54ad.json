The infection was performed via intratracheal inoculation with a nonlethal PR8 viral challenge that was sufficient to cause serious pulmonary damage. Viral replication was detected on bronchial structures at 3 days postinfection (dpi) and peaked at 5 dpi, as indicated by the presence of NS1 viral protein ( Figure 1A ). Virus was also detected in alveolar type II epithelial cells throughout the lungs by coimmunofluorescence staining with surfactant protein C ( Figure 1B ). At day 7, the viral protein expression began to decrease, and it became undetectable at 9 dpi ( Figure 1A) . The viral replication profile during the disease progression was further confirmed by qPCR of viral nucleoprotein RNA from infected lungs ( Figure 1C ). In addition, the expression of interferon-g (IFN-g) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), cytokines critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral infections, peaked at 5 dpi ( Figure 1C ). H&E staining of infected lung sections revealed that bronchial cells were damaged at 5 dpi, corresponding to the peak of viral load ( Figure S1A ). We observed extensive lung tissue damage that was marked by large regions of pulmonary hemorrhage and infiltration of host immune cells at 13 dpi ( Figure S1A ). Inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, infiltrated the alveolar spaces of infected lungs, causing tissue damage and bleeding ( Figure S1B ). Together with damaged tissue debris, the infiltrated cells formed dense cell clusters and filled up the alveolar spaces.

ANGPTL4 mRNA was significantly upregulated at day 5 and remained elevated until 9 dpi. Thereafter, its expression decreased, reaching the basal level by 17 dpi (Figure 1D ). Elevated levels of ANGPTL4 protein, specifically cANGPTL4, were detected in lung tissue homogenates at day 7 and remained elevated until 19 dpi, compared to day 0 controls ( Figure 1E ). We also examined the spatiotemporal expression of cANGPTL4 during influenza infection by immunofluorescence staining ( Figure 1F ). At day 0, cANGPTL4 protein was restricted to tubular structures such as the blood vessels and bronchioles ( Figure 1F ). At 5 and 13 dpi, corresponding to the peaks of ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein respectively, we observed stronger cANGPTL4 staining within the inflamed regions infiltrated by immune cells ( Figure 1F ). To eliminate the possible interference from autofluorescence, we provided technical controls for the staining using isotype immunoglobulin G (IgG) control and Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescence antibody. Both the blood vessels and infiltrated alveolar space showed positive staining with anti-cANGPTL4 mouse monoclonal antibody as the primary antibody and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 as the secondary antibody. In contrast, no staining of the blood vessel and infiltrated alveolar space at the corresponding regions in neighboring slide was observed when control IgG and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 antibody were used ( Figure S1C ). The result confirmed the ANGPTL4 signal was specific. To confirm that the elevated cANGPTL4 expression was not virus-strain specific, we examined its expression in the lungs of mice challenged with a sublethal dose of a mouse-adapted H3N2 strain. H3N2 infection of BALB/c mice exhibited increased levels of cANGPTL4 as well as full-length ANGPTL4. The cANGPTL4 protein peaked at 10 dpi, while the expression of native ANGPTL4 protein remained elevated at 15 dpi during the recovery of lung tissues (Figures S1D and S1E).

HIF1-a has been shown to increase the expression of ANGPTL4 in endothelial cells (Zhu et al., 2012; Grootaert et al., 2012) . To investigate if HIF1-a could be responsible for the expression of ANGPTL4 mRNA, we examined the HIF1-a protein expression profile in our animal model. The peak HIF1-a protein expression was detected at 13 dpi, which did not coincide with the peak mRNA expression of ANGPTL4 ( Figure S2C ), suggesting HIF1-a was unlikely to be a major regulator of ANGPTL4 at the early stages of infection. However, we cannot exclude that HIF1-a may maintain or sustain ANGPTL4 expression at later stages of infection. Interrogation of GEO data sets revealed that STAT3 deficiency in pulmonary alveolar type II epithelial cells was related to lower ANGPTL4 levels (Xu et al., 2007) . Interestingly, viral infection triggered host responses through IFN-g and IL-6 pathways, which activate STAT, and displayed overlapping profiles to the ANGPTL4 mRNA expression pattern ( Figure 1C ). In silico analysis of the promoter of the mouse ANGPTL4 gene also revealed a putative STAT-binding site ( Figure 2C ). Thus, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3) antibody on the ANGPTL4 promoter in uninfected and infected lung tissues. The sequences spanning the STAT-binding site were enriched in the immunoprecipitates obtained from the virus-infected lung tissues compared to uninfected tissues (Figure 2D) . pSTAT3 ChIP experiments followed by re-ChIP with p300, a STAT3 coactivator, further confirmed the existence of direct regulation of ANGPTL4 via a STAT3-mediated mechanism ( Figure 2D ). To further strengthen our in vivo findings, we suppressed endogenous STAT3 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and examined the expression of ANGPTL4 in a human small airway epithelial cell culture exposed to IL-6. We observed a significant increase in ANGPTL4 mRNA in response to an IL-6 challenge, which was abrogated when endogenous STAT3 was knocked down by ON-TARGETPlus siRNA (Figure S2D) .

Furin activity in the BALF started to increase at 5 dpi, coinciding with the peak in virus titer ( Figure 2E ). Importantly, the furin activity profile overlapped significantly with that of cANGPTL4 protein ( Figure 2E ). To strengthen the role of furin in ANGPTL4 cleavage, we performed similar experiments in the presence or absence of a furin inhibitor. Furin inhibitor was added to BALF taken from 11 dpi, a time point when the furin activity was elevated. Recombinant flANGPTL4 protein with FLAG tag at the C terminus was used as exogenous substrate. We detected a reduced cANGPTL4:flANGPTL4 ratio in BALF containing furin inhibitor when compared to BALF alone (Figure S2E) , confirming that furin was a major contributor of posttranslational cleavage of flANGPTL4 in our animal model. Taken together, our data demonstrated that ANGPTL4 mRNA was upregulated via a STAT3-dependent pathway during influenza pneumonia.

Mice were injected intravenously with IRDye 800CW PEG contrast agent (50 nmol/kg body weight) 24 hr after the last mAb injection.

The slides were mounted with anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) and then scanned by high-resolution MIRAX MIDI system or Observer Z1 fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss). Technical controls were performed using sections from the same tissue stained with either the target primary antibody (i.e. anti-cANGPTL4 antibody) or mouse control IgG, followed by secondary detection with either Alexa 647 or Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) conjugated secondary antibody. Sections were counterstained with DAPI and mounted. After imaging, the same sections were washed with PBS and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for imaging again to reveal the corresponding tissue morphology.Quantitative real-time RT-PCR.

BALF was kept at -80 \u00baC before use. Furin activity was measured using BALF incubated together with fluorogenic furin convertase substrate for 5 hours at 37 \u00baC (Enza Life Sciences, ALX-260-040-M005) (Cork et al., 2012) . For furin inhibitor assay, BALF from 11 dpi was used to evaluate the capability for cleavage of flANGPTL4 protein. Recombinant C-terminal FLAG-tagged flANGPTL4 (MyBioSource, MBS636187) was added to BALF treated with or without furin inhibitor (Calbiochem, 344930) and incubated at 37 \u00baC for 12 h. Post-translational cleavage of flANGPTL4 to cANGPTL4 was analysed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody.Cytokine concentrations were measured from BALF using Bio-Plex Pro\u2122 Mouse Cytokine 23plex Assay (Bio-Rad, M60-009RDPD) following manufacturer's instructions.ChIP and Re-ChIP. In vivo ChIP was carried out as previously described, except that antiphospho-STAT3 antibody was used (Chong et al., 2009 ). The putative pSTAT3-binding site in the mouse ANGPTL4 promoter was based on reported STAT-binding sites (Seidel et al., 1995; Ehret et al., 2001) . The primers used for ChIP are shown in the table below.Microarray analysis. Infected mice were treated with either control IgG or anti-cANGPTL4 antibody on 13 to 17 dpi as described above. Lungs were harvested at day 12 (for mice with infection alone), or days 14, 16 and 18 (for infected mice treated with either control IgG or anti-cANGPTL4 antibody). RNA was extracted from the lungs with Trizol following the manufacturer's protocol. Further sample processing of the RNA was carried out using In vitro permeability assay. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) and human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC) were purchased from ATCC and cultured following manufacturer's instructions. After reaching confluence, cells were treated with either recombinant cANGPTL4 protein (6 \u00b5g/mL) or vehicle for 6 h before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS solution. Fixed cells were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS solution and stained with ZO-1 antibody, followed by phalloidin-Alexa 594 (Invitrogen, A12381), anti-rabbit Alexa 488, and finally counterstained with DAPI .Imaging was carried out using Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscopy.Laser capture microdissection (LCM). Samples consisted of infected lungs at three reference time-points, i.e. mock infection (day 0); peak of viral replication (day 5); and peak of edema (day 13). LCM was performed with the PALM Microbeam III (Carl Zeiss) as previously described (Chong et al., 2009; . RNA samples from LCM were isolated using RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Life Technologies) and amplified as cDNA with Full Spectrum Complete Transcriptome RNA Amplification Kit (System Biosciences). qPCR was performed as described above.Suppression by RNA interference (siRNA). HSAEC cells were cultured in 6-well plate and transfected with either STAT3 siRNA (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, L-003544-00-0005) or scramble siRNA (Dharmacon) using DharmaFect 1 as described by manufacturer. After 48 h, cells were treated with either recombinant IL6 (20 ng/mL) or vehicle for 12 h before harvesting for RNA and protein analysis.Lung Damage Scoring. The extent of lung damage from H&E stained lung sections was scored by a trained histophatologist (J.E. Seet, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore) in a double-blinded fashion using scoring criteria as previously described (Matute-Bello et al., 2001) . Percentage of significant lung damage, alveolar haemorrhage, alveolar infiltrates, fibrin and alveolar septal congestion were examined. With the whole lung considered as 100%, percentages of significantly damaged lung regions were defined to meet at least 2 criteria of alveolar haemorrhage, alveolar infiltrates, fibrin and alveolar septal congestion.Microarray data processing. To obtain mRNA expression data, the raw data (.CEL) were processed using the Affy package and mogene10stv1cdf / mogene10sttranscriptcluster.db libraries in Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org, with R 3.0.2). All gene level annotation data (such as gene IDs, chromosomal location, Gene Ontology membership) were mapped using the bioconductor utilities. This process generated intensity measurement for 34,760 transcript clusters (probesets) at all four time-points in both control and infected samples. Since some transcript clusters mapped to the same genes, intensity data were averaged for a unique gene ID (Entrez ID), resulting in a processed dataset with 8 samples and 20,694 genes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 180, "text": "3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 384, "end": 403, "text": "(Cork et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1107, "text": "(Chong et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1236, "text": "(Seidel et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1237, "end": 1256, "text": "Ehret et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2686, "end": 2706, "text": "(Chong et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3625, "end": 3652, "text": "(Matute-Bello et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) Analysis for Furin Activity and Cytokines."}, {"text": "To identify differentially expressed genes during the time course between infected and uninfected cells, the ratios of intensities between the two conditions were calculated at each time-point for each of the 20,694 genes. Statistical significance was then calculated in the form of the posterior probability of differential expression given the ratio. To do this, the distribution of intensities and their ratios were examined visually, and it was observed that the data for day 16 was significantly different from the other three days in both conditions. Hence, the data for day 16 was removed for subsequent analysis. To compute the statistical significance of differential expression, the distribution of intensity ratios for all genes were modeled as a mixture of three distributions, each component representing those genes underexpressed in infected cells, equal expression in both cells, and overexpressed in infected cells, respectively: .Using the estimated mixture model f(r), the posterior probability of differential expression (either under-or over-expression) can be computed using Bayes rule. For a gene with ratio r, the probability of upregulation is computed as \u2044 , and likewise for downregulation (probability of downregulation was assigned a negative sign in the reported Table S2 . All the slides were processed together under the same conditions for both anti-cANGPTL4 and H&E staining.Images were taken within the regions identified by the pathologist to ensure the findings reflected representative patterns in pneumonia and normal lung regions.
