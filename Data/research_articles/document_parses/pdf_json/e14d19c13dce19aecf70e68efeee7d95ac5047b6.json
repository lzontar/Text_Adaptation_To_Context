To address these uncertainties, we evaluated the persistence of Ebola virus spiked in sterilized domestic sewage. The viral titer decreased approximately 99% within the first test day from an initial viral titer of 10 6 TCID 50 mL \u22121 ; however, it could not be determined if this initial rapid decrease was due to aggregation or inactivation of the viral particles. The subsequent viral titer decrease was less rapid, and infectious Ebola virus particles persisted for all 8 days of the test. The inactivation constant (k) was determined to be \u22121.08 (2.1 days for a 90% viral titer decrease). Due to experimental conditions, we believe these results to be an upper bound for Ebola virus persistence in wastewater. Wastewater composition is inherently heterogeneous; subsequently, we caution that interpretation of these results should be made within a holistic assessment, including the effects of wastewater composition, dilution, and potential exposure routes within wastewater infrastructure.

The median infectious dose is believed to be <10 infectious viral particles. 11 Once infected, individuals may produce up to 9 L of liquid waste per day, 12 primarily watery diarrhea. 13 Ebola virus is considered a potential bioterrorism agent. 17, 18 In response to the EVD epidemic, both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised direct disposal of Ebola-contaminated liquid waste into sewage systems (wastewater collection and treatment systems) and latrines without disinfection. 14 Initial recommendations were made on the basis of an expected limited persistence of Ebola virus in the environment, as Ebola virus is an enveloped virus, and a lack of strong evidence for a waterborne transmission route. As stated by a WHO guidance document, \"Ebola virus is likely to inactivate significantly faster in the environment than enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission (e.g., norovirus, hepatitis A virus)\". 14 However, as has been noted in a recent review, the persistence of enveloped viruses in the water environment varies by >2 orders of magnitude. 15 Recommendations for Ebola virus-contaminated wastewater disposal were met with debate (e.g., refs 16\u221218) because of uncertainty about Ebola virus persistence within wastewater matrices and the lack of a risk-based analysis for waste handling. Wastewater handling recommendations have since been revised to recognize uncertainty in this area and to recommend disinfection of latrines and holding of wastewater prior to handling to allow Ebola virus inactivation. 19\u221221 Additionally, some facilities have opted to provide additional disinfection prior to disposal of liquid waste into sewer systems. 12 Recent research found both ethanol and hypochlorite to be effective disinfectants for Ebola virus dried on surfaces; 22 however, the disinfection kinetics of Ebola virus within liquid matrices remains unknown. Various wastewater disinfection approaches have been recently suggested for pathogen control in an outbreak setting. 23 Currently, no data on Ebola virus persistence in wastewater exist, hindering risk estimation and examination of potential environmental exposure routes. The necessity of evaluating Ebola virus persistence in wastewater matrices has previously been highlighted, as wastewater in Ebola virus outbreak settings may be temporarily held in open containers or disposed of in open sewers. 24 Historically, the transmission of Ebola virus via environmental routes (droplets, aerosols, or fomites) has been thought to be unlikely due to epidemiological evidence and environmental sampling. 24 The primary Ebola virus transmission route is via direct contact with bodily fluids. 24 Transmission has previously occurred without known direct contact with infected individuals, 25 providing supporting evidence that Ebola virus transmission may be possible via large droplets. 24 The potential for transmission of Ebola virus via wastewater is currently unknown.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 166, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 295, "end": 297, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 298, "end": 299, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 385, "end": 387, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 388, "end": 389, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 453, "end": 454, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 564, "end": 567, "text": "7\u22129", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 725, "end": 727, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 884, "end": 886, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 961, "end": 963, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 991, "end": 993, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1055, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1058, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1351, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2026, "end": 2037, "text": "refs 16\u221218)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2395, "end": 2400, "text": "19\u221221", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2531, "end": 2533, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2861, "end": 2863, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3246, "end": 3248, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3445, "end": 3447, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3533, "end": 3535, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3629, "end": 3631, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3728, "end": 3730, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\u25a0 INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "To address uncertainties regarding Ebola virus persistence in wastewater, we have conducted an initial evaluation of Ebola virus persistence within wastewater to address uncertainty and inform ongoing risk assessments.

Stock virus (Ebola virus Guinea Makona-WPGC07, 10 7.3 TCID 50 mL \u22121 ) 26 was handled as described previously. 27 Ebola virus was diluted in wastewater to achieve two separate virus titers (10 6 and 10 2 TCID 50 mL \u22121 ), and both experiments were completed in triplicate. The Ebola virus concentration in sewage has not been previously measured or estimated; thus, two separate concentrations were utilized to cover possible concentration scenarios. TCID 50 is an end point dilution series that is used to determine at what dilution 50% of the infected wells produce cell death. The original infectious titer can be calculated utilizing the Spearman\u2212Karber method. 28 An approximation of focus-forming units (FFUs) can be made from a Poisson distribution utilizing the formula TCID 50 \u00d7 0.69, assuming each FFU is formed from a single virus. Spiked wastewater was then distributed into three labeled vials for each concentration, and samples were taken daily for 8 days. Tests were conducted at 20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity. Next, 100 \u03bcL from each well of the dilution plate was transferred to a 96-well cell culture plate seeded with Vero cells.

In addition to inactivation, viral particle aggregation or adsorption to wastewater particles may play a role in the apparent rapid viral decrease and enhanced viral persistence. In this case, aggregation would have two primary effects. First, aggregated particles would not be detected as multiple infectious units, resulting in an apparent rapid decrease. Second, it has been previously recognized that aggregation increases viral persistence and resistance to inactivation stressors. 29, 30 Organic matter in wastewater has previously been suggested to enhance viral aggregation. 31 Similarly, viral association with particles has been recognized to provide protection from inactivation, 32 including association of viral particles with wastewater solids. 33 Mechanistically, particle association is believed to protect viral particles from inactivation by shielding them from environmental stressors and is dependent on the organism and particle type. 32 Utilizing the current assay, it cannot be determined if the initial rapid decrease in viral titer was due to viral inactivation or aggregation. Aggregation would result in an apparent viral titer decrease as each viral aggregate would function as an infectious unit in the cell culture assay. To address this uncertainty, we plotted two inactivation curves, both including ( Figure 1A ) and excluding the measured time zero point ( Figure 1B) . A linear trendline, as has been previously suggested for viral 34 and Ebola virus 27 persistence, showed a lower fit (R 2 = 0.59 including the time zero time point, and R 2 = 0.67 excluding the time zero time point) than that previously observed for Ebola virus in deionized water (R 2 > 0.91), but a fit better than that previously observed for Ebola virus in human blood (R 2 < 0.29). The inactivation constant (k) was determined to be \u22121.08 when including the time zero time point and \u22120.35 when excluding the time zero time point. On the basis of the model fit, the T 90 (time for 90% inactivation) would be 2.1 days including the time zero time point and 6.6 days excluding the time zero time point. The observed Ebola virus inactivation in wastewater was slower than that observed for deionized water, which required 1.8 days for 90% inactivation at 21\u00b0C. 27 The observed Ebola virus inactivation in wastewater was more rapid than that reported for human blood, which required 20 days for a 90% inactivation, 27 and results are consistent with recent studies that identified viable Ebola virus to persist in infected macaque blood for >8 days. 35 In general, Ebola virus was found to be less persistent in wastewater than model enteric viruses. While the T 90 for Ebola virus in wastewater was found to be <1 day, the T 90 for hepatitis A is greater than 17 days 36 and the T 90 for enteric adenovirus is 33 days; 37 however, the T 90 for poliovirus is 5 days, 38 which is between the observed T 90 values including or excluding the time zero time point. The results demonstrate a more rapid initial viral titer decrease but overall enhanced persistence of Ebola virus in wastewater compared to the proposed enveloped surrogate bacteriophage Phi6. 39 Limitations. This study has two primary limitations that may alter the persistence of Ebola virus compared to what may be observed in the field. First, the tested wastewater was more dilute than would be expected in typical latrine waste. 40, 41 In general, interaction with constituents within the wastewater (e.g., ammonia) would be expected to contribute to more rapid inactivation of viruses; 42 however, the true effect of these constituents on Ebola virus persistence is unknown. Second, the wastewater was frozen to minimize compositional changes and disinfected (\u03b3-irradiation) prior to utilization to limit microbial activity resulting in false positive viral cell culture. Microbial activity within wastewater matrices would be expected to contribute to more rapid inactivation of infectious viral particles; 36, 42 however, the true effect of microbial activity on Ebola virus persistence is unknown. Microbial activity reduces viral persistence through both the production of metabolites detrimental to viral persistence and direct usage of the viral particles as a nutrient source. 42 Additionally, the influence of other environmental characteristics (e.g., temperature, pH, and mixing) on Ebola virus persistence is unknown and may contribute to altered environmental behavior. As such, we believe these results to be an upper bound for Ebola virus persistence in wastewater matrices. Subsequently, we caution extrapolation of these results without a holistic assessment of all factors, including wastewater composition, dilution, and potential exposure routes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 589, "end": 592, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 593, "end": 595, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 685, "end": 687, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 793, "end": 795, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 861, "end": 863, "text": "33", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1060, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1571, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1588, "end": 1590, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2368, "end": 2370, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2521, "end": 2523, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2656, "end": 2658, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2973, "end": 2975, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3260, "end": 3262, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3502, "end": 3505, "text": "40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3506, "end": 3508, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 4082, "end": 4085, "text": "36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4086, "end": 4088, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 4358, "end": 4360, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1436, "end": 1445, "text": "Figure 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1493, "end": 1503, "text": "Figure 1B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "\u25a0 METHODS"}, {"text": "Implications.

The WHO updated guidelines in January 2015 to recommend holding of latrine waste for 1 week prior to further handling or transport. 20 The objective of this holding period is to allow Ebola virus die-off. On the basis of these results, it would be reasonable to approximate a three-log (i.e., 99.9%) removal of Ebola virus due to this holding period. The resulting risk would ultimately depend upon the initial Ebola virus concentration in wastewater, potential for exposure, and susceptibility to infection via wastewater exposure. The wastewater travel times for wastewater via a sewer system to a centralized sewage treatment works would typically be <1 day, depending on system dynamics. 34 Further assessment is necessary to determine Ebola inactivation and dilution within this period and potential human exposure routes, including workers within the sewer system and Ebola virus persistence within wastewater sludges.
