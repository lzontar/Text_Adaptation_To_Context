In this paper, we share our experiences regarding this co-evolution of open and closed source from the viewpoints of tools, practices, and organizing the development work, concluding that today's bazaars and cathedrals have much more common characteristics than those that separate them.",

To support voluntary cooperation across the Globe, various tools were introduced, including source control management tools such as Subversion and later Git. Distributed version control systems have enabled the development through pulling code from repositories to create software locally as a combination of several code sources. The range of components from operating and windowing systems to tiny, almost self-evident snippets have made open source systems an integral part of systems [22] , many of which we do not consider as open source, and these are also visible in software architecture of many systems [23] .",

New tools are continuously introduced into the market, with the goal of supporting the developed product and the development process [24] . Since these tools have largely been about 'scratching one's own itch', the developers working on proprietary software have quickly realized that these tools really empower the developers.

Naturally, as the company seats most of the maintainer spots, it has a wide influence on what gets in to the main branch of the project and what does not. Typically, the funder has its own interests, although based on contributions also other stakeholders' interests can be identified -for instance, with respect to the Qt framework and open source Qt Project, one can clearly see from the contribution timeline when eg. different phone vendors have had their time in adopting the GUI framework to their own platform-specific needs.",

Recently Microsoft purchased the largest host of code repositories GitHub (https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoftcompletes-github-acquisition/).

On the other hand, communities that originate from business needs move to the opposite direction and adopt in part the bazaar model to get contributions from a wider contributor community. Similarly, the distribution of contributors in open source has turned towards corporate employed contributors instead of a buzzing group of volunteers, and in some of the open source projects, it is not possible for a volunteer to contribute any more [30] -you can fork individually but not join back as the company managing the software does not embrace contributions from other stakeholders, no matter how good they are.

These are modern bazaars where \"capitalism of code\" really rules -the most well-received modules/add-ons thrive and get additional contributors (if allowed), whereas individual hobbyist experiments can still co-exist but will eventually perish. Another example of this is the Microsoft VSCode (https://code.visualstudio. com/) where the actual open source project is the core platform, but the idea is actually not about the OS project (of developing a dull code editor) but about the very inclusive ecosystem where everyone can have a shot at creating an add-on. So, forget cathedral-like strict rules and CLAs (contribution license agreements) and bully-like maintainers, but just create your own \"app\" to the \"store\" and let's have the markets decide what will work.",
