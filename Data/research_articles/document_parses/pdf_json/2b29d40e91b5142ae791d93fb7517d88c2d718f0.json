These broad evidence-based measures have been effective in helping to slow, and ultimately halt, the spread of infectious diseases such as SARS in the past (Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2020) , and have helped attenuate the spread of COVID-19 (Anderson, Heesterbeek, Klinkenberg, & Hollingsworth, 2020) .

Such models necessarily simplify human interaction. For instance, they assume that contact between individuals is random (called homogeneous mixing), such that transmission is just as likely between *Correspondence should be addressed to Tegan Cruwys, Research School of Psychology, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia (email: tegan.cruwys@anu.edu.au). two strangers as between a husband and a wife (Keeling, 2005) . There is also no consensus about the degree to which such models can accurately capture preventative behaviour (e.g., physical distancing; Mao & Yang, 2012) . Criticism of these approaches led to the development of alternatives that are network-based and assume interaction between fewer actors. Interestingly, these network-based models show more diverse patterns of epidemic spread. For instance, in more clustered networks, there is a faster drop-off in the initial transmission rate but a longer persistence of susceptible individuals in the population (Keeling, 2005) . Nevertheless, network models are limited by the degree to which they accurately reflect key features of real social networks (Aparicio & Pascual, 2007) .",

We build on this fundamental proposition by outliningand providing evidence that speaks toa social identity model of health risk taking, in which we specify some of the key processes through which social identities shape health risk behaviours (see also Cruwys, Greenaway et al., 2020) .

Loersch and Bartholow (2011) found that participants perceived beer consumption to be less dangerous when they were presented with beer cans that featured the colours of their university, rather than standard beer cans. Regarding risk behaviour, in a sample of 128 military and police officers, Firing and Ladberg (2012) found that shared identity with fellow officers significantly predicted the likelihood of participants taking the risk of jumping into a freezing ocean. Indeed, shared identity was a stronger predictor of risk taking than the personal characteristics of the participants.",

(2020) found consistent evidence for a direct causal link between shared group membership and risk perception and behaviour, including in the context of disease. For instance, in an experiment utilizing the minimal group paradigm (i.e., with groups created at random based on arbitrary criteria), a confederate ostensibly had a cold, and left used tissues in a shared workspace. Participants rated the health risk as greater when the confederate was an outgroup member compared to when they were an ingroup member. Another study explored health risk behaviour among 149 attendees at a controversial art festival. People who strongly identified with fellow attendees stayed for longer at a performance that posed a potential health risk (because it involved dismembering an animal carcass in close proximity to attendees; see Figure 2 ). In a further experiment, participants were asked to imagine shaking hands with a colleague and later noticing the colleague had a rash on their hand. Participants perceived this to be less risky when their colleague was a member of their political party, rather than an opposing political party. There was evidence that these effects were not attributable to other plausible mechanisms, such as a generalized bias towards ingroup members (i.e., ingroup favouritism). Ingroup favouritism did not mediate the effect of shared group membership on risk perception, and this relationship remained significant when ingroup favouritism was included as a covariate.",

The link between trust and health-related risk taking is supported by evidence from diverse contexts. For instance, ethnographic studies on needle sharing indicate that this behaviour primarily occurs within close social networks and represents an expression of trust (Feldman & Biernacki, 1988) . Similarly, research in interpersonal contexts has found trust in one's sexual partner to be negatively associated with condom use (e.g., see Brady, Tschann, Ellen, & Flores, 2009 ; see also Flood, 2003) . Applied to infectious disease, the capacity for trust to attenuate risk perception and risk avoidant behaviour has implications for contagion spread, because it may lead people to engage in behaviours they should avoid (e.g., shaking hands).",

A more fine-grained analysis suggests that a specific form of trust drives this effect. In two further studies in the context of health and financial risk taking, integritybased trust consistently mediated the effect of shared group membership on risk perception and behaviour (Cruwys, Greenaway et al., 2020) . This suggests that people tend to believe ingroup members pose less risk than outgroup members primarily because they assume ingroup members will behave in principled ways. In the context of COVID-19, this means that people may be more likely to assume that ingroup members are strictly adhering to good hygiene practices and are thus less likely to be carrying the disease.",

            "text": "First, we propose that modelling of disease spread should weight interactions such that ingroup members both (a) interact more often and (b) have a higher risk of transmission with each interaction. Although it may not be practical to model the psychological perception of shared group membership in such models, network models typically include close contacts, which are an acceptable proxy for these purposes. Second, we propose that the elevated risk posed by ingroup members should be recognized in public health messaging, such that this explicitly highlights the risks associated with being in physical contact with others that we care the most about, and the need to be equally vigilant in the way we interact with these people as we are with strangers. Along these lines, we recognize that most people will find it easier to grasp the risk posed by a handshake with a stranger than by a hug with a relative. Thus, third and finally, we propose that public health messages should explicitly challenge this, and frame a lack of physical contact as an expression of care (i.e., show solidarity with your loved ones by keeping your distance).",

Indeed, we note that several group processes that are beyond the scope of this article (e.g., normative influence, leadership, and strategies for building solidarity) have a critical role to play in optimizing the COVID-19 response. While people may find it difficult to perceive the risk of COVID-19 arising from those closest to them, they are also most motivated to protect their loved ones. Indeed, research indicates that if people perceive that failing to modify their behaviour will result in harm for others, or that modifying their behaviours may improve the health of others, then this positively influences their decisions to engage in protective behaviours such as vaccinations (e.g., see Christini, Shutt, & Byers, 2007) . Initial investigations in the context of COVID-19 support the idea that messages focusing on collective responsibility to loved ones increases compliance with public health directives (Everett, Colombatto, Chituc, Brady, & Crockett, 2020; Jordan, Yoeli, & Rand, 2020) .",

Because of this, our evaluation of risk versus safety is inextricably tied to our group memberships. These processes are not, of course, limited to COVID-19. Indeed, prior research has suggested that our perceptions of, and engagement in, many kinds of risk (financial, physical safety) are also structured by shared group membership (Blois & Ryan, 2013; Cruwys, Greenaway et al., 2020) . However, in the absence of biomedical solutions to COVID-19 (e.g., vaccines), it is vital that we harness all the tools at our disposal in the fight against its deadly spread. We argue that applying our understanding of the social determinants of health risk perception and health risk behaviour is one such tool. Statistical modelling of virus spread should weight ingroup members (or close contacts, as a proxy) as posing greater risk for transmission.",
