The study population consisted of 196 children hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia diagnosed between 1993-1995. Seventeen infective agents (10 viruses and 7 bacteria) were sought. Chest radiographs were taken on admission and 3-7 weeks later. All children were treated with antibiotics. Data on the course of illness over the following 8-10 years were obtained from patient files and questionnaires sent to parents. A potential causative agent was found in 165 (84%) of 196 cases. On follow-up chest radiographs, residual or new changes were seen in 30% of cases. The residual changes tended to be more common after mixed viral-bacterial infection (43%) than after sole viral (25%) or sole bacterial (20%) infection. Interstitial infiltrates (66%), atelectasis (46%), and enlarged lymph nodes were the most common sequelae seen on follow-up. Residual findings on follow-up radiographs did not affect the treatment of the children. No further chest radiographs were taken. During the 8-10-year follow-up of 194 children, no illnesses appeared that were associated with previous pneumonia. Twenty-six children had a new episode of pneumonia, 7 of them had asthma, and 6 had different underlying illnesses.

Its incidence is 36-40 episodes/1,000 children/year in those <5 years of age. 1, 2 Many organisms may cause childhood community-acquired pneumonia. Recent observations suggest that 25% of patients have a viral infection alone, 25% have a bacterial infection alone, 25% have a mixed viral-bacterial infection, and 25% have an etiology that cannot be defined. Streptococcus pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are the most common causative agents. [3] [4] [5] The clinical diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult, because the symptoms of illness are often nonspecific: fever, cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, and malaise/lethargy. 6, 7 The clinical signs (decreased breath sounds, tachypnea, and crackles) are sensitive but low in specificity. 7 Thus the presentation of pneumonia in children can be very nonspecific, and a high index of suspicion is required. Chest radiography is suggested as a tool for the confirmation of clinical suspicion or for ruling out pneumonia. 1, 2, 7, 8 Children usually recover from community-acquired pneumonia rapidly and without sequelae. 9 The role of follow-up chest radiographs is not clear.

In their prospective investigation, Grossman et al. 11 studied 129 children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia, and 70 of them had a repeat chest radiograph 3-4 weeks after the initial diagnosis. Only two of the obtained blood cultures showed significant pathogens. No further etiologic investigations were carried out. Of the patients, 14 (20%) did not have complete radiologic resolution. Nine of these patients had a second follow-up between 6 weeks and 3 months later, all of them showing complete radiologic resolution. Gibson et al. 12 studied 77 consecutive pneumonias. Nine of them showed microbiological evidence of etiology, but no detailed information was given. The investigators reported residual pulmonary infiltrates in 16 (22%) of the repeat chest radiographs of 72 children returning for a follow-up visit 3-4 weeks after discharge. Of these 16 patients, 8 had complete clinical resolution, and they had only minor resolving radiologic changes. Seven of the 8 children with symptoms or signs at follow-up showed an improved appearance, and only one remained unchanged. In the study by Heaton and Arthur 13 of 65 children with pneumonia, a nasopharyngeal aspirate was positive for respiratory syncytial virus in 10 children. No other information on the etiology of pneumonia was given. Of 41 patients with follow-up chest radiographs, 31 had a follow-up visit between 4-6 weeks, 5 at less than 4 weeks, and 5 more than 6 weeks after discharge. The follow-up chest radiograph was normal in 36 (88%) children, 4 showed residual shadowing, and 1 had an unchanged appearance. The conclusion of these three studies on 182 patients with community-acquired pneumonia was that a follow-up chest radiography is not necessary if symptoms and signs are absent. If a follow-up chest radiograph is indicated, it should be put off till at least 4 weeks after discharge. [11] [12] [13] Our study differs from previous studies in several important respects. We included patients during 3 years to be able to have a higher number of patients and all major causative agents. The etiology of pneumonia was detected in 84% of cases. This permitted a comparison between bacterial and viral infections.

The duration of fever after onset of antibiotic treatment was reported to be longer in mixed viral-bacterial pneumonia than in viral and bacterial pneumonia. 9 Mixed viral-bacterial infections are probably more common than previously recognized, and may induce a more severe inflammatory process in pneumonia than sole viral or sole bacterial infection. 14, 15 Several studies suggest that the relative frequency of empyema as a complication of pneumonia in children is increasing. [16] [17] [18] In the first study of Tan et al. 19 during 1993-1996, 13.8% of hospitalized children had empyema, and in their second study 17 during 1993-2000, 36% of patients had a complicated pneumonia. Empyema may not be seen on the first chest radiograph. Slow response to antibiotic treatment is an indication for a repeat radiograph. Children with empyema are usually >3 years of age, with a history of !7 days of fever. They often have antibiotic treatment before diagnosis, and have immature polymorphonuclear leukocytes in peripheral blood and high CRP levels. [15] [16] [17] Only one of our patients developed empyema. However, during the following 8 years, 25 cases of empyema were diagnosed at our center (R. Virkki, unpublished findings). It is of interest that every tenth child without a chronic underlying illness had a second episode of communityacquired pneumonia. Only one child had at least two recurrent episodes of pneumonia.
