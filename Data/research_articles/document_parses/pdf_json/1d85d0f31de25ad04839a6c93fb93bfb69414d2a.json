Our assay can be performed with minimal or no lab infrastructure, and is readily adaptable to detect other viruses.

            "text": "molecular biology of ZIKV, there is still a lack of antiviral drugs and vaccines, making robust detection of ZIKV vital to controlling the spread of the disease and implementing early treatments. 25 Our strategy for detecting the presence of viral RNA is based on using DNA nanoswitches that have been designed to undergo a conformational change (from linear to looped) upon binding a target viral RNA sequence (Fig. 1a) . The presence of the viral RNA would be indicated by shifted migration of the looped nanoswitch by gel electrophoresis. Importantly, the system is designed to use common nucleic acid staining of the nanoswitch itself that can intercalate thousands of dye molecules to provide an inherently strong signal. Previously, we demonstrated sensitive and specific detection of DNA oligonucleotides 26 and microRNAs (~22 nucleotides long) 27 using this approach. Applied here to viral RNA detection, we solved the challenges of detecting a long viral RNA (>10,000 nucleotides), improving the signal for long RNAs with a new signal multiplication strategy, and developing workflows for measuring viral loads in biological and mock clinical samples. We showed how multiplexing can be used to detect multiple viruses simultaneously from a single sample and demonstrated high specificity even between closelyrelated strains of Zika. In addition, as a quick response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed DNA nanoswitches in two days (Fig. 1b) and demonstrated the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human saliva at clinically relevant concentrations. Our approach is non-enzymatic, but can optionally be combined with an isothermal amplification step, allowing use in low resource areas (Fig. 1c) . This work enables direct detection of viral RNA without amplification and paves the way toward a low-cost assay for detection of RNA viruses.",

We made the DNA nanoswitches by hybridizing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligos to linearized single-stranded M13mp18 (M13) genomic DNA in a thermal annealing ramp for 1 hour 24 and purified them by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 29 For our initial detection target, we in vitro transcribed RNA from the pFLZIKV infectious plasmid containing the full length genome of the Cambodia ZIKV isolate (FSS13025) (Fig. S1 ). 30 Previous results have shown robust nanoswitch detection of small DNA and RNA sequences (20-30 nucleotides), but the long viral RNA is expected to have strong secondary structures that may interfere with our detection. 31, 32 To overcome this, we used a chemical fragmentation method to segment the RNA into small pieces that are mostly shorter than 200 nt ( Fig. 2a-b and Fig. S2 ). By incubating with our nanoswitch in an annealing temperature ramp, we showed successful detection of the fragmented viral RNAs by gel electrophoresis, thus validating our approach (Fig. 2c) .",

Once the long viral RNA is fragmented, the number of available target sequences increases dramatically. Since our detection signal is proportional to the number of looped nanoswitches, a nanoswitch mixture for different target sequences within the viral genome is expected to provide an increased signal. To test this, we developed an algorithm for choosing multiple sequence regions in the viral genome that can be targeted by the nanoswitches (Note S1). First, we chose the default target length as 30 nucleotides based on results from screening nanoswitches with different detection arm lengths (Fig.   S3) . Then, the algorithm selectively excluded target sequences that could form stable secondary structures ( Fig. S4) and cross-binding with nanoswitch backbone oligos (Fig. S5) , and enforced GC content and uniqueness of sequences. Based on these criteria, we chose 18 target regions along the entire ZIKV RNA for testing and designed the nanoswitches. To facilitate use of our Matlab-based software, we have built a graphical user interface (Fig. S6) and made it freely available (File S1).",

All nanoswitches performed well with a molar excess of positive DNA controls, although they showed more signal variation with fragmented ZIKV RNA (Fig. S7) . We ranked the nanoswitches from strongest to weakest signal and made a series of equimolar nanoswitch mixtures. Using these mixtures, we validated our inherent signal multiplication strategy using a low concentration pool of equimolar DNA fragments to mimic the fragmented RNA. We observed that our detection signal increased steadily up to around 12 nanoswitches (Fig. 2d-e) , and then plateaued above that value. This plateau was not unexpected considering that the largest mixtures added lower performing nanoswitches that may contribute less to the overall sample. Since there was no significant change in performance between 12 and 18, we continued using the 18 nanoswitches mix for our follow up experiments. High sensitivity is one of the key requirements for viral detection. Clinical levels of ZIKV RNA in body fluids of infected patients are often in the femtomolar range, 7,21,33 making amplification a prerequisite for most detection approaches. Based on our earlier observation that DNA nanoswitches can detect microRNAs (~22 nucleotides) in the sub-picomolar scale 27 without amplification, we wanted to assess the sensitivity of our approach for ZIKV RNA detection. We reacted the DNA nanoswitch mixture with different amounts of fragmented RNA in a 12-hour annealing temperature ramp from 40 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C. The results showed visible detection for ZIKV RNA as low as 12.5 pg (~3.5 attomole) ( Fig. 2f and Fig. S8 ) in a 10 \u00b5l reaction volume. Consistent with Fig. 2e , the approach based on using a nanoswitch mix outperformed the highest performing nanoswitch used as a single agent, which had visible detection to about 50 pg (~14 attomole) (Fig. S9) .",

            "text": "Another key requirement for a clinical viral detection assay is specificity. Since ZIKV and Dengue virus (DENV) have overlapping geographical distributions and clinical symptoms, infection with either virus may result in clinical misdiagnosis. 34 Serological diagnostic assays are known to show antibody crossreactivity between the two viruses, and DENV has some similarity to ZIKV in its envelope protein 12 and genome sequence. 21, 31 To test the specificity of our approach, we designed a similar panel of nanoswitches to detect DENV (Fig. S10) . Using the pooled nanoswitches specific for ZIKV and DENV, we mixed each set with in vitro transcribed RNA from each virus and found perfect specificity, with each assay only detecting its correct target RNA (Fig. 3a) . Using the programmability of the nanoswitch, we further demonstrated a multiplexed system for simultaneous detection of ZIKV and DENV. In this case we modified the DENV responsive nanoswitches to form a smaller loop size (Fig. S11) , causing two distinct detection bands to migrate to different positions in the gel. Specifically, ZIKV RNA-nanoswitch complex migrated slower/higher in the gel, while the complex of DENV RNA and the nanoswitch migrated faster/lower in the gel (Fig. 3b) . Therefore, in a single reaction our nanoswitch showed differential and specific detection of ZIKV and DENV RNA. By programming different loop sizes for different targets, this assay can be expanded for up to five viral targets. 27 In addition to possible misdiagnosis between different viruses, there is an additional challenge in determining the specific strain of a virus. For example, in Latin America four different DENV serotypes are known to be present and co-circulate, where misdiagnosis of the infecting strain can have significant implications for treatment options. 35 Thus being able to accurately identify a circulating strain of virus broadly impacts medical care, surveillance and vector control. 36 ZIKV was first identified in Uganda in 1947 before spreading to Asia and the Americas, and ZIKV strains (classified within African or Asian lineage) share significant sequence homology. 37 To investigate if our assay can distinguish between the Asian and African lineages, we tested our nanoswitches against two ZIKV strains which have an ~89% sequence homology, namely the FSS13025 isolated from Cambodia and the MR766 strain isolated from Uganda. In designing the ZIKV strain-specific nanoswitches, we identified five target regions that each have a 5-6 nucleotide difference ( Fig. 3c and Fig. S12 ). To achieve better discernment of the detection signal, the nanoswitches for the Uganda strain were designed to form a smaller loop-size than those designed for Cambodia. Next, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Huh7) was infected with either the Cambodian or Ugandan ZIKV strain. Infected cells were processed to extract total RNA, which was then fragmented and incubated with nanoswitches to probe for viral RNA from either the ZIKV Cambodia or ZIKV Uganda infected cells. The results showed that our assay was able to discriminate between two strains of the same virus even with high genetic similarities ( Fig. 3d and Fig. S12 ).",

            "text": "Further applying our technique to detect ZIKV RNA in biological samples, we either mock-infected or infected Huh7 cells with the Cambodia ZIKV strain at a multiplicity of infection of 1 and extracted RNA from the ZIKV infected cells at 1-, 2-and 3-days post-infection. 38 The nanoswitch assay detected ZIKV viral RNA from the infected cells but not the mock infected cells (Figs. 4a-b and Fig. S13 ). Our detection result shows that the copies of ZIKV RNA within infected cells steadily increased upon the infection and plateaued at 2-and 3-days post-infection (Fig. 4c) . These data demonstrate that our assay can detect ZIKV RNA in infected cell lines, and in contrast to typical RT-PCR assays without amplification of the viral RNA. Moving toward clinical applications, we aimed to demonstrate detection of relevant levels of ZIKV RNA from biological fluids. ZIKV is present in the serum, urine, and other body fluids of infected patients. 39 The viral loads can vary dramatically between individuals, body fluid, and post infection time, 6, 7 but are frequently in the subfemtomolar to femtomolar range, with ZIKV in human urine reported as high as 220 \u00d7 10 6 copies/ml (365 fM). 33 While our nanoswitch sensitivity for in vitro transcribed viral RNA in buffer approaches clinically relevant concentrations, detection from body fluids is further challenged by varying viral loads and by body fluids that can reduce the performance of the nanoswitches due to physiological conditions and nuclease activity. 26, 40 To overcome these potential difficulties, we investigated two independent solutions: 1) adding a pre-processing step to extract RNA from body fluids such as urine, or 2) adding an isothermal pre-amplification step. In the first approach, we spiked a clinically-relevant amount of in vitro transcribed ZIKV RNA into human urine and processed viral RNA extraction using a commercial RNA extraction kit. We then mixed the extracted RNA with the nanoswitches and demonstrated non-enzymatic, clinical level detection of the RNA at 0.28 pM ( Fig. 5a and Fig. S14 ). In the second approach, we demonstrated that our detection can be coupled with other amplification approaches such as nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA). 41,42 NASBA combines multiple enzymes and primers to achieve RNA amplification in a one-pot isothermal reaction (Fig. S15A) . First, we showed feasibility of the amplification of ZIKV RNA by NASBA in water, followed by nanoswitch detection (Fig. S15) . To mimic clinical samples, we spiked infectious ZIKV particles into either PBS or 10% human urine at clinical-levels (1.49 fM to 0.03 fM). From these samples our assay detected ZIKV RNA in ~5 hours ( Fig. 5b and Fig. S15 ). We went one step further and showed that our assay can be performed using a commercially available bufferless gel cartridge (ThermoFisher E-gel) and imaged on a small and potentially portable gel reader (Fig. S16) . With the help of NASBA amplification, the detection ability of our method has about 10,000-fold increase, from ~350 fM (Fig. 5a) to 0.03 fM (Fig. 5b ) and the detection time was reduced from ~13 hours to ~5 hours.",

The functionality of our DNA nanoswitches is largely enabled by DNA nanotechnology, which has become a well-established field that uses DNA as a functional material to fabricate nanostructures. 44, 45 Biosensing is a particularly promising application of DNA nanotechnology, 46 and reconfigurable DNA devices 47 have been demonstrated for the detection of DNA, 47 RNA, 48, 49 proteins, 50 and pH. 51 However, most designs are complex and require laborious readout with advanced microscopy that reduces their practicality. A few approaches have overcome this practicality hurdle to provide widely useful solutions to problems in biological imaging (e.g. DNA-PAINT in super-resolution microscopy 52 and DNA scaffolds for NMR 53 and cryo-EM 54 ) and biosensing (e.g. detection of lysosomal disorders 55 and mapping cellular endocytic pathways 56 ). Our DNA nanoswitches take a reductionist approach, resulting in assays that are robust and sensitive, yet simple to adapt and do not require multiple steps or expensive equipment.

This is of significance because enzymes can be key drivers of assay cost and complexity due to requirements including cold storage/transportation, special buffers and reagents, and strict operating temperatures. These factors make enzymatic assays difficult for field use or for use in low resource areas without modern lab infrastructure. Despite these challenges, most currently available techniques rely on enzyme triggered amplification. 7, 21, 57 For our assay, we demonstrated compatibility and dramatic signal improvement with an optional enzymatic preamplification step (Fig. 5b-c) . However, we believe that further improvements should enable complete coverage of the clinical range without enzymes.

Our DNA nanoswitches align with the goals of \"frugal science\" movement, where cost and accessibility to new technologies are valued alongside typical performance metrics. 59, 60 Our nanoswitches cost around 1 penny per reaction and can be stored dry at room temperature for at least a month, and could be delivered globally without transportation or biosafety concerns. The assay consists of few steps and can be performed in a matter of hours with limited laboratory needs (Fig. S18) . Our assay uses a readout by gel electrophoresis, which is relatively inexpensive and already part of the workflow in many labs, which is comparatively simpler than many nanotechnology-based assays involving multiple incubation and wash steps. Improvements to the signal readout could potentially help make this approach even more lab independent. Successful detection with a commercially available bufferless gel system (Fig. S16) takes us a step closer to enabling field deployment of our assay, and sample preparation could be aided by other frugal science approaches such as the \"paperfuge\" 61 and low-cost thermal cycler. 62 If purified viral RNA is used in NASBA, the entire detection could be shortened to two hours with a 30 min NASBA step 21 and a 1 hour nanoswitch detection assay. 27 The programmability of our system makes it versatile for a wide variety of viruses including ZIKV, DENV, and SARS-CoV-2 as we have shown. These can be detected with high specificity as we showed for ZIKV and DENV (Fig. 3a-b) and for different strains of ZIKV (Fig. 3c-d) , even in a multiplexed fashion. Here we have focused on single-stranded RNA viruses but assays for other RNA or DNA viruses could likely be developed similarly. The fast construction and purification processes can facilitate rapid production of DNA nanoswitches to detect an emerging viral threat, potentially in as little as 1-2 days from knowledge of the target sequences, limited mostly by oligo synthesis turnaround time (Fig. 1b) . Due to the low cost of the test, our assay could also be useful for monitoring viral progression over time in patients, or for testing potentially infected insects or animals. Therefore, with future optimization towards point-of-care clinical applications in resource-limiting environments, the platform we describe here has a potential to improve accuracy and ease of diagnosis in humans, non-human vectors, and other animals.",

Cells were passaged once every three days and maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Twentyfour hours prior to infection Huh7 cells were seeded into tissue culture plates. The following day, one plate was counted. The other two plates were used for mock-and ZIKV-infection, where cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of one. The original Cambodia and Uganda (MR766) ZIKV stocks were a generous gift from Dr. Brett Lindenbach (Yale School of Medicine). RNA from mock-and ZIKV-infected cells was harvested by removing media from the cells was removed and then washing the cell monolayer washed once with ice-cold PBS. Hereafter, each tissue culture plate was lysed in 1 mL TRIzol (Invitrogen) and total RNA extracted per the manufacturer's instructions.

The primers were chosen from reference 21 . The sample was incubated at 41 \u00b0C for 2 hours in the thermal cycler and followed by heating at 94 \u00b0C for 10 minutes to deactivate all enzymes. Three microliters of the sample were used in the following DNA nanoswitch detection assay in PCR tubes with 10 \u00b5l final volumes. After mixing with the DNA nanoswitch and reaction buffer, the mix was incubated at room temperature for two hours. GelRed (Biotium Inc.) at 1\u00d7concentration was added to the detection samples before loading to the 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was run at room temperature for 45 minutes at 75 volts. For the ZIKV related NASBA experiments, first we spiked the ZIKV infectious particles (started at 1.96 fM of particles) into PBS or human urine. Then samples were diluted into different concentrations 1.49, 0.33, and 0.03 fM with 1xPBS or 10% human urine. Subsequently, blocking oligo (200 nM) was added and the viral RNA was released by heating the samples at 94 \u00b0C for 3 minutes. For the human urine samples, RNase Inhibitor (NEB, Murine) was also added at concentration of 2 U/\u00b5l before heating. After cooling down at room temperature, 0.5 \u00b5l RNase Inhibitor at 40 U/ul (NEB, Murine) was added to 10 \u00b5l human urine sample to protect the viral RNA.
