Table 1 shows baseline demographic information, disease 84 severity and hospital outcomes. Hospitalized participants were significantly older than both 85 symptomatic outpatients and individuals recovered from COVID-19 (Kruskal-Wallis P<0.001). 86 Participants recruited in the outpatient setting had the shortest time between the start of 87 symptoms and the time of sample collection (median 5 days) compared to hospitalized 88 individuals (median 13 days) and recovered participants (median 27 days). 89 We report SARS-CoV-2 viral load analysis both as a continuous variable and analyzed as 90 a categorical variable (detectable versus undetectable) given that only qualitative commercial 91 qPCR testing is available for clinical care. Amongst hospitalized individuals, the majority still 92 had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the time of initial sample collection, including 50% with variable, individuals with detectable plasma, nasopharyngeal or sputum viral loads had 124 significantly lower absolute lymphocyte counts, and higher CRP and IL-6 levels compared to 125 those without detectable plasma viremia (Fig 2b-d) . Plasma, nasopharyngeal and/or 126 oropharyngeal viral loads were also significantly associated with increased levels of the 127 inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IP-10, MCP1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-1RA (Fig 2a) . Compared to individuals who were discharged from the hospital, those who eventually died had 131 significantly higher levels of plasma viremia at the time of initial sampling (median plasma viral 132 load 1.0 vs 2.0 log10 RNA copies/mL, P = 0.009, Fig 3a) , which occurred a median 11 days 133 before death. For hospitalized individuals with initial detectable viremia, 32% died vs 8% of 134 those without initial viremia (OR 5.5, P = 0.02, Fig 3e) . We performed a sensitivity analysis to 135 assess whether plasma viremia may also predict mortality in those with the most severe disease.",

The prevalence 163 of SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia was lower than that found in respiratory secretions, but164 detectable plasma viremia had a clear relationship with concurrent clinical disease severity, 165 lower absolute lymphocyte count, higher levels of inflammation and increased risk of death. There is an intense search for biomarkers of COVID-19 disease progression that could 196 accelerate early-phase clinical studies of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. There has been 197 an expectation that respiratory tract viral shedding could serve as such a surrogate biomarker, but 198 it is unclear if such assumptions are accurate. An example is the reported clinical benefit of 199 remdesivir 33 despite the lack of evidence that remdesivir significantly reduces respiratory tract 200 viral loads 34 . We found only modest correlations between respiratory tract viral loads and those 201 of the plasma. This highlights the need for additional studies to assess whether these anatomic 202 compartments may serve as distinct sites of viral replication and whether antiviral medications 203 might have differential effects on viral respiratory tract shedding versus plasma viremia. 204 Our study has a few notable limitations. First, sputum samples were obtained for only a 205 subset of participants as many participants were unable to generate a sample. While sputum 206 samples had the highest frequency of SARS-CoV-2 detection, this finding demonstrates a 207 potential limitation in their use as a reliable diagnostic modality. Our longitudinal analysis of 208 viral load changes was limited to a subset of participants due to limits on the frequency of blood 209 draws for hospitalized individuals and early discharges in those with relatively mild disease.",

SARS-CoV-2 viral loads below 40 RNA 305 copies/mL were categorized as undetectable and set at 1.0 log10 RNA copies/mL. For the subset 306 of participants with repeated sampling, the sign test was used to assess viral load change between 307 the first and second time point. Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman rank-based 308 testing. In the correlation analysis between the soluble inflammatory markers and viral load, a P-309 value <0.01 between a marker and any of the viral load measurements was the threshold to310    include that marker in the reported results. Logistic regression and other statistical analyses were 311 performed using GraphPad Prism 8 and SAS software, version 9.4.
