Two prompt response teams of KCDC were dispatched to the hospital to scrutinize the etiology of the nosocomial infection. After their initial assessment to block the chain of transmission, the confirmed COVID-19 cases and identified contacts were moved to separated wards of a city-run hospital for the required isolation period of 14 days. As part of the epidemiological procedures, an investigation of the environmental samples was performed to discern a route of transmission of the coronavirus, and infectious risk for dispersal of the pathogen [3]. Environmental contamination and the mode of transmission by other coronaviruses such as the Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is uncertain. Despite this, MERS-CoV RNA was detected", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "cm), which focused on frequently touched surfaces in wards and communal facilities of COVID-19 patients in the hospital. Sterile flexible swabs dipped in viral transport medium (Easy Swab, Komed, SungNam, Korea) were used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA. All environmental samples collected were transported to the laboratory without delay and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted from the viral transport medium using a commercial RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), according to previous methods by Kim et al (2020) [9]. For identifying the presence of SARS-CoV-2, real-time RT-PCR targeting of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and envelope protein gene were used. The primers and probes were as follows: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene detection were: 5'-GTGARATGGTCATGTGTGGCGG-3' ( Fo r wa rd ) , 5 ' -C A R AT GT TA A A SAC AC TAT TAG C ATA -' 3 (Reverse) and 5'-CAGGTGGAACCTCATCAGGAGATGC-3' (Probe in 5-FAM/3'-BHQ format) and the primer and probe sequences used for the envelope protein gene detection were: 5'-ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT-3' (Forward), 5'-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3' (Reverse) and 5'-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-3' (Probe in 5-FAM/3'-BHQ format). A total of 5 mL extracted RNA was reverse transcribed, and amplified by PCR under the following cycle conditions: 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, and 60\u00b0C for 1 minute using an ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) [9]. Cycle threshold refers to the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold in RT-PCR and an interpretation of cycle threshold value means a positive result for under 35 cycles, re-test for 36-37 cycles, and negative for over 38 cycles as the same criteria for human diagnosis. A lower cycle threshold value could reversely interpret a higher viral load on the surface.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": ". These specimens were from frequently-touched surfaces such as telephones, bedrails, chairs, and door handle in wards, and communal facilities where COVID-19 patients stayed. Among them, 68 samples from 6 hospitals (A, B, C, D, E, and G) had negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA results because disinfection and cleaning had been performed by the local health centers before samples were collected. Even the car key of a COVID-19 patient's automobile (#31 case) was determined to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA test. However, among the remaining 12 samples from 2 \"mass facilities\" (F and H) where prior disinfection and cleaning procedures had not occurred, 2 samples collected from door handles in the COVID-19 patient's room in the rehabilitation center (F), were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for both target genes (16.7%, 2/12). Discussion Public health emergencies require a rapid assessment of the current epidemiological situation for prevention and control measures. Since 2015 with the MERS outbreak in South Korea to efficiently tackle the transmission of newly emerging infectious diseases, 10 prompt response teams within the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been in operation. The teams in the event of an outbreak are dispatched to the site of the outbreak as soon as possible, to identify the index case and potential contacts through epidemiological investigations, and isolate the individuals concerned. Based on the field situation and resources available in congregate health settings, \"a cohort isolation of potential contacts\" measure if necessary, is implemented instead of individual-level isolation.Korea has experienced more group-associated outbreaks in congregate health settings than in sporadic occurrences.Recently, a clustered outbreak occurred in Eunpyeong St.Mary's hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea, which instigated the prompt closing of the hospital, and isolation of the contacts to separate wards within the hospital (cohort isolation), and this seemed to have played a role in preventing the nosocomial spread of COVID-19 and spread to the local community[10].
