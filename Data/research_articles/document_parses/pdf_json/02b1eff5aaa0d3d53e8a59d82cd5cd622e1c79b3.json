Recent simulation modelling work by Ghosal (2020) 1 suggests that the duration of lockdown in India is directly proportional to the worsening of glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. The authors suggest that this may be due to limited opportunities to engage in a healthy lifestyle (including exercise) and the reduced accessibility of anti-diabetic medications and medical advice. We agree that the varying lockdown measures may have a direct impact on diabetes management (HbA1c control) as diabetes (particularly for type 2 diabetes) is often managed with lifestyle strategies such as exercise, diet modification, and self-monitoring of blood glucose and not exclusively through anti-diabetic medications 2,3 .",

We posit that with the current isolation and lockdown measures, these incidental activities will be greatly reduced with a corresponding increase in sedentary behaviours. To help with the management of diabetes more purposive forms of physical activity are required 6 . It remains unknown whether this increase is happening among South Asian migrants for whom purposive exercise was perceived to be an inherent part of the Anglo-Australian identity and not fitting with their own ethnic identity 5 .",
