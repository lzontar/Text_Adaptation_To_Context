            "text": "1. The ciliate populations of two temporary ponds in southern Ontario were studied throughout their aquatic phases in 2001. Pond I (1 ha) held water for 98 days, whereas Pond II (0.25 ha) held water for 34 days. Populations were assessed both within the ponds themselves and within a series of enclosures in which invertebrate predator pressure was manipulated. 2. In the natural pond water, total ciliate abundance in Pond II rose rapidly from day 1 increasing two orders of magnitude by day 7. In contrast, total abundance in Pond I began at the same level as in Pond II but increased much more slowly, reached a plateau of around 500 individuals L )1 , and increased again late in the hydroperiod. 3. Despite being only 500 m apart, the two ponds were fairly dissimilar in terms of their species richness and species composition. Pond I contained 50 species compared with 70 species for Pond II, with only 24 species shared. Additional species occurred within the enclosures raising the total species richness to 145 species; 88 from Pond I, 104 from Pond II, with 47 species (30%) in common. Pond II contained more mid-sized ciliates (50-200 lm), whereas Pond I was dominated by smaller ciliates, especially in mid-May and early June. In Pond I, cumulative species richness throughout the hydroperiod was highest in the predator addition enclosures (65 \u00b1 4 species), followed by the partialpredator exclusion enclosures (50 \u00b1 4). Lowest species richness was found in the control enclosures (39 \u00b1 2) and in the pondwater controls (39 \u00b1 0). Differences between the ciliates in the natural pond water and the enclosures appeared to be related to a greater concentration of phytoplankton within the enclosures (perhaps resulting from extensive growth of duckweed, Lemna, outside), and higher densities of zooplankters in the pond. 4. The physicochemical environment influenced species richness, total abundance and the number of rare species (27 in Pond II versus 13 in Pond I). Variation in ciliate abundance in Pond I could be explained by the number of days after filling (39%) and enclosure treatment (23%). These two parameters also explained 72% of the variation in species richness in Pond I (46 and 26%, respectively). Sixty-five per cent of the variation in abundance in Pond II could be explained by the measured parameters: number of days after filling 27%, pH 19% 2 , and nitrate levels 12%. Fifty-two per cent of the variation in species richness was explained by the environmental parameters, of which pH was the most influential. Species succession was a strong feature of both ponds and its relationship to environmental variables and the presence of other organisms is discussed. 5. Addition of invertebrate predators resulted in higher abundance and higher species richness for a limited time period in one of the ponds -suggesting that differences in foodweb dynamics may influence ciliate community composition.",

In marine environments, ciliates have been recognised as an important link between bacteria and pelagic zooplankters in a 'microbial loop' (e.g. Sleigh, 1989; Pierce & Turner, 1992) , and, in Lake Michigan, experimental studies have shown that a large fraction of picoplankton carbon is directly transferred to higher trophic levels via a picoplankton-protoctist-zooplankton coupling (Carrick et al., 1991) . Ciliates are believed not only to route energy through their consumption of primary producers and subsequent ingestion by predaceous and detritivorous metazoans (Sleigh, 1989; Wickham, 1995) , but also as photosynthesizers via phytoflagellate symbionts (Sorokin, 1999) . High rates of growth and reproduction make ciliates major organic matter transformers.",

Six, water-tight, galvanised sheetmetal enclosures, each measuring 2.3 m in diameter and 0.7 m in height, were installed in each pond prior to snowmelt. They were randomly located within relatively homogeneous areas of depth, substrate and exposure, and were forced into the bed to a depth of approximately 10 cm, effectively corralling sections of pond. Within each pond, two of the enclosures were covered with a fine (1 mm), white mesh that excluded the entry of aerially colonising insect predators (primarily Coleoptera and Odonata) -although they may subsequently have contained predators that hatched from dormant eggs laid on the pond bottom in the previous year. Another two enclosures served as 'predator addition' manipulations to which were added, weekly, specimens of the seasonally predominant predators present in the ponds. This amounted to a total of 30 beetle larvae (Rhantus sp., Agabus sp., Acilius sp.) added to each enclosure in Pond I (on days 28, 35 and 42) and 20 in the Pond II enclosures (on days 27 and 34). A total of 120 dragonfly nymphs (Sympetrum obtrusum, S. internum, S. costiferum) was also added to each of the two enclosures in Pond I (on days 49, 56, 63, 70, 77 and 84) . No odonates were added to Pond II as it had dried up by this time. The last two enclosures in each pond served as controls in an attempt to determine any enclosure effects. Thus alongside the samples taken from the ponds themselves, termed 'outside enclosures', samples of water, chlorophyll a and ciliates were also taken from each of the three treatments.",

Over the 34-day hydroperiod of Pond II, roughly twice the number of ciliate species were supported than during the first 34 days of Pond I (Fig. 4b) . However, species richness in Pond I rose to near Pond II levels towards the end of its own hydroperiod (around day 98). Cumulative species richness throughout the hydroperiod was highest in the predator addition enclosures (65 \u00b1 4 species), followed by the partial predator exclusion enclosures (50 \u00b1 4). Lowest species richness was found in the control enclosures (39 \u00b1 2) and in the pond controls (39 \u00b1 0). As these two controls were similar, the differences seen in the others were likely the result of predator manipulation rather than because of enclosure effects. Interestingly, there was some increase in both the predator addition enclosures before the predators were added. After addition, these increases became larger. The results obtained in Pond II were less convincing: predator addition (54 \u00b1 3), partial predator exclusion (50 \u00b1 7), enclosure controls (44 \u00b1 4) and pond controls (50 \u00b1 3). For each pond, seasonal ciliate abundance (logtransformed) and species richness from all treatments and outside the enclosures were combined into a larger data set for analysis of the possible influence of environmental factors. Stepwise linear regression indicated that 69% of ciliate abundance in Pond I could be explained by the measured environmental parameters, with number of days after filling and treatment being the most influential (explaining 39 and 23% of the variation in ciliate abundance, respectively; P < 0.001). These two parameters also explained 72% of the variation in species richness in Pond I (46 and 26%, respectively; P < 0.001). Sixtyfive per cent of the variation in abundance in Pond II could be explained by the measured parameters, with number of days after filling accounting for 27% (P < 0.001), pH 19% (P < 0.001) and nitrate levels 12% (P < 0.001); water depth was excluded from the analysis as it was highly correlated with days after filling (r \u00bc 0.99).

Pond I contained only one, although very abundant, facultative algivore, Pelagohalteria cirrifera. Omnivorous ciliates (known to feed on autotrophs, other protoctists and even on small metazoans; Foissner & Berger, 1996) were moderately important parts (21%) of the communities of both ponds early in the season but thereafter declined in Pond I ( Fig. 6 ; also marked with 'o' in the prey column of Appendices 1 and 2).",

Further, ciliate abundance in permanent waters often shows a bimodal seasonal pattern, with maximum ciliate abundance in spring and autumn co-occurring with thermal mixing (e.g. Goulder, 1971a; M\u00fc ller et al., 1991) . Ciliate abundance increased as the habitat was drying up in both ponds, possibly as a result of warmer water and other 'favourable' physical conditions in late summer (Wang, 1928) . The Vandorf ponds are devoid of any nutrient bursts corresponding to thermal mixing, relying instead on progressive nutrient release from the breakdown of dead aquatic vegetation and riparian leaf litter input from the previous year. Hatano & Watanabe (1981) found that high abundance of bacterivorous protoctists in the leaf litter of a small pond was closely related to litter decomposition in late autumn and spring. Densities of algae were low throughout the season in our ponds, and it is likely that much of the communities in both ponds relied on bacteria for food. Indeed, facultative bacterial feeders were frequently more abundant than facultative algivores. Bacterial counts showed this food source to be three times higher in Pond II, possibly explaining the much higher abundance of ciliates there; although ciliate richness was similar in both ponds.",

Although the upper end of the range of ciliate richness from permanent ponds is comparable (109 species), the lower end is considerably less so (36 species) (Groli\u00e8re & Njine, 1973; Dillon & Bierle, 1980; Hatano & Watanabe, 1981; Kusano et al., 1987; Madoni, 1991; Guhl et al., 1994) .

For example, Pond II is situated in a hayfield with essentially only one type of vegetation (Phalaris sp.), whereas Pond I supports a wide variety of typical wetland plants. In theory, a more heterogeneous habitat should provide a wider range of microhabitats thereby increasing species richness. Species richness in Pond I increased with time in a fashion similar to that noted in permanent freshwater bodies (M\u00fc ller et al., 1991) , but this was not so for Pond II. One cautionary note is that differences between the two ponds may have been affected to some extent by identifications made on live and preserved samples (ponds I and II, respectively).

In Pond I, dominant ciliate taxa alternated or were replaced almost on a weekly basis. Replacement of dominant taxa every 1-4 weeks has been recorded from permanent ponds (Bick, 1973; Kusano et al., 1987) . It is known that the abundance of single ciliate species often fluctuates widely in response to availability of a suitable food resource and competition, or predation (Finlay & Esteban, 1998) , with seasonal events such as detritus formation by litter feeders in spring, leaf fall in autumn and selective predation, resulting in species replacement (Kusano et al., 1987) . Pond II was spatially more homogeneous than Pond I, but temporally more heterogeneous in that each week there was a substantial decrease (10 cm) in depth. The latter, perhaps combined with other changes (such as large changes in conductivity), may have created an unstable environment that reduced competition among its species, allowing survival of a greater diversity.",

A seasonal succession of ciliates was evident in both ponds I and II. Such successions have been previously recorded in the ciliates of permanent fresh waters (Beaver & Crisman, 1989; Carrick & Fahnenstiel, 1990; M\u00fc ller et al., 1991) , and are generally considered to be driven by thermal regimes and food resources (Beaver & Crisman, 1989) . Other studies, of both freshwater and marine ciliates, have added the following factors: light and oxygen regime, water chemistry, presence of metabolites, and the abundance of predators such as copepods, ostracods and rotifers (Fenchel, 1987; Sleigh, 1989; Pierce & Turner, 1992) . Ciliates typically have very short generation times (1-2 days) combined with high reproductive capacities, species substitution therefore can occur rapidly. As habitat conditions change, species appear and disappear in association with a large, local diversity of temporarily rare and encysted species. From this 'pool', new species are able to very quickly fill vacant niches (Finlay & Esteban, 1998) .",

A number of species appeared early (pioneering or early successional species), of which some disappeared quickly (sporadic residents) whereas others persisted for the entire hydroperiod (regular residents; e.g. Spirostomum ambiguum, and species of Urotricha and Uronema). Some species did not appear until the mid-aquatic phase (mid-successional species; e.g. Brachonella spiralis and Obertrumia aurea), and some not until the end of the hydroperiod (late successional species; e.g. Stokesia vernalis, Vorticella aquadulcis and Dileptus bivacuolatus). Further, some species were spatially well-distributed, whereas others were rare (e.g. found in less than two replicates). It should be noted, however, that these patterns were based on only one full year of intensive sampling. The literature indicates that both consistency (especially in Epistylis and Strobilidium) and inconsistency in occurrence pattern can be expected over several years in permanent waters (M\u00fc ller et al., 1991) .",

First, there was more phytoplankton inside the enclosures, as indicated by the chlorophyll a concentrations, and many of the ciliate species recorded were algivores. Although chlorophyll a did not emerge as a significant factor in the stepwise linear regression, Pond I peak in relative abundance of algivorous species corresponded with high chlorophyll a levels between days 42 and 49. Previous studies (see review by Beaver & Crisman, 1989) have found ciliate abundance and biomass to be strongly related to chlorophyll a, and algivorous ciliates in the benthos have been shown to peak in summer when the production rate of benthic algae was high (Stanley, 1972 7 ; Fenchel, 1975) . In Pond I, the water surface outside the enclosures became densely covered by duckweed (Lemna) from the middle of the hydroperiod onwards, thus reducing the light available to photosynthetic organisms. Accordingly, the pond water had lower chlorophyll a concentrations and thus less food for algivorous ciliates. Madoni (1991) has also shown that a dense cover of Lemna reduces this trophic group. We are uncertain why Lemna, although present, did not thrive in the enclosures. Pond II did not support duckweed, and there the treatments and controls were alike, both in terms of ciliate abundance and chlorophyll a concentrations and the proportion of algal-feeding species was higher (44%).",
