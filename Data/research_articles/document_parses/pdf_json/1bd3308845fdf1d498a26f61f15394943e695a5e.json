Resources that caregivers can consume and implement independently are critical in helping them manage behavior in their homes. This article includes antecedent and consequent behavior-management strategies that correspond with provided written instructions and video tutorials designed for caregivers. The materials presented within this article were originally produced and found effective in aiding caregivers managing behavior in their homes within the Alabama foster care system. Although individuals within this system are at a higher risk of abuse and neglect and may engage in higher levels of aberrant behavior, we are distributing this document in hopes it will help behavior analysts working across a variety of populations as they navigate changes in service delivery and adopt resources for continued care and caregiver training.",

The Editor's Note This manuscript is being published on a highly expedited basis, as part of a series of emergency publications designed to help practitioners of applied behavior analysis take immediate action to adjust to and mitigate the COVID-19 crisis. This article was submitted on April 2, 2020, and received final acceptance on April 17, 2020. The journal would like to especially thank Dr. Matthew Brodhead for his expeditious review of the manuscript. It is important to note that general tips for behavior management and parent training are in no way a substitute for functionbased assessment and treatment by a behavior analyst. Nevertheless, we believe the tools contained in this article will be useful to the families we serve, especially in this moment of increased parental demands and stress. The views and strategies suggested by the articles in this series do not represent the positions of the Association for Behavior Analysis International or Springer Nature.",

Meanwhile, multiple states across the United States are reporting stress on child protective services and the foster care system in the wake of this pandemic, the very systems meant to protect children from abuse and neglect (Brindley, 2020; Knowles, 2020; Rae, 2020) .

The primary function of APMRT is to provide behavioral interventions for challenging behavior and reduce the use of unnecessary psychotropic medication with foster youths. Members of APMRT wrote the enclosed materials and supporting statements to inform the intervention recommendations given to foster caregivers and biological caregivers receiving behavioral services and to provide remote information to caregivers still on the wait list for in-person services. In the wake of COVID-19, most of these services are temporarily suspended. Therefore, the purpose of the current article is to disseminate this list of evidence-supported practices, a corresponding written guide on intervention recommendations, and instructional videos describing the interventions (see Appendix) as a resource for caregivers, social workers, or behavior analysts as they transition to remote, at-home service delivery.",

Each category of strategies is linked to a corresponding free-access online video tutorial that provides further explanation and practical examples of each strategy. In addition, each video tutorial includes a comprehension quiz, such that practitioners can assess caregivers' understanding of the material.
