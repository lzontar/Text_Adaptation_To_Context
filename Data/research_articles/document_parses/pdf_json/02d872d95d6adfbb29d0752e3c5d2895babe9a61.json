National healthcare systems are facing the contagion with incredible strength, but concern regarding the psychosocial and economic effects is growing quickly. The PsyCovid Study assessed the influence of psychosocial variables on individual differences from the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the issues of health and economy in the Italian population. Italian volunteers from different regions completed an online anonymous survey. The main outcomes were the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health and the economy. A two-way MANOVA evaluated differences in the main outcomes, with geographical area (northern, central, and southern regions) and professional status (healthcare workers or not) as factors. We then tested the relationship linking psychosocial variables (i.e. perceived distress and social isolation, empathy, and coping style) to the main outcomes through two different mediation models. 1163 responders completed the survey (835 females; mean age: 42 \u00b1 13.5 y.o.; age range: 18-increase people's awareness of the severity of the impact of the Covid-19 emergency on economics.

At the end of December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted of the novel viral illness that caused respiratory symptomatology which sometimes resulted in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1, 2) . The first two cases in Italy, a couple of Chinese tourists, were registered in Rome (3) at the end of January 2020. Later they were proved to be infected prior to their arrival in Italy (4) . Specific algorithms and protocols were then applied, and specialized teams were instituted, in order to control the contagion spread (5) . However, a dramatic increase of positive cases and hospitalizations quickly followed, especially in Northern Italy. After the confirmation of 2019-nCov positivity of the two Chinese tourists admitted at the Spallanzani Hospital in Rome on February 21, 2020, the Italian government declared a state of emergency (6) .

This indicates that a way of facing problems based on active strategies, planning, and focused efforts towards problem resolution makes people more aware of the imminent crisis and gets them prepared to face the economic disaster (e.g. industrial conversion of activities to produce goods currently in high demand). Interestingly, a previous report on the psychosocial impact of global infection outbreaks, including the SARS and the West Nile Virus, showed that the perceived threat of these diseases were related with different coping strategies, also including empathic responding (24) .

Our data teaches us the need to invest in preparedness to prevent, rapidly identify, and contain mid-and long-term consequences of global health emergency outbreaks such as Covid-19. Although reacting with travel bans and quarantines costs effort and economic resources and impacts on the well-being of millions of individuals cordoned off in a zone of contagion, it is reasonably necessary to contain further disasters. The psychological weight of thousands of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases and of huge numbers of deaths is difficult to bear without a known successful scenario. People are suffering from the weight of having a limited access to social or psychological support, as well as from not seeing a future constructive outlook. In this view, big data analyses should analyze public health risks in the future in order to adjust health care strategies that could be implemented for any future crisis.
