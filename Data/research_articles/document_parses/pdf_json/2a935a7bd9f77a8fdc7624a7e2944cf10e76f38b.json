These impairments affect the ability to sense odors in foods and the environment, obviously affecting quality of life, related to social interactions and general well-being. The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology (ENT-UK) considers loss of sense of smell in their list of COVID-19's markers of infection. Here we present two cases in which early manifestations of anosmia and hypogeusia were experienced with psycho-sensorial and atmospheric phenomena. Psychiatrists, neurologists and physicians in general should be aware of this symptom presentation in order to avoid mistreatment, given that persistent olfactory dysfunction might increase the risks of nutritional deficit and lead to development of adjustment disorders. All clinicians should be aware that the presentation of SARS-CoV-2's symptoms goes far beyond respiratory and sensorial dimensions and involves psychosensorial and neurological dimensions; these clinical observations could shed light on the neurobiological substrates involved in COVID-19 disease.",

The evidence is based on the observations from South Korea, China, and Italy, where a considerable percentage of patients who were otherwise asymptomatic, regarding respiratory symptoms, developed anosmia and hyposmia; and hypogeusia was also a common complaint (5, 6% of 214 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients) (Hopkins, 2020) .",

Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare complication of influenza and other viral infections, which occurred in a female patient, diagnosed with COVID-19. ANE has been related to intracranial cytokine storms, which result in blood-brain-barrier breakdown; and the newest evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might have cytokine storm syndrome and brain lesions that may include the thalamus, brainstem, cerebral white matter, and cerebellum. Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients are quite common (78 out J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of 214 patients; 36.4%), sometimes in the absence of other infection symptoms; and more severe patients were more likely to have neurological symptoms (45.5%), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness and induced skeletal muscle injury. A role of neurological involvement in sudden respiratory failure has already been suggested (Mao et. Al., 2020) and it has been shown, as said before, that Coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract. They may also invade the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), inducing neurological diseases: hypogeusia (5.6%) and anosmia (5.1%) are the most common PNS symptoms.",
