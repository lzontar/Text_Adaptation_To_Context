Cardiopulmonary failure in this population can arise from meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), as well as several congenital cardiac diseases. For the pediatric population, the most common disorders treated with ECMO are bacterial and viral pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, ARDS, sepsis, and cardiac disease. The experience with pediatric cardiac ECMO has been increasing over the past few years. Its use for treating postcardiotomy patients who are unable to wean from bypass as well as cardiac failure with bridge to transplantation have expanded greatly in the last decade. Some indications for ECMO that are not yet established clinically include emergency cardiopulmonary bypass and ECMO during CPR (ECPR) respiratory failure second to mediastinal compression (mass effect), smoke inhalation, severe asthma, or rewarming of hypercoagulopathic and hypothermic trauma patients (see Fig. 32 .1).",

The selection criteria are based on data from multiple institutions, patient safety, and mechanical limitations related to equipment.

A predictive mortality of greater than 80% despite maximal medical management is the criterion most institutions use to select patients for ECMO. ECMO is indicated when a reversible disease process is present, tissue oxygenation requirements are not being met, and ventilator treatment is causing more harm than good. All ECMO centers must develop their own criteria and continually evaluate their patient selection based on ongoing outcomes data. A discussion of generally accepted selection criteria for using ECMO follows.",

The catheter is inserted into the RIJ, with the tip in the RA. VV ECMO bypass is established by draining the RA via the RIJ, with reinfusion into a femoral vein. The advantages of VV and DLVV over VA ECMO include avoidance of arterial cannulation and permanent ligation of the carotid artery, maintaining pulsatile fl ow to the patient, continued blood fl ow to the lungs, and avoiding arterial emboli. A major limitation of DLVV ECMO is that there is mixing of unsaturated and saturated blood in the RA, because blood is both withdrawn and returned to the right atrium (RA). In addition, a fraction of the reinfused, oxygenated blood reenters the pump, called recirculation. Recirculation artifi cially raises the SvO 2 measurement on the pump and may limit oxygen delivery at higher fl ow rates.",

Most studies show approximately 20% (18-25%) ECMO survivors exhibit some type of handicap, with an 8-9% incidence of moderate-to-severe cognitive delay. Auditory defects are noted in over one-fourth of ECMO neonates at discharge, with sensorineural hearing loss in \u223c5%, speech and language delay in \u223c6% with roughly 10-15% requiring speech and language therapy.",
