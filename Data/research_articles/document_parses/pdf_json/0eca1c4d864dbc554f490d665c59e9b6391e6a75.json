First, personalized, preemptive usage reminders may support ongoing engagement with the system. While usage reminders, like SMS texts and call reminders, have been associated with increased usage of mobile learning applications, they are often post-hoc (i.e., sent after a usage gap has already been observed) [38] , which may be too late if users have already stopped engaging. Alternatively, sending too many reminders has been associated with a decrease in system usage, perhaps due to perceptions of being spammed [38] . Thus, there is a need for personalized, preemptive interventions based on users' likelihood to not persist in using the system. Researchers can use models trained on the aforementioned features to identify those users who are expected to have a gap in usage in the upcoming week. Furthermore, as we found that family involvement was associated with increased student engagement (following other prior work that did not use predictive modeling [10, 54] ), we suggest that parents or guardians also receive personalized messages to prompt children's use of the system. Second, analysis from both Study 1 and 2 showed that students' mastery (i.e., percentage of questions attempted correctly) was negatively associated with gaps in system usage. We thus hypothesize that users may feel a sense of achievement, or a positive sense of self-efficacy when they answer questions correctly, thus motivating them to continue learning (as in [1, 55] ). Voluntary educational applications may leverage mechanisms like dynamic question difficulty depending on correctness of responses, or system elements designed to give users this sense of achievement and mastery (e.g., virtual rewards to promote student engagement [8] ). Introducing such features may better motivate students to continue using the system.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 479, "end": 483, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 687, "end": 691, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1141, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1145, "text": "54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1628, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1632, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1903, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and Design Implications"}, {"text": "Finally, we analyzed these features across two studies with similar results.

We confirmed this by running post-hoc analyses on 8 weeks of data from Study 1 and found the same result. We see that in the first few weeks of usage, a user's calling pattern, as opposed to the interactions within each call, is more predictive of gaps, while the opposite is true for longer studies.

Future work may explore how to most effectively integrate such data collected infrequently in a survey or assessment with time-series data such as we have used here. In addition, the studies we trained our models on were in rural communities in low-resource contexts, and future work may investigate how predictive models of voluntary educational technology usage may differ across rural and urban contexts, and across international and inter-cultural contexts.

In this paper, we explore the efficacy of using machine learning models to predict gaps in children's usage of a mobile-based educational technology deployed in rural communities in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, to ultimately inform such personalized motivational support. We evaluate the predictive performance of multiple models trained on users' system interaction data, identify the most important features, and suggest design implications and directions for predicting gaps in usage of mobile-based learning technologies.
