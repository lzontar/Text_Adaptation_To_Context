Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms that regulate migration of effector T cells within the interstitial space of inflamed lungs are incompletely understood. Here, we show T cell migration in a mouse model of acute lung injury with two-photon imaging of intact lung tissue. Computational analysis indicates that T cells migrate with an intermittent mode, switching between confined and almost straight migration, guided by lung-associated vasculature. Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) is required for both high-speed migration and straight motion. By contrast, inhibition of G\u03b1 i signaling with pertussis toxin affects speed but not the intermittent migration of lung-infiltrating T cells. Computational modeling shows that an intermittent migration pattern balances both search area and the duration of contacts between T cells and target cells. These data identify that ROCK-dependent intermittent T cell migration regulates tissue-sampling during acute lung injury.",

            "text": "One important mechanism of effector T cell movement in tissues is chemotactic guidance, which facilitates T cell migration toward infectious foci in the skin and liver [4] [5] [6] . For example, expression of CXCR3, the receptor for the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, enables movement of CD8 + effector T cells toward infectious foci 4, 5 . In other contexts, for example in inflamed brain, skin and in tumors, T cells follow structural guidance cues, such as extracellular matrix fibres and the vasculature [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In the skin, such ''contact guidance'' of T cells is mediated by integrins 10 , whereas in tumors integrin-independent contact guidance has been identified 11 . In the absence of integrin-mediated adhesion, T cells may utilize three-dimensional migration strategies and squeeze through pre-formed channels using ''amoeboid'' motion along a path of least resistance 13 . In vitro experiments of various cell-types, including T cells, indicate that the cell-intrinsic RhoA-ROCK-myosin II pathway, a regulator of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, enables amoeboid squeezing [14] [15] [16] . Two-photon studies have confirmed that inhibition of ROCK or myosin II leads to a moderate reduction of the speed of naive T cells in the lymph node 14, 17 . Nevertheless, the relevance of ROCK during effector T cell migration in inflammatory tissues has not been addressed formally. It also needs to be considered that in some cases, such as in the pancreas of diabetic mice, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) migrate with apparent randomness, independent of environmental guidance cues 18, 19 .",

Currently, treatments are limited to supportive management 20 . The syndrome is initiated by an ''exudative phase'', which is characterized by a massive influx of immune cells, including T cells [20] [21] [22] . Data also indicate that effector T cells contribute actively to the progression and resolution of acute lung injury 22, 23 . In particular, experimental and clinical studies have established a link between lung injury and the accumulation of resident CD8 + T cells [24] [25] [26] [27] . Even though it is likely that efficient lung tissue-infiltration by CD8 + T cells is important during pathogenesis, interstitial T cell migration during acute lung injury is barely investigated. Although two-photon studies have shown that lung-infiltrating T cells perform active interstitial migration during infection and asthma, we know very little about the molecular mechanisms that enable tissue-navigation of lunginfiltrating T cells [28] [29] [30] [31] . A better understanding of the mechanisms that enable efficient lung-infiltration by T cells could be crucial for the development of improved therapies for acute lung injury and other lung diseases.",

Movement along lungassociated vasculature facilitates straight motion. Chemokines fine-tune the speed of lung-infiltrating T cells, but have a marginal effect on intermittent migration.

Analysis of peripheral lymph nodes, where T cells are segregated from the vasculature, revealed that most adoptively transferred GFP + T cells were negative for the intravascular CD3 stain (CD3 \u2212 ), which indicated that they were extravascular (Fig. 1a, left panel) . In lungs from healthy control mice, adoptively transferred effector T cells were mostly CD3 + , i.e., intravascular, indicating that these cells reach the lung vasculature, yet fail to enter the interstitial space (Fig. 1a, middle panel) . In contrast, analysis of lungs from mice that received intranasal LPS revealed that the majority of transferred effector CD8 + T cells were CD3 \u2212 , i.e., extravascular (Fig. 1a, right panel) . Staining with an anti-CD8 antibody confirmed that typically >90% of adoptively transferred cells were CD8 + (Fig. 1a) . Using immunofluorescence, we found that most adoptively transferred GFP + T cells were solitary in healthy control lungs, but after treatment with LPS, regions with high T cell density emerged (Fig. 1b , middle and right panels). Consistent with flow cytometry, most T cells in inflamed lungs were negative for intravascular CD3 stain (Fig. 1b , left and right panels). We then combined intravascular antibody staining with intranasal injection of an anti-CD45 antibody, as reported previously 34 , which revealed that~80% of the adoptively transferred T cells were protected from staining with either antibody (Fig. 1c) . The fact that most adoptively transferred T cells were spatially segregated from the vasculature and airways confirmed that during acute lung injury, the majority of effector CD8 + T cells reside in the interstitial lung space.",

In an initial analysis of T cell motion, we found that during the 15 min time frame typically used to analyze T cell movement in live tissues, T cells move at a median speed of 2.3 \u00b5m min \u22121 (Fig. 2a , green solid line). This is similar to speeds reported for T cell motility in peripheral sites, including skin, brain and lungs, but slower than the speed seen in lymph nodes 4, 12, 31, [35] [36] [37] . In the 15 min time window, we saw that a significant proportion of T cells showed no movement (0-1 \u00b5m min \u22121 ) while others moved at speeds of >7 \u00b5m min \u22121 . T cells moved with an even greater range of speeds when we determined the ''instant'' frame-to-frame speeds (90 s). A higher fraction of T cells showed no movement and some cells displayed speeds close to 10 \u00b5m min \u22121 (Fig. 2a , pink bars). Conversely, at much longer time periods of up to 2 h, we found that T cell speeds were more homogenous, with most T cells moving between 2 and 4 \u00b5m min \u22121 (Fig. 2a , blue dotted line). This suggested that lung-infiltrating T cells switch repetitively between fast and slow migration, reminiscent of previous reports of T cells in lymph nodes and infected brain 37 1 Effector T cells localize to the interstitium of the lung upon inflammation. GFP + effector T cells were adoptively transferred into control and LPStreated mice and analyzed two to five days later. a, b Anti-CD3 antibody was injected i.v., followed 5 min later by harvest of peripheral lymph nodes (PLN) and lungs. a Single-cell suspensions from the harvested organs were stained with an anti-CD8 antibody and analyzed with flow cytometry. We gated for GFP + (adoptively transferred) T cells and show the percentage of extravascular (CD3 \u2212 ) and CD8 + T cells. b Lungs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed with confocal microscopy, enabling co-visualization of GFP + T cells (green) and the CD3 surface stain (red). Arrows highlight double-positive cells. Scale bars: 20 \u00b5m. c Anesthetized mice were injected i.n. with anti-CD45 antibody. After a few minutes, anti-CD3 antibody was injected i.v., followed 5 min later by harvest of lungs. d We performed two-photon (2P) imaging of inflammatory regions of explanted lungs. T cells (green) and T cell trajectories (white) were superimposed on the image. Experiments were repeated three times NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-01032-2 ARTICLE Indeed, visual inspection of individual tracks revealed that T cells sometimes did not move at all for tens of minutes after which they switched to periods where they moved persistently with high speed (Fig. 2b , compare green and red segments; Supplementary Movie 2). This was further supported by speed autocorrelation analysis, which revealed a positive correlation for up to several minutes (Fig. 2c) . We then plotted the relationship between time and mean squared displacement (MSD). The relationship was roughly linear, and the slope of the curve, estimated by linear regression, revealed a motility coefficient of 6.45 \u00b5m 2 min \u22121 (Fig. 2d ). This motility coefficient is similar to that of memory T cells in the skin but significantly below observations of naive T cells in lymph nodes 15, 39, 40 , suggesting that the lung-environment is not particularly conducive to effective tissue-navigation. Taken together, we concluded that lung-infiltrating T cells display an intermittent migration pattern, characterized by repetitive inter-conversion between fast and slow migration.",

            "text": "First, we plotted the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of experimentally observed two-dimensional speeds of frame-toframe migration steps (Fig. 3a , solid black line), and tested whether it could be accurately fit by relevant theoretical distributions. We found that the Rayleigh distribution, which describes two-dimensional displacements of Brownian motion, was a poor fit for the experimental T cell speeds due to a major underrepresentation of low and high speeds (Fig. 3a , dashed black line). Conversely the best fit for power-law distributions, characteristic of superdiffusive Levy walks, showed a severe overrepresentation of low and high speeds (Fig. 3a , dash-pointed blue line). We then focused on the log-normal distribution, which we previously demonstrated as an appropriate model for the T cell speeds in lymph nodes 36 . We found that the best fit for a log-normal distribution led to a better recapitulation of experimental speeds (Fig. 3a , dotted green line; Supplementary Table 1) . However, the log-normal distribution failed to represent a small population of T cells with very high speeds (7.5 to 10 \u00b5m min \u22121 ), reflected by the region to the right of the intersection of the lognormal distribution and the experimental CDF (Fig. 3a) . Thus, curve fitting of speeds led to the identification of a small but significant subpopulation of T cells moving at high speeds. Altogether, these data showed that effector T cells in the lung do not move with Brownian or super-diffusive Levy walk strategies. We also quantified the autocorrelation of turning angles over time. The autocorrelation dropped strongly from 0.2 to 0.05 at time intervals between 1.5 and 3 min, but stayed positive for up to 10 min (Fig. 3b) . Thus, T cells maintain some level of directionally persistent migration for several minutes. This also argued against pure Brownian motion, which is characterized by uncorrelated turning angles.",

To corroborate this finding, we calculated for each experimental and randomized track a straightness Zscore. This score measured how many standard deviations the given displacement deviated from the expected displacement of a randomized track ensemble ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Comparison of the straightness Z-scores from experimental and randomized tracks revealed that experimental tracks were enriched for low (confined) and high (straight) straightness Z-scores (Fig. 4c ).

Recent two-photon studies have shown that effector T cells in various inflamed tissues, including skin, neural tissue and tumors, display contact guidance, i.e., move along structural guidance cues such as the vasculature and extracellular matrix fibers 7-12 . We hypothesized that the capacity of T cells to perform directional relocation in lung tissue is dependent on environmental guidance cues within the inflamed lung. We tested whether lunginfiltrating T cells move along the vasculature as observed for T cells in tumors and autoimmune brain lesions 7, 9, 11 . To experimentally address this, we co-visualized GFP + T cells and vasculature labeled by injection of fluorescently labeled lectin with two-photon microscopy. Lung-infiltrating T cells switch between straight and confined migration. GFP + effector T cells were injected i.v. into LPS-treated mice.

We also observed T cells that crossed vessels or that moved in the ''empty'' space in between vessels (Fig. 5a , b, white thin lines). To objectively quantify alignment between T cell movement and the vasculature, we employed a customized computational approach. Briefly, for each T cell track segment with a maximum displacement of 24 \u00b5m, an ''alignment angle'' was determined, which measures how well the T cell track is aligned with the main orientation of the surrounding vasculature (0 degrees: perfect alignment; 90 degrees: perpendicular crossing of vessel; for a more in depth discussion of methodology, see methods and Supplementary Fig. 3) . As a control, we generated for each experimental track a randomized track derivative and measured its alignment angle. We found that experimental tracks were slightly but significantly better aligned with the vasculature than randomized control tracks (Fig. 5d ).",

Analysis of average track speeds revealed a significant reduction after treatment with PTX, similar to previous observations in lung tumors and infected brain 11, 38 (median Fig. 6a ; Supplementary Movie 9). Consistent with the reduction in speed, time vs. mean squared displacement measurements revealed that PTX-treatment also reduced rate of tissue infiltration by lung-infiltrating T cells by 50% ( Fig. 6b ; motility coefficients: before treatment: 6.80 \u00b5m 2 min \u22121 ; after treatment: 3.59 \u00b5m 2 min \u22121 ). Interestingly, when we analyzed T cell tracks for directional persistence using the straightness Zscore as previously described, PTX-treatment did not lead to significant changes (Fig. 6c) . This suggested that while chemokines deposited within lung tissues can regulate T cell speed, intra-tissue chemokine gradients were dispensable for the intermittent migration of lung-infiltrating T cells. This was corroborated by in vitro experiments, where PTX inhibited spontaneous T cell migration through transwells even when no external chemokine gradients were generated ( Supplementary  Fig. 4a) . Moreover, chemokines CXCL10, CCL21, and CXCL12 all induced migration ( Supplementary Fig. 4b) .",

RhoA-ROCK-myosin II pathway has been shown to be important in promoting the speed of naive T cells navigating within lymph nodes 14, 15, 17 . We also found that in vitro, chemokines can induce ERK and RhoA-ROCK signaling pathways in CTL (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) , as shown previously for other cell types 17, [46] [47] [48] . We then tested whether ROCK promotes migration of effector T cells within the inflamed lung environment. To this end, we used our two-photon imaging model of acute lung injury and tracked lung-infiltrating T cells before and after addition of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. The ROCK inhibitor strongly reduced the average track speed of lung-infiltrating T cells (median speeds: before treatment: 2.5 \u00b5m min \u22121 ; after treatment: 0.8 \u00b5m min \u22121 ; Fig. 7a ; Supplementary Movie 10). ROCK inhibition also led to a massive reduction of the motility coefficient, as determined by time vs. MSD analysis ( Fig. 7b ; motility coefficient: before treatment: 7.08 \u00b5m 2 min \u22121 ; after treatment: 1.65 \u00b5m 2 min \u22121 ). Importantly, the ROCK inhibitor also led to a significant reduction of the straightness of analyzed tracks (Fig. 7c) . Notably, inhibition of ROCK impaired migration of lung-infiltrating T cells more strongly than inhibition of chemokine signaling (compare Fig. 6 with Fig. 7) , suggesting that ROCK-activity is only partially dependent on chemokine-dependent G\u03b1 i signaling. This was confirmed in vitro, where treatment with the ROCKinhibitor Y-27632 reduced spontaneous transwell migration much more strongly than PTX (Supplementary Fig. 4a) . These results showed that ROCK-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling is a major requirement for switching between fast and directionally persistent migration of lung-infiltrating T cells during acute lung injury.",

We find that T cells display an intermittent migration pattern, characterized by transitions between confinement and straight relocation. The directionality of T cells is not random but partially aligned with the architecture of the lung tissue. Mechanistically, the RhoA-ROCK-myosin II signaling pathway enabled high-speed straight migration of lung-infiltrating T cells.

The generation of long continuous trajectories is feasible because we captured movie sequences of several hours duration and performed correction for tissue-drift, a common problem during two-photon imaging 51 . Furthermore, in our system the T cells move with relatively low speeds, so that only very few cells ''escape'' from the image volume during movie capture. The generation of such long observation periods is crucial because shorter timescales gave the misleading impression that the T cell population is heterogeneous and composed of a subset of cells that do not move at all while other cells move with high speed and directional persistence (Fig. 2) . Longer movies suggest that in fact individual T cells switched between periods of confinement, lasting typically tens of minutes up to hours, and ballistic relocation.",

In another study, intermittent T cell migration in infected brain was supported by good fits between empirical data and computer simulations, but direct observation of intermittent migration was lacking 38 .

Our computational model suggests that intermittent migration includes both periods of ballistic relocation leading to increased target identification while periodic confinement promotes more intimate and longer-lasting contacts with target cells. This could be important because some estimates have suggested that full T cell activation may require up to 10 min of contact, depending on peptide affinity and amount 55 . Moreover, CTLs are relatively inefficient at killing individual target cells in vivo, and cumulative contacts of 10-60 min have been shown to occur before target cell lysis 49 .

For example, while track analysis of T cells in the skin was consistent with chemotaxis 4, 5 , the bias was very subtle and only detectable with sophisticated analytical tools 5 . In the brain, inhibition of chemokine receptor-dependent G\u03b1 i -type G protein signaling with PTX reduced speed of CTL by <50% but did not change motility qualitatively 38 . Similarly, PTX reduced the motility coefficient of T cells in lung tumors by 50% 11 . Here, we report that treatment with PTX has a similar effect on the motility of CTL within inflamed lungs: motility coefficients went down by 50%, but only a marginal effect on the intermittent mode of migration was observed as PTX-inhibited T cells still showed both confined and directionally persistent migration. While we still do not know a precise mechanism for ROCK activation by chemokines in vivo, our results suggest that chemokines are not required for the straight migration of T cells in the lungs, which is distinct to guidance by chemokine trails in the trachea of influenza-infected animals 42 .",

Indeed, inhibition of ROCK led to a massive reduction of both speed and directional persistence of lung-infiltrating T cells. It is striking that inhibition of the ROCK-pathway leads to a more pronounced reduction of migration than inhibition of chemokine-dependent G\u03b1 i signaling.

If the mouse showed any signs of spontaneous breathing it was given a supplemental \u00bd dose of Avertin before surgery. The lung was exposed through a left thoracotomy and the dorsal surface of the left lobe (~1/3 of the lobe) was attached to a thin flexible plastic support using a thin film of VetBond. The mouse is placed on the lower plate of a custom built chamber and the upper plate of the chamber is assembled and lowered over the exposed left lung. The plastic support attached to the bottom of the lung is carefully lifted to bring the lung into contact with the cover glass lining the bottom of the upper chamber plate and the plastic support secured with a hair-pin. The mouse is maintained at 37\u00b0C by warming both upper and lower plates using a Warner TC-344C Dual Channel Temperature Controller (Warner Instruments). Anesthesia is maintained with 1.5-2% isoflurane during imaging. Mice are imaged for up to 4 h and given supplemental fluids (150 \u00b5l saline s.c.) for any experiment lasting more than 1.5 h. The imaging procedure is terminal and at the end of the experiment anesthesia is increased to 3% isoflurane and mice are euthanized by cervical dislocation while deeply anesthetized. The upper chamber is filled with water and video-rate and time-lapse imaging were performed with a custom built two-photon microscope equipped with a 1.0 NA 20\u00d7 water dipping objective (Olympus) running ImageWarp acquisition software (A&B Software) as previously described 61, 62 .

Briefly, we collected, for each single track, all vector pairs separated by defined time intervals t. We then measured the cosine of the turning angle \u03b8 of all vector pairs. The cosine has a value of minus one for vectors that point in opposite directions and one for vectors that point in same direction. By calculating the mean of all n cosines per time interval, we obtained an autocorrelation function for individual tracks:",

To quantify the alignment of T cell trajectories with the surrounding vasculature, we analyzed image-sequences containing cell-trajectories and a channel with a lectin-stain of the vasculature. To simplify the analysis, each track was split into track-segments so that each segment had a maximum displacement of roughly 24 \u00b5m. We then processed each segment with an image analysis algorithm and obtained an ''alignment angle'' that measures how much the segment deviates from the main orientation of the vasculature, with a range from 0 degrees (perfect alignment) to 90 degrees (perpendicular movement over vessel). Briefly, each segment was converted from a series of vectors into an ''original'' rasterized pixel-image ( Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) . The rasterization enabled a pixel-by-pixel comparison between the track-segment and the corresponding intensity of the vascular stain ( Supplementary Fig. 3d) . Specifically, we calculated the median ''overlap intensity'' of all vascular pixels that overlapped with the given segment, and we similarly measured the overlap intensity of a perpendicular segment ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ). If the analyzed segment is well aligned with the vasculature, we expect a high value of the ''overlap ratio'' between the overlap indices of given and perpendicular segments.",

To quantify the contact duration between motile T cells and target cells, we simulated T cell migration in an area of 1 mm 2 for 25 h. Initially, the region was populated randomly with 200 T cells of 10 \u00d7 10 \u00b5m 2 size (no overlap between different T cells was allowed) and analogously with 200 target cells. Target cells were stationary. For each T cell, a trajectory was created that contained 1000 positions, separated by time-steps of 90 s duration. The specifics of how these trajectories were generated depended on the type of migration that was simulated, i.e., straight, confined, and intermittent. Straight T cells moved with a constant speed of 6 \u00b5m min \u22121 and obtained a random orientation that they maintained throughout the simulation. The trajectories of the confined cells were based on experimentally obtained T cell tracks. Briefly, all tracks were split into subtracks with a duration of 20 timesteps and these subtracks were filtered so that only confined subtracks (straightness Zscore < 1.5) remained. For each simulated T cell, these tracks were stitched together randomly so that tracks of sufficient duration (>=1000 timesteps) were obtained. Tracks for intermittent migration were obtained directly from experimental data. For each simulated T cell, experimental tracks of 2 h duration were stitched together randomly. When a T cell moved out of the field of view, it was randomly re-positioned within the field of view. Contacts between T cells and target cells were registered whenever T cells and target cells shared overlapping pixels.",
