            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that first emerged in late 2019 is responsible for a pandemic of severe respiratory illness. People infected with this highly contagious virus can present with clinically inapparent, mild, or severe disease. Currently, the virus infection in individuals and at the population level is being monitored by PCR testing of symptomatic patients for the presence of viral RNA. There is an urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests to identify all infected individuals, irrespective of clinical symptoms, to conduct surveillance and implement strategies to contain spread. As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is poorly conserved between SARS-CoVs and other pathogenic human coronaviruses, the RBD represents a promising antigen for detecting CoV-specific antibodies in people. Here we use a large panel of human sera (63 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 71 control subjects) and hyperimmune sera from animals exposed to zoonotic CoVs to evaluate RBD's performance as an antigen for reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. By day 9 after the onset of symptoms, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen was highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%) for antibodies induced by SARS-CoVs. We observed a strong correlation between levels of RBD binding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in patients. Our results, which reveal the early kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, support using the RBD antigen in serological diagnostic assays and RBD-specific antibody levels as a correlate of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in people.",

Currently, the main method for laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs. There is an urgent need for highly specific and sensitive antibody detection assays to answer fundamental questions about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and to implement and evaluate population-level control programs (2) . Efforts to understand the pathogenesis and define risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2 disease have been hampered by our inability to identify all infected individuals, irrespective of clinical symptoms. To contain the pandemic, many countries resorted to the widespread quarantine of cities and regions. By deploying reliable antibody assays for population-level testing, it will be possible to obtain the highresolution spatial data needed to implement policies for containing the epidemic and informing strategies for re-opening communities and cities.",

In recent studies, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has shown promise as an antigen for specific antibody detection (4, 17, 18) . Here we report the production of properly folded recombinant receptor binding domains (RBDs) from the spike proteins of SARS and common-cold HCoVs in mammalian cells. We use these recombinant antigens and a large diverse panel of human and animal sera to evaluate the RBD as an antigen for SARS-CoV-2 serology. We demonstrate that the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen is highly sensitive and specific for detection of antibodies induced by SARS-CoVs. We also observed a strong correlation between the levels of RBD-binding antibodies and levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in patients.

The surface accessible receptor binding domain (RBD) on the S1 subunit binds to receptors on target cells, whereas the exposure of the fusion loop in the S2 subunit induces fusion of the viral envelope to the host cellular membranes (19) . The RBDs of SARS-CoVs, which bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cells, are also a major target of human antibodies ( Fig. 1A and B) . As the RBD is a common target of human antibodies and poorly conserved between SARS-CoVs and other pathogenic human coronaviruses (Fig. 1C) , this domain is a promising candidate for use in antibody-based diagnostic assays. We expressed the RBD of 2003 and 2019 SARS-Co-Vs and four common human coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU-1, -OC43, -NL63 and -229E) as fusion proteins that were secreted from human cells. The recombinant RBDs were purified from the cell culture medium by affinity chromatography and purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D ). We used sera and monoclonal antibodies from animals immunized with SARS-CoV-1 or -2 spike proteins to assess the structural integrity of the purified recombinant RBD antigens. Pooled serum from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein had antibodies that bound well to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and poorly to the RBDs of SARS-CoV-1 and other common HCoVs (Fig. 1E ). Sera from mice or rabbits immunized with SARS-CoV-1 or cross-reactive monoclonal antibody 240C reacted with the RBDs of SARS CoV-1 and -2 but not common human CoVs (Fig. 1E ). Human serum collected before SARS-CoV-2 emerged contained antibodies to common \u03b1-and \u03b2-HCoVs (NL63 and HKU-1) but not to SARS-CoV RBD antigens (Fig. 1E) . These results suggest that the purified recombinant RBD antigens retain native structures required for specific antibody binding.",

The sera were tested at a high concentration (1:20 dilution) for binding to the recombinant RBDs from SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and common \u03b1-and \u03b2-HCoVs (Fig. 2) . Sera collected from healthy American adults (N = 20) before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic frequently had high levels of antibodies to the recombinant RBDs of NL63 and HKU-1 CoVs but not to SARS-CoVs ( Fig.  2A) . We also tested archived pre-SARS-CoV-2 pandemic sera collected from individuals in South Asia, the Caribbean and Central America who had recently recovered from arbovirus infections. As in the case of healthy adults from the USA, most of the subjects from different parts of the world had high levels of antibodies to the RBD of common HCoVs but no antibodies to the RBD of SARS-CoVs (Fig. 2B ). To assess if other human respiratory viruses stimulated antibodies that cross-reacted with the recombinant SARS-CoV RBD, we tested early convalescent sera from people with laboratory The known pathogenic human CoVs are members of the \u03b1-coronavirus and \u03b2-coronavirus genera (Fig. 3A) . HCoV-NL63 and 229E are two \u03b1-coronaviruses that frequently infect and cause a mild common-cold-like illness in most people. HCoV-OC43 and HKU-1 are two group 2A \u03b2coronaviruses that also commonly infect people and cause mild disease. Most adults (>90%) have antibodies to these common-cold HCoVs. SARS-CoV-1 and -2 and MERS-CoV are group 2B and 2C zoonotic \u03b2-coronaviruses that have recently crossed into humans and caused severe illness. The \u03b1-and \u03b2coronavirus genera also contain a large number of zoonotic viruses that infect different animal hosts, which have not been implicated in human disease to date. To further assess the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for serology, we obtained and tested sera from people who had recently recovered from a laboratory-confirmed common-cold HCoV infection and sera from guinea pigs immunized with different animal CoVs ( Fig. 3 B and C) . None of the immune sera from people exposed to recent HCoV infections cross-reacted with the recombinant RBD of SARS-CoVs. None of the guinea pigs vaccinated with different zoonotic CoVs had antibodies that cross-reacted with the recombinant SARS-CoV RBDs ( Fig. 3B and C). These results establish that most individuals, including people who have been recently exposed to acute common HCoV infections, do not have detectable levels of cross-reactive antibodies to the recombinant RBD of SARS-CoVs.",

All the samples were tested for binding of total immunoglobulin (Ig) and IgM antibodies to recombinant RBD antigens from SARS-CoVs and common-cold HCoVs. The sensitivity of the assay was high (98% and 81% respectively for Ig and IgM) for specimens collected 9 days or more after onset of symptoms (Fig. 4A ). As expected, overall sensitivity was lower (57% and 43% respectively for Ig and IgM) for specimens collected between 7 and 8 days after onset of symptoms (Fig. 4A ). With samples collected 9 days or more after onset of symptoms, we observed some Ig and IgM antibody cross reactivity with the RBD of SARS-CoV-1 (67% and 30% respectively for Ig and IgM), which was anticipated as these viruses are closely related group 2B \u03b2-coronaviruses (20, 21) . When the specimens were further analyzed to estimate the timing of seroconversion, we observed a marked transition from seronegative to seropositive for both Ig and IgM about 9 days after the onset of symptoms ( Fig. 4A and B ). By day 9 after onset of symptoms, most patients had high end-point titers in the RBD Ig ELISA (Fig.  S1 ). To analyze the kinetics of all three of the major isotypes of serum antibodies within the first 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms, we separately measured IgG, IgA, and IgM in 49 serum samples obtained from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at >9 days after onset of symptoms. Most individuals (46/49) developed IgG responses (Fig. 4C ). IgA and IgM responses were observed less frequently (IgA = 38/49, IgM =34/49) than IgG (Fig. 4C ). For 14 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we had two specimens collected at different times early in the infection (Fig. 4D ). Two subjects (P70 and P50) were seronegative within the first 4 days and seropositive for both Ig and IgM 9 or more days after onset (Fig. 4D ). For three subjects (P58, P56, P52) the acute samples were collected after 9 days and the convalescent samples were collected 21 days or more after onset. In these individuals both acute and convalescent samples were positive, and we observed an increase in Ig and IgM levels in the second specimen. For the remaining 9 subjects, the acute specimen was collected on day 7 after onset and the convalescent specimen was collected >9 days after onset. Six out of the 9 subjects already had specific Ig, IgM or both in the acute specimen collected on day 7. All the subjects except one (P54) seroconverted or had elevated levels of antibody in the convalescent sample collected >9 days after onset of symptoms. These results indicate that most people seroconvert between days 7 and 9 after onset of symptoms. Subject P54 was an outlier and did not develop specific Ig or IgM antibodies. All the individuals with documented SARS-CoV-2 had Ig but not IgM antibodies that bound to the RBD of common HCoVs, which is consistent with their high prevalence in humans (Fig. 4A ). These results demonstrate that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is a highly sensitive antigen for antibody detection in patients 9 days or more after onset of symptoms.",

            "text": "The administration of convalescent plasma containing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is being evaluated for patients with severe disease. While the FDA has not approved convalescent plasma therapy, on May 1, 2020, the FDA recommended that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers of at least 1:160 should be used for human passive immunization studies. Further, the FDA also recommended that a titer of 1:80 may be acceptable if an alternative matched unit is not available. As the RBD domain of S protein is critical for viral entry, antibodies targeting this domain of SARS-CoV-2 are likely to be neutralizing and potentially protective, as is seen in cell culture and animal models for other pathogenic CoVs (19, 22) . To assess the relationship between the RBD-binding activity and the neutralizing antibody response, we tested 50 PCR-confirmed SARS-COV-2 patient immune sera in a SARS-CoV-2 luciferase neutralization assay (Fig. 5 ). As judged by the Spearman test (\u03c1 = 0.86, P < 0.0001), we observed that the magnitude of the total RBD-binding Ig antibody strongly correlated with the levels of neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 patients ( Currently, patients who have had a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by RT-PCR or a serologic test, and who are clear of symptoms for at least 14 days, are recruited for convalescent plasma donation. We evaluated the neutralizing potency in patient samples collected between 1 and 40 days with a titer of at least 1:160 (Fig. 5D ). We observed that 32% of patients (7/22) developed weak to no neutralizing antibodies even 21 days after onset of symptoms, suggesting that days after the start of symptoms is a poor determinant of the levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in the patients included in our study, particularly within the early convalescent phase (<6 weeks). To evaluate whether a simple RBD ELISA can be used as a surrogate for neutralizing potency in SARS-COV-2 patients, we analyzed the relationship between the level of total Ig antibody to RBD and a neutralizing antibody titer of at least 1:160. We observed that 22/24 people who had a substantial total Ig binding antibody to RBD (>1.5 OD) also developed a robust neutralizing antibody titer (Fig. 5E) . Notably, only 3/26 people who developed a relatively weak RBD-binding antibody had a neutralizing antibody titer higher than 1:160. One subject (P54) neither seroconverted for RBD antigen nor developed neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 4D and E, and Fig. S2 ).",

            "text": "To address the need for reliable antibody-based diagnostic assays, we focused on the RBD domain of the spike protein because this region is poorly conserved between different CoVs and is also known to be a major target of human antibodies (19) . A major concern with using a protein domain instead of a full-length protein or whole virion for antibody detection is possible reduction in assay sensitivity. However, we observed that over 95% of SARS-CoV-2 patients developed antibodies to the RBD 9 days after onset of symptoms. Although our study included only a few recent convalescent sera and relatively large numbers of presumably positive samples from past common human CoV infections, the high specificity of the RBD antigen was also evident with the serum specimens from animals that were hyperimmunized with other zoonotic CoVs. Some patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had antibodies that cross-reacted with the RBD of SARS-CoV-1. We have not tested the more distantly related RBD Ag from MERS CoV or the serum samples from individuals with confirmed MERS infection. Since SARS-CoV-1 and MERS CoV seroprevalence are very low in humans, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-1 is unlikely to pose diagnostic challenges. Other recent studies that have been published or under peer review also support the high specificity and sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD for antibody detection (4, 17, 18) . Amanat and colleagues tested samples from SARS-CoV-2 patients collected at the beginning of the epidemic in the USA and reported that the full length S protein and the RBD performed well for specific antibody detection (17) . Okba and colleagues compared the performance of different SARS-CoV-2 antigens for antibody detection using samples from 10 SARS-CoV-2 patients in Europe (4) . For the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, they observed levels of specificity and sensitivity that were comparable to our results reported here. The S2 subunit, which comprises conserved regions between CoVs, was less specific than the RBD (4). Perera and colleagues evaluated the performance of the RBD for antibody detection using samples from 24 SARS-CoV-2 patients in Hong Kong (18) . They also observed high specificity and sensitivity when patients were tested 10 days or more after onset of illness. Our study with 77 specimens from 63 documented SARS-CoV-2 patients, which includes patients presenting to hospitals in North Carolina and Georgia with varying levels of severity, together with these recent studies conducted in New York, Europe and Hong Kong, strongly support the use of SARS-CoV-2 RBD as an antigen for antibody detection. We designed the assay for separate detection of RBDspecific total Ig and IgM. As the pandemic is ongoing and most infections are likely to have occurred within the past few months, infected individuals have variable levels of antigen-specific IgG, IgM and IgA (Fig. 4C ). To maximize assay sensitivity and to prevent different antibody isotypes competing for binding sites and reducing assay signal, we measured total Ig. We did not observe any decrease in assay specificity by designing the assay to monitor levels of total Ig instead of IgG binding to the RBD even at high serum concentration or with hyperimmune sera. Our study showed that IgM and IgA antibodies can also be detected using RBD-based serological assays. Both IgA and IgM antibodies are relatively short lived and indicative of a recent exposure. When conducting large scale population level surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, it will be possible to distinguish recent from remote infections by measuring both total Ig and IgM (or IgA) binding to the RBD.",

In animal studies with SARS-CoV-1, virus-neutralizing antibodies were strongly correlated with protective immune responses (19) . We observed a striking correlation between the levels of RBD antibodies in patients and the ability of patient sera to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus. Other groups have recently reported finding a strong correlation between spike/RBD antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (4, 17, 18) . Our results point out that roughly one-third of patients develop very low or no neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and that Ig and IgM antibodies are useful predictors of neutralizing antibody levels in patients in the early convalescent phase (<6 weeks). As people developing a high level of RBD-binding antibodies (>1.5 OD) also have a robust neutralizing response, a simple RBD-based ELISA can be a useful tool to identify blood plasma donors. While further studies are needed to fully evaluate RBD antibodies as correlate of protective immunity, the results to date indicate that RBD antibodies are a promising correlate of protection in the early convalescent phase. A simple antibody detection assay that also predicts individuallevel risk of disease will be a major advance for vaccine development and immunogenicity of vaccines because SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays are time-consuming and require BSL-3 containment.",

The cutoff values determined by the receiver operating (ROC) curve analysis (Fig S3) for the ELISA assay are indicated by the broken line. Scatter plots were generated using individual serum binding to RBD antigen (y-axis) versus SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers (x-axis). The nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) and the associated two-tailed p-value were calculated (GraphPad Prism, version 5.0).

(D) Total Ig antibody binding to RBD as a surrogate for identifying people with high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. A total of 50 serum samples collected between 1 and 39 days after onset of symptoms from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 subjects were measured for Ig and IgM binding to spike RBD antigen and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay.
