Until now, studies of this antiviral agent have not yielded 24 resistant viruses. Here, we demonstrate that an E460D substitution, in the active site of 25 TBEV RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), confers resistance to Galidesivir in cell 26 culture. Stochastic molecular simulations indicate that the steric freedom caused by the 27 E460D substitution increases close electrostatic interactions between the inhibitor and the 28 interrogation residue of the TBEV RdRp motif F, resulting in rejection of the analogue as an 29 incorrect/modified nucleotide.

These viruses are typically transmitted to humans by 58 mosquito or tick vectors. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a typical flavivirus 59 transmitted by Ixodes spp. ticks. TBEV is a causative agent of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), a 60 severe and potentially lethal neuroinfection in humans (Baier, 2011). The disease is 61 prevalent in the sylvatic areas of Europe and Asia with more than 13,000 cases of TBE being 62 reported annually (Dumpis, Crook, and Oksi 1999; Heinz and Mandl 1993). Clinical 63 presentation of TBE ranges from mild fever to severe encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. In 64 many cases, survivors of TBE suffer long-term or even permanent debilitating sequelae 65 (Ruzek, Dobler, and Mantke 2010).

Several 72 molecules, mainly nucleoside analogues, were found to be potent inhibitors of the TBEV NS5 73 polymerase activity (Eyer et al., 2015; 2016; 2017a,b;. The mechanism of action of 74 these nucleoside analogues is based on their initial metabolization to the active triphosphate 75 (nucleotide) form by cellular kinases and subsequent incorporation into the nascent genome 76 by the RdRp, leading to premature chain termination (Eyer et al., 2018) . Galidesivir (also 77 known as BCX4430 or Immucillin-A, Figure 1A ) is an adenosine analogue with two structural 78 modifications: (i) it is a C-nucleoside characterized by a C-glycosidic bond instead of the 79 usual N-glycosidic bond, and (ii) the furanose oxygen has been replaced by an imino group 80 (Warren et al., 2014). Galidesvir is known to have a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against 81 more than 20 different medically important RNA viruses across nine different virus families 82 (flaviviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, 83 filoviruses, orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses) (Warren et al., 2014; Westover et al., 84 2018; Julander et al., 2014, 2017; Taylor et al., 2016; De Clercq, 2016).

The exploration difference between the RdRps is also 259 demonstrated by the distance of Galidesivir to aa position 453, indicated by the cutoff 260 distance ~21 \u00c5 in the wild type RdRp (Figure 4C). Average distances to aa453 are, interrogation residue of motif F is highly conserved in flavivirus RdRps and its 265 electrostatic interaction facilitates incorporation of favorable/correct incoming nucleotides 266 (Vald\u00e9s et al., 2016; Butcher et al., 2001; Bressanelli et al., 2002). Figure 4D shows that the 267 distances of both mutation sites to Arg473 of the TBEV RdRp within motif F are located 9 \u00c5 268 and 15 \u00c5 away. The average distances of Galidesivir to Arg473 during the stochastic 269 simulations are also noted. Due to the steric freedom within the active site caused by E460D 270 (Figure 4A), both substitutions permit closer Galidesivir interactions with the interrogation 271 Arg473. Close proximity to the interrogation residue will thereby increase an adenosine analogue originally developed for filovirus infection 276 treatment (Ebola and Marburg) with high antiviral potency against a broad spectrum of RNA 277 viruses (Warren et al., 2014; Taylor et al., 2016), including TBEV (Eyer et al., 2017b) and 278 other medically important arthropod-borne flaviviruses (Warren et al., 2014; Julander et al., 279 2014; Eyer et al., 2017b; Julander et al., 2017). Currently, this compound entered first-in-280 human clinical studies that focused on intramuscular administration in healthy volunteers 281 showing promising pharmacokinetics properties and good tolerability (Taylor et al., 2016). 282 This makes Galidesivir a promising candidate drug to treat patients with TBE or with other 283 flaviviral infections. However, antiviral therapy based on small molecule inhibitors of viral 284 replication can be accompanied by rapid evolution of drug-resistance which can abolish the 285 progress of infection treatment and finally lead to the failure of the therapy. Therefore, for 286 each new antiviral agent, the risks of resistance are important to assess in terms of (i) 287 identification of key mutations conferring virus drug-resistance and (ii) phenotype 288 characterization of drug-resistant mutants. 289 Serial in vitro passaging of TBEV in the presence of increasing concentrations of 290 Galidesivir (up to 50 \u00b5M) resulted in generation of two drug-resistant TBEV mutants which 291 were approximately 7-fold less sensitive to Galidesivir than the mock-selected wild-type 292 virus. The first TBEV mutant was characterized by a single amino acid change E460D; the 293 other one carried two amino acid changes, E460D and Y453H. Both mutations mapped to 294 the active site of the viral RdRp. Location of the resistance-associated mutations within the 295 viral RdRp active site is essential to understand the mechanism of action of Galidesivir; this 296 compound prevents the binding of subsequent nucleotides to the RdRp active site, being 297 considered a non-obligate chain terminator of viral RNA synthesis (Warren et al., 2014; De 298 Clercq and Neyts, 2009). Single amino acid changes within the RdRp were previously 299 identified in flaviviruses resistant to structurally different nucleoside analogues, as 300 exemplified by the mutations S603T, S604T and S282T conferring a high-level resistance to 301 2\u00b4-C-methylated nucleosides in TBEV, Zika virus and hepatits C virus, respectively (Eyer et al., 302 2017a; Hercik et al., 2017; Migliaccio et al., 2003). In Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever virus, the 303 mutation S603T was associated with additional amino acid substitutions located in the NS5 304 RdRp active site, particularly with C666S and M644V (Flint et al., 2014). 305 Using a previously described reverse genetics system (Aubry et al., 2014; Driouich et 306 al., 2018) we have demonstrated, that the E460D mutation alone is crucial for resistance of that Y453H can represent a compensation mutation or was acquired randomly. TBEV mutant showed similar growth kinetics to the wild-type virus, when 316 cultured in vitro on PS cell monolayers. Although, a decreased replication capacity of the 317 E460D mutant was observed in the first few hours after cell culture infection (0 -12 hours 318 p.i.), both viruses reached a peak titre of about 10 5 -10 6 PFU/mL at days 2 -4 after 319 infection. Similarly, the plaque morphology of the E460D mutant and wild-type virus were 320 almost identical to each other; large, clear and round plaques reflected rapid and aggressive 321 spread of both mutant and wild-type viruses in PS cell cultures. Thus, the E460D TBEV 322 mutant differs from the recently isolated S603T TBEV mutant resistant to 2\u00b4-C-methyladed 323 nucleosides; the S603T mutant exerted significantly decreased replication capacity in PS cells 324 and completely different plaque morphology (small, turbid plaques) compared with the wild-325 type virus (Eyer et al., 2017a). Our results demonstrate that antiviral resistance developed 326 against two structurally different nucleoside analogues having the same mechanism of 327 action can result in different effects on viral replication capacity in cell culture. Interestingly, 328 in some drug-resistant virus mutants the cell-type dependent replication fitness was 329 observed, as seen in chikungunya virus resistant to T-705 showing the attenuated phenotype 330 in mosquito cell culture, whereas the replication fitness in Vero cells was similar to that of 331 the wild type (Delang et al., 2018). 332 Although, the introduction of the E460D mutation affects amplification of the virus in 333 PS cell culture (i.e., in vitro) only slightly, the E460D substitution resulted in a total loss of 334 neuroinvasiveness for mice, in vivo; the E460D-infected animals all survived and displayed no 335 clinical signs of neuroinfection during the 28-day experimental period. In contrast, infection 336 with wild-type virus resulted in fatal infections for all animals. We propose that the E460D 337 substitution could affect viral capacity to cross host barriers or responses that restrict the 338 virus infection and translocation to the target tissues/organs in vivo but such possibilities do 339 not occur during virus replication in PS cell culture, i.e. in vitro. Nevertheless, similar levels 340 of attenuation in vivo have previously been reported for drug-resistant RNA or DNA viral 341 mutants, i.e. for TBEV resistance to 2\u00b4-C-methylated nucleosides (Eyer et al., 2017a), chikungunya virus resistance to T-705 (Delang et al., 2018), Ribavirin-resistance to porcine 343 reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Khatun et al., 2016), vaccinia virus resistance 344 to acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (Gammon et al., 2008), and pleconaril-resistance to 345 coxsackievirus (Groarke and Pevear, 1999). 346 The mutant genotype rapidly reverted to wild-type, when the virus was cultured in PS 347 cell monolayers in the absence of selection agents. However, reversion was not observed, 348 when the virus was cultured in the presence of Galidesivir in concentrations ranging from 349 6.25 to 25 \u00b5M. Thus, under the selection pressure of Galidesivir, the mutation provides a 350 replicative advantage over wild-type variants in the virus quasispecies population resulting in 351 predominance of the mutant in the infected cell culture, despite the fact that the replication 352 characteristics of both variants in cell culture are similar. 353 We conclude that the resistance of TBEV to the nucleoside analogue Galidesivir is 354 conferred by the single amino acid substitution E460D in the NS5 protein. Although this 355 subtle mutation in the active site of the viral RdRp occurs after a few in vitro passages of 356 TBEV in the presence of Galidesivir, the E460D TBEV mutant displays dramatically attenuated 357 phenotype in mice showing high survival rates and reduction of clinical signs of 358 neuroinfection. The stochastic molecular simulations indicate that the steric freedom caused 359 by the E460D mutation increases close electrostatic interactions between Galidesivir and the 360 interrogation residue of the TBEV RdRp motif F. Such close electrostatic interactions will 361 reject the analogue as an incorrect nucleotide. The E460D substitution did not confer cross-362 resistance to unrelated antiviral nucleoside analogues, such as 7-deaza-2\u00b4--characterized, low-passage TBEV strain Hypr (Pospisil et al., 1954), a member 379 of the European TBEV subtype, was used in this study. Before use, the virus was sub-cultured 380 intracerebrally six times in suckling mice. Porcine kidney stable (PS) cells (Kozuch and Mayer, 381 1975) were used for viral subculture, selection of drug-resistant viruses, viral growth kinetics 382 studies, and plaque assays. The cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in Leibovitz (L-15) medium 383 supplemented with 3% newborn calf serum and a 1% mixture of Penicillin and glutamine 384 (Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic). BHK-21 cells (obtained from the American Type 385 Culture Collection [ATCC]), used for transfection of Hypr-derived subgenomic fragments, 386 were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) containing 7% 387 bovine serum, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and glutamine. Galidesivir (BCX4430) and 4\u00b4-azido-388 aracytidine (RO-9187) were purchased from Medchemexpress (Stockholm, Sweden); 2\u00b4-C-389 methyladenosine and 7-deaza-2\u00b4-C-methyladenosine were from Carbosynth (Compton, UK). 390 For in vitro studies, the test compounds were solubilized in 100% DMSO to yield 10 Figure 4). Fragment III was used as template to generate by PCR two overlapping amplicons 439 following the original ISA method (Aubry et al., 2014). Unmodified primers were used to 440 generate two unmodified amplicons (i.e. production of wild-type virus). Mutated primers 441 located on the targeted region were used to generate two mutated amplicons (i.e. 442 production of mutated viruses, denoted as E460D-Rec, Y453H-Rec, and E460D/Y453Hwas performed using the Platinum SuperFI PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher 445 Scientific, Prague, Czech Republic). The mixture (final volume, 50 \u03bcl) contained 45 \u03bcL of 446 SuperMix, 2 \u03bcl of DNA template (fragment III) at 1 ng/\u03bcl. Assays were performed on a 447 Biometra TProfessional Standard Gradient thermocycler with the following conditions: 94 \u00b0C 448 for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 15 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, 68 \u00b0C for 5 min and a final 449 elongation step of 68 \u00b0C for 10 min. Size of the PCR products was verified by gel 450 electrophoresis and purified using an Amicon Ultra 0.5 ml kit (Millipore). 451 An equimolar mixture of these four DNA fragments was used for cell transfection. 452 DNA-lipid complex was prepared as follows: 12 \u03bcl of Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) 453 was diluted in 250 \u03bcL Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies) and then mixed with a master 454 solution of DNA which contained 3 \u03bcg of DNA and 6 \u03bcl of P3000 reagent diluted in 250 \u03bcL 455 Opti-MEM medium. After 45-min incubation at room temperature BHK-21 cells were 456 transfected, as described previously (Aubry et al., 2015) and incubated for 5-7 days. Cell 457 supernatant media were then harvested and serially passaged twice in fresh BHK-21 culture. 458 459 Growth kinetics, dose-response studies and viral inhibition assays 460 To evaluate growth kinetics of drug-resistant TBEV mutants, PS cell monolayers 461 incubated for 24 h in 96-well plates were treated with 200 \u03bcl of medium containing 462 Galidesivir at concentrations of 25 \u03bcM (compound-treated cells) or 0.5% (v/v) DMSO (mock-463 treated cells) and simultaneously infected with TBEV; the MOI of 0.1 was used for all TBEV 464 mutant/wild-type tested. The medium was collected from the wells daily at days 1 to 7 p.i. 465 (three wells per interval); viral titres (expressed as PFU/mL) were determined by plaque 466 assay as described previously (De Madrid and Porterfield, 1969; Eyer et al., 2015) and used 467 to construct TBEV growth curves. 468 For dose-response studies, 200 \u00b5l of fresh medium containing Galidesivir at TBEV at an MOI of 0.1 and incubated for 3-4 days p.i. Then, the medium was collected from 471 the wells and the viral titres were determined by plaque assay. The obtained viral titre 472 values were used for the construction of TBEV dose-response/inhibition curves and for 473 estimation of the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of the drug. 474 To measure the sensitivity/resistance of the obtained TBEV mutants to Galidesivir 475 and several structurally unrelated nucleoside analogues in cell culture by viral titre inhibition 476 assay, confluent PS cell monolayers cultured for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C in 96-well plates were treated 477 with Galidesivir, 7-deaza-2\u00b4-C-methyladenosine, 2\u00b4-C-methyladenosine, or 4\u00b4-azido-478 aracytidine (RO-9187) at concentrations of 25 or 50 \u03bcM and simultaneously infected with 479 TBEV at an MOI of 0.1 (3 wells per compound). As a mock-treated control, DMSO was added 480 to virus-and mock-infected cells at a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v). The formation of 481 cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored visually using the Olympus BX-5 microscope to yield 482 70%-90% CPE in virus-infected cultures and viral titres were determined by plaque assays 483 from cell culture supernatants. 484 The unbound, apo-form of the TBEV RdRp used in this study is a homology-based 502 predicted structure previously prepared for simulations in other published studies (Vald\u00e9s et 503 al., 2016, 2017). The stochastic molecular simulations were conducted using the online 504 software, Protein Energy Landscape Exploration (PELE) that employs a Metropolis Monte 505 Carlo algorithm which accepts or rejects a protein-ligand conformation based on its 506 enthalpy. The PELE method and its applications are thoroughly explained online 507 (https://pele.bsc.es/) and elsewhere (Madadkar-Sobhani et al., 2013; Borrelli et al., 2005) 508 and therefore are briefly described here. The PELE software comprises three steps: a local 509 protein and ligand perturbation, amino acid sidechain sampling, and a global minimization. 510 These steps are repeated for a few thousand iterations resulting in a trajectory of a ligand 511 (i.e., Galidesivir) approaching the active site of the target protein (i.e., TBEV RdRp). The first 512 25 snapshots were removed from the final trajectories prior to analysis since the stochastic 513 simulations reached a relatively stable total enthalpy. Geometric and enthalpy 514 measurements recoded via the PELE script were used for data analysis. The stochastic 515 migration simulations were performed in triplicates, each with separate positioning of 516 Galidesivir 20 \u00c5 ~ 25 \u00c5 away from the centre of mass (COM) within the TBEV", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "Proposed positioning of Galidesivir and its migration in the wild type and mutant Fig 5.
