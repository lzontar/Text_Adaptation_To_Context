The imine formed from 2 and 3 was expected to be the active species. To test this hypothesis, at first the reduced amination product (4, Scheme 1) was synthesized. Tested in the HPLC assay described by Tan et al., [11] 4 displayed a K I value of 50.3 mm. Comparison of the inhibitory activity of 4 with that of reduced amide 5 and those of the peptides Ac-DSFDQ-OH, DSFDQ-OH, and Ac-DSFDQ-NH 2 , which all were completely inactive at 500 mm, supported the directing effect of peptide aldehyde 2 and the binding of fragment 3 to the S1' site. The lower inhibition by 4 compared to peptide aldehyde 2 can be attributed to the absence of the electrophilic carbonyl group interacting favorably with the activesite cysteine residue of SARS-CoV M pro . Furthermore, the complexes of peptide aldehyde 2 and of the imine formed with fragment 3 with SARS-CoV main protease were Communications modeled, which suggested a possible binding mode of fragment 3 ( Figure 2 ). Additional evidence for the binding of fragment 3 in the S1' pocket was provided by the synthesis and testing of aldehydes and 2-ketoaldehydes 6-9, which are all electrophilic derivatives of 3 (Scheme 1). Compounds 6-9 were designed with an electrophilic group to interact with the active site cysteine of the protease. While 6 and 7 were obtained by oxidation of the respective alcohols, the 2ketoaldehydes 8 and 9 were prepared by polymer-supported C-acylation, decarboxylation, and oxidative cleavage from a phosphane resin. [12] Indeed all designed mono-and biselectrophiles were active inhibitors of SARS-CoV M pro (Scheme 1). Inhibitors 7 and 9, which are expected to position the active fragment in the same place relative to the cysteine residue as in the initial ligation product, were more potent inhibitors than compounds 6 and 8. Benzaldehyde (10), used as a control, was completely inactive, again indicating that the fragments detected by DLS bind specifically to the S1' pocket of SARS-CoV M pro .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 566, "end": 570, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1845, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1301, "end": 1309, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "To obtain an entirely non-peptidic inhibitor of SARS-CoV M pro targeting both the S1' and S1 pockets, the dynamic ligation screening was conducted iteratively in a \"reverted\" mode ( Table 2 ). Instead of peptide aldehyde 2, which binds to the S side of the binding cleft, 2-ketoaldehyde 9, which presumably binds to the S' side, was employed as a directing probe. For this experiment, 110 amines selected by diversity analysis were screened. Compound 9 was incubated with one amine per well, the protease, and the fluorogenic substrate Ac-TSAVLQ-AMCA (1) . In this second screen, three fragments were identified which were active in the presence of the directing probe 9 ( Table 2 ). The most active was 11, which was selected for verification of the inhibitor binding by chemical synthesis. Using the 2-ketoaldehydes 8 and 9 for the covalent linking appeared to be advantageous, as the aldehyde could undergo reductive amination while the 2-keto functionality remained intact for interaction with cysteine 145. Amine 11 was prepared as reported, [13] employed for reductive amination of 2-ketoaldehyde 9 with trichlorosilane as reducing agent, [14] and yielded successfully 2-aminoketone 12 as the Scheme 1.

Thus, we can conclude that dynamic ligation screening (DLS) enables the sensitized and site-directed detection of low-affinity fragments with inhibition constants in the millimolar range that are difficult or impossible to detect with previous dynamic strategies and conventional fragment-based methods. The method was operated in high-throughput format, and only very small amounts of protein were used by exploiting the amplification effect of the enzyme-catalyzed detection. No additional equipment was required besides a standard microtiter plate reader. Most importantly, DLS was operated iteratively in an evolutionary process and succeeded in the transformation of a moderately active peptidic inhibitor to an entirely non-peptidic inhibitor with an inhibition constant in the low micromolar range.
