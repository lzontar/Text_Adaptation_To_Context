For a multitude of reasons, however, EHR data are still complex and have ample quality issues, which make it difficult to leverage these data to address pressing health issues, especially during pandemics such as COVID-19, when rapid responses are needed. In this paper, we propose a transitive sequential pattern mining algorithm for exploiting the temporal information in the EHRs that are distorted by layers of administrative and healthcare system processes. Perhaps more importantly, we propose a machine learning (ML) pipeline that is capable of engineering predictive features without the need for expert involvement to model diseases and health outcomes.

EHRs contain important temporal information that provide an opportunity for discovering new insights about disease progression and treatment trajectories. However, EHR observations reflect a complex set of processes that thwart their seamless translation into actionable knowledge. Namely, the raw EHR records may not be direct indicators of patients' ''true'' health states at different time points, but rather reflect the clinical processes (e.g., policies and workflows of the provider and payor), the patients' interactions with the system, and the recording processes. [1] [2] [3] Biomedical researchers increasingly apply conventional association studies to EHR data, yet the temporality of these data have not been fully exploited by current methods. 1, 4 The temporal properties of EHR data signify the complexities of the healthcare processes. This makes incorporating temporal information into common temporal analysis techniques challenging. 5 The challenge is twofold. First, EHR observations are recorded asynchronously across time (i.e., measured at different times and irregularly), which provide foundational challenges for directly applying common temporal analysis methods. [6] [7] [8] [9] Second, translating the temporal nature of discrete EHR data into useful data representations (or features) for standard machine learning (ML) algorithms is challenging. 10, 11 This is a critical gap.
