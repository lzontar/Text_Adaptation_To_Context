The clinical features of COVID-19 are heterogeneous and subtle in many cases. They may easily be overlooked in the case of other acute diseases. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19 as SARS-CoV-2 is able to enter gastrointestinal epithelial cells. However, these complaints can also be caused by a COVID-19-independent concomitant abdominal pathology. Therefore, patients with acute abdominal pain and fever need to be assessed very thoroughly.

Furthermore, all patients are triaged according to the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) [1] [2] [3] . Assessment is done by a specially trained triage nurse under the supervision of a physician. These initial items include having had contact with a person with COVID-19 within the last 14 days, a body temperature of more than 37.5 \u00b0 C or intake of antipyretics within the last 6 h, respiratory symptoms such as cough or dyspnea, and a new absence of olfaction. If 1 item (or more) is positive or a patient cannot be assessed for all items (e.g., due to dementia or loss of consciousness), he/she is first treated at the ID-ED.

Operations are conducted in a specifically designated COVID-19 operating room with ventilation-technical equipment facilitating a negative air pressure. The intraoperative safety measures are based on currently available recommendations (i.e., from the American College of Surgeons) and include FFP2 masks, safety glasses/face shields, double surgical gloves, a water-proof gown, shoe covers, performing an open surgical procedure, maximum reduction of aerosols (e.g., avoiding electrocautery and high-speed tools, double aspiration) [5] [6] [7] .

Our presented case and its management show that the assessment of patients with an acute abdomen is challenging due to overlapping of typical and atypical symptoms as well as laboratory and radiologic findings, depending on the disease stage. Furthermore, high SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations and sgRNA-containing cells could be detected in the stool of infected patients [2, 8] , indicating active replication in the gastrointestinal tract in analogy with SARS-CoV, which was shown to be excreted in stool, from which it could be isolated.
