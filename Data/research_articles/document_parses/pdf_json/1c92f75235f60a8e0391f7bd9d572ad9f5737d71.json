She tested positive for coronavirus. As she was feeling well, self-isolation at home was recommended. Four days later she presented with diarrhea, ageusia and anosmia. During the following days she started feeling better but with persistent dry cough, ageusia and anosmia. She only took paracetamol the first 4 days and did not take any other drugs. Thirteen days after being tested (10 days after last dose of paracetamol), the patient started noticing pruritic lesions on both heels and sent us some photos. Confluent erythematous-yellowish papules were observed in both heels (Fig. 1a-b) , without any lesions on the rest of the skin. She denied wearing tight socks, shoes or any local pressure that could explain the distribution of the lesions. A treatment with local corticosteroids was advised. Despite this treatment, three days later, the lesions persisted and became erythematous plaques that were both hardened and pruritic (Fig. 2a-b) . At this point, urticaria, urticarial vasculitis, idiopathic plantar hidradenitis and neutrophilic dermatosis were considered within the differential diagnosis.",

The case we report is a mild COVID-19 disease case with no history of drug intake for the last 10 days. The observed skin manifestations could be related with the COVID-19 viral infection or with the immune response. We think it is important to report cutaneous manifestations of this new infection that may help us to pay attention, better diagnose and understand the disease.",
