Their primary results relied on a fixed level of intensity of regime switching. Instead of estimating the level of intensity jointly with other parameters in their model, they calibrated the level of intensity so that the U.S. economy spends about 20% of time in a recessionary regime. In Ramey and Zubairy (2018) , the baseline results assume that the U.S. economy is in a slack state if the unemployment rate is above 6.5%.

INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "To be consistent with the empirical literature, we build on Ramey and Zubairy (2018) : we use their dataset and follow their methodology closely. Our main departure from the recent empirical literature is that we split the sample in a data-dependent way so that the choice of threshold level is determined endogenously. It turns out that the endogenized threshold level of the unemployment rate is estimated at 11.97%, which is much higher than 6.5% adopted in Ramey and Zubairy (2018) . Using this new threshold level combined with the same data and specifications as in Ramey and Zubairy (2018) , we find that the estimated fiscal multipliers are significantly different between the two states and above unity for the high unemployment state. Specifically, if the threshold level is 6.5%, the estimates of 2-year integral multipliers are around 0.6 regardless of the state of the economy. However, if the threshold level is 11.97%, the estimates are 1.58 for the high employment state and 0.55 for the low employment state, respectively. If we look at observations used in estimation, there is no period after World War II with the unemployment rate higher than 11.97%. In fact, there is only one timespan of severe slack periods in 1930s. In other words, the period of the Great Depression is isolated from other periods, as an outcome of our estimation procedure. Therefore, our estimation results suggest that (1) the fiscal multiplier can be larger than unity if the slackness of the economy is very severe and that (2) the post-World War II period does not include the severe slack state and thus, our estimates for the high unemployment state are not applicable to moderate recessions in the post-WWII period. However, after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 14.7% in April 2020. 1 Therefore, the estimation results in this paper shed light on the prospect of the fiscal policy in response to the current economic shocks. We also examine the possibility of timevarying regimes of slackness by including a time dummy for the post-WWII period and find that our empirical results are robust under this more flexible framework.
