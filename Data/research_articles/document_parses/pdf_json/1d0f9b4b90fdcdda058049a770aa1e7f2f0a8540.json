            "text": "After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in March, 2020, surgical departments throughout the United States were required to cancel all elective surgery by executive order. The time sensitivity and necessity of nonemergent surgery was deferred to the local level. Algorithms were developed to triage emergent, urgent, and elective cases in order to divert limited resources to the care of COVID-19 patients. [1] [2] [3] When hospital systems in the New York and Detroit Metropolitan Areas experienced \"black level\" surges of COVID-19 patients, all except for the most emergent cases were put on indefinite hold. 1 By late April 2020, the number of new COVID-19 cases being admitted daily plateaued in these 2 regions and hospitals started planning for the recovery effort. This included addressing all nonemergent surgery that had been postponed, along with the normal inflow of new surgical cases. Meanwhile, as the COVID-19 crisis persisted, albeit at a lower level, this continued to severely limit resources. Not surprisingly, there were discussions regarding the appropriate prioritization and timing of neurosurgical cases.",
