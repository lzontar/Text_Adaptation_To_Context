Although it may be counter-intuitive that a newly identified virus that can infect anyone would rapidly manifest pronounced racial disparities, a consistent pattern has been reported across multiple states, showing that black Americans comprise a disproportionately greater number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other Americans [2] [3] [4] For instance, in New York City, the current epicenter of the US epidemic, COVID-19 deaths disproportionately affect black Americans (22% of population and 28% of deaths) and in the rest of the state (9% of the population and 18% of deaths). 5 Such disparities are also evident within individual counties, such as in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin where black residents comprise 26% of the population yet account for 73% of COVID-19 deaths; 6 and in Dougherty County, GA (69% black) where 81% of 38 deaths were black. 7 Although the CDC reports cumulative COVID-19 data reported by state health departments, 78% of those data were missing race/ethnicity disaggregations as of April 15, 2020. 8 Incomplete reporting of race remains common. One state's department of health reported 20.5% of COVID-19 cases among blacks, 15.3% among whites, 1.5% other, yet nearly two-thirds (62.7%) were racial/ethnic category unknown. 9 Another disaggregated their data, but reported that three quarters (74%) of the cases were of unknown race or ethnicity. 10 05/02/20 3 A more thorough understanding of the impact of COVID-19 by race/ethnicity will remain unavailable until more states report disaggregated data and until additional work is conducted to strengthen the completeness of race/ethnicity data. In the meantime, it is possible to use ecological analyses with data at the county level to assess determinants of risk among black Americans to inform immediate policy actions.

However, all five strata for lower urbanization still have 35%-50% of the percent black residents observed in the most urban counties. Within disproportionately black counties, is the impact of COVID-19 homogenous, or do relatively more black and less black areas within a given county have differential impact? Even within heavily impacted urban areas, predominantly black neighborhoods have higher rates of COVID-19 disease and death. For example, in Prince George's County, Maryland, white suburbs are relatively unimpacted, while predominantly black suburbs are heavily impacted. 47 Third, do excess COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths occur among black people in more rural counties, or in counties that experienced outbreaks later in the epidemic? The risk of COVID-19 diagnoses for counties with more black residents is consistent across levels of urbanicity. The risk of COVID-19-related death for disproportionately black counties is significantly higher only in small metro and rural areas. Further, where rural transmission has been significant, it has been in disproportionately black counties. 48, 49 Counties like Dougherty County Georgia experienced intense outbreaks among black Georgians a month later than the early wave of infections in large urban areas. In sum, the alignment of individuallevel and neighborhood data within urban centers and the county-level data presented here documenting disproportionate burden among black people suggests that the ecologic analyses presented here are not attributable to structural confounding, and may hold true at the individual level in at least some cases.

Importantly, COVID-19 transmission dynamics are complex and evolving and the inferences may evolve with additional data. We posit that these analyses of disproportionate burden among black people are likely conservative because black Americans are less likely to have health insurance and evidence is emerging across the country that black people with symptoms for COVID-19 are less likely than other groups to be tested for the virus. Ultimately, these analyses draw strength from highlighting specific counties at elevated risk for COVID-19 and identifying more locations with disparate COVID-19 outcomes among black Americans than those profiled in the media including Dougherty County, GA; St John the Baptist Parish, LA; Cook County, IL; Milwaukee County, WI; Queens County, NY. Our paper focuses on black Americans, but they are not the only population of interest or at potentially elevated risk. Additional analyses exploring disparities in COVID-19 among Latino, Native American and other populations is critical as the results of inequitable outcomes are representative of past respiratory pathogens including H1N1 47 in the U.S. and thus likely indicative of potentially future waves of COVID-19 and other rapidly emerging respiratory", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Rates", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "COVID-19 Cases Per 100,000 (adjusted per day since detection) by Increasing Proportion of Black Residents Across US Counties as of April 13, 2020 (Interactive version of figure available at ehedev.amfar.org/bubble_plot_cases.html)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "include percent black or white, percent over 65 years old, percent uninsured, percent unemployed and household occupancy per room. b'", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "Estimated ' includes diabetes diagnoses, heart disease deaths, cerebrovascular and hypertension deaths, and HIV diagnoses b 'Social/environmental' includes urbanicity (1=urban, 6=rural), PM2.5 (fine particulate matter in the air), social distancing score is a grade ('A'=1, 'B'=2, 'C'=3, 'D'=4, 'F'=5) c 'Days since first case' is temporality variable based upon the following citation: Geographic Differences in COVID-19 Cases, d Deaths, and Incidence -United States, February 12-April 7, 2020.
