Noroviruses, coronaviruses and HAV were not primary concerns during the development of the pathogen standards governing biosolids, but have since been documented as causative agents of serious and highly communicable illnesses. The recent surge in clinical cases caused by these enteric viruses emphasizes the need to determine whether the current indicator, EVs, can accurately predict their presence in biosolids and persistence during treatment (Wang et al. 2005; Colomba et al. 2006; Fiaccadori et al. 2006) . HAV, the most common cause of infectious hepatitis in the world, infects approx. 140 000 people in the US each year with an annual cost of between $332 and $580 million (Berge et al. 2000 ). HAV demonstrates a high level of resistance to inactivation by chemicals (Li et al. 2002) , heat (Sobsey et al. 1986 ) and has survived for longer periods of time than EVs in experimentally contaminated freshwater, seawater, wastewater and soils (Sobsey et al. 1988) . The ubiquity of HAV in biosolids has not been well characterized as wild-type virus rarely exhibits cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell culture and replicates slowly (Graff et al. 1993) making it unlikely to be detected by the CFR part 503 method (EPA 2003) .

EVs, specifically polioviruses, were ideal indicators for the presence of enteric viruses when the CFR Part 503 regulations were first promulgated in 1993, especially those viruses not easily detected or quantified by available methods. Advancements in environmental virology have made it possible to more readily detect enteric viruses in the environment as well as evaluate their ubiquity and levels of resistance to traditional treatment methodologies. Numerous studies support the hypothesis that EVs are no longer the most ubiquitous viruses in the various matrices that they were once thought to be (Irving and Smith 1981; Havelaar et al. 1993; Sedmak et al. 2003) , nor are EVs the most difficult to inactivate (Ward and Ashley 1978; Sobsey et al. 1986; Tree et al. 2003) . Alternatively, phages such as MS2 are present at higher concentrations in wastewater residuals than anthropogenic viruses (Calci et al. 1998) , detected by cost-efficient and rapid assays and have been found less susceptible to chemical inactivation than EVs (Tree et al. 2003) . This study sought to compare the inactivation rates of MS2, T1 L and HM-175, during alkaline stabilization of wastewater residues and evaluate the potential of MS2 to serve as an indicator for the persistence of these enteric viruses in treated biosolids. Alkaline stabilization can be used to generate class B biosolids by maintaining wastewater solids at a pH of 12 for 2 h without strict time or temperature regulations that are required to achieve class A standards (EPA 2000a). Pathogen inactivation under these conditions comes from the hydroxide alkalinity of the liming material added with further reduction in contaminants via flocculation or flotation (Grabow et al. 1978) . Previous studies have shown that alkaline stabilization performed under class B conditions for 24 h at 4 and 28\u00b0C significantly reduces the level of seeded poliovirus (Sattar et al. 1976 ), adenovirus, rotavirus and MS2 ). Our findings, utilizing a bench scale model, also demonstrate that 24 h of alkaline stabilization is an effective treatment for the reduction of MS2, as well as T1 L and HM-175 (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 997, "end": 1020, "text": "(Irving and Smith 1981;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1042, "text": "Havelaar et al. 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1062, "text": "Sedmak et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1132, "text": "(Ward and Ashley 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1152, "text": "Sobsey et al. 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1170, "text": "Tree et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1314, "text": "(Calci et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1450, "text": "(Tree et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2135, "text": "(Grabow et al. 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2305, "end": 2324, "text": "(Sattar et al. 1976", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2538, "end": 2547, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Previous studies by Hansen et al.

These results suggest that MS2 could serve as an indicator for the presence of T1 L and HM-175 following alkaline stabilization performed within enclosed facilities at moderate temperatures. Alternatively, it is questionable whether MS2 is inactivated similarly to HM-175 at 4\u00b0C as there was large variation during the three trials leading to a significant difference in their inactivation at 0AE1 and 2 h. The variation between trials may have been the result of inadequate pH maintenance or phage-specific anti-viral components within the sludge affecting both the test and the control samples.
