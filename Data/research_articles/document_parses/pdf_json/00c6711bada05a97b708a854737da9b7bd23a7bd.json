In particular, the growth rate of the infection has been fitted as an exponential decay, as compared to a linear decay, reported previously. The model has been validated with the data of China and South Korea, where the pandemic is nearing to its end. The data of Italy, Germany, Spain, and Sweden show that the peak of the infection has reached i.e. a time when the new infections will start to decrease as compared to the previous day. The model predicts the approximate number of total infections at the end of the outbreak. The model prediction of the USA, and Brazil show that the peak will reach in the next two-three weeks. The total number of infections in the USA is estimated to be around 4 million by the model. The reported data of India show the start of disease evolution, with a large initial scatter in the growth rate.

A simple predictive model in this context can help to devise or modify policies by the governments while designing the mitigation measures and to judiciously use the healthcare infrastructure. While there are several predictive models reported previously (e.g. Refs. [1, 2, 3] ), the present modeling effort is to develop a data-driven, extrapolation model. A previous model used a linear fit to the growth rate of the inflection, that could not predict the data accurately [1] . Here we build upon the model in Ref.

The fitting results in section 3 show that the exponential fit works well with the given data, as compared to a linear fit. Using the fit obtained, we extrapolate number of infections which will occur in future for t > t p using the fitted value of \u03bb t i . The initial value of this extrapolation is taken as N P . This allow us to predict the time of the peak of infections i.e. after this time, the daily infections will start to reduce. The total number of infections are also predicted, with the same extrapolation. The peak time is obtained by plotting N t i \u2212 N t i\u22121 against time and the end of the outbreak is considered when \u03bb t i \u2264 0.01 i.e. the rise in the total number of infections falls below 1%.
