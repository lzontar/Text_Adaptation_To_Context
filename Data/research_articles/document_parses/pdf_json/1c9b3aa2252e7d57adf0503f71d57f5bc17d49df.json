The urgent need to control the disease, combined with the lack of specific and effective treatment modalities, call for the use of FDA-approved agents that have shown efficacy against similar pathogens. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin have all been successful in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The initial results of a number of clinical trials involving various protocols of administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine mostly point towards their beneficial effect. However, they may not be effective in cases with persistently high viremia, while results on ivermectin (another antiparasitic agent) are not yet available. Interestingly, azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic in combination with hydroxychloroquine, might yield clinical benefit as an adjunctive. The results of clinical trials point to the potential clinical efficacy of antivirals, especially remdesivir (GS-5734), lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir.

Soluble ACE2 would competitively compete for SARS-CoV attachment with receptors present on cell surfaces, preventing virion invasion of pneumocytes. In vitro studies support the above assumptions -soluble ACE2 limited the proliferation of SARS-CoV on the Vero-E6 cell line [58, 59] . In in vitro tests, ACE2 combined with the Fc fragment of the antibody neutralized the virus [60] . The method described is currently not feasible, with numerous obstacles that need to be removed before this therapy can enter human testing phase. The development of bioinformatics sparks hope that the analysis of protein data banks will allow for faster discovery of a receptor for which SARS-CoV-2 proteins will be a high-affinity ligand [61] . Currently, studies on an animal model are not being carried out, however, transgenic mice expressing the human form of ACE2 are achievable and it is likely a matter of time before research in this model begins [41] .",

This drug is theoretically capable of preventing viral infection of the host cell. Thus, it should be considered as a potential therapeutic agent for COVID-19 infection [60] . Camostat mesylate is approved in Japan for the treatment of pancreatitis. During a study on SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a patient, camostat mesylate managed to prevent the virus from entering lung cells [107] and lung epithelial cells (Fig. 3 ) [113] . In the study, 17 patients were given 10 mg meplazumab intravenously on day 1, 2 and 5, while 11 patients served as the control group. Patients treated with meplazumab, were discharged significantly faster and the severity of the disease was decreased. The time to negative viral load was also reduced. No side effects were noted during the study. Due to the small group, this drug requires further research, but the initial results are promising [114] .",

On the other hand, SARS-CoV-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [132] . UPR is involved in regulation of autophagy and in the cellular secretome [136, 137] . Therefore, simultaneous targeting of autophagy/UPR pathway using FDA-approved compounds including chloroquine, statins, or drugs that are on their Phase-I or Phase-II clinical trials (MKC8866 to target IRE1 RNase activity) and antiviral therapy regimens could be an ideal strategy to control COVID-19 pandemic and help high risk patients to increase survival.

The clinical stage of four patients was classified as critical (19%). All patients received standard of care, including lopinavir and methylprednisolone, as well as tocilizumab at a dose of 400 mg intravenously either in one or two doses. Eighteen patients (85.7%) received tocilizumab once, and three patients (14.3%) received tocilizumab twice, with the second dose being administered due to recurrent fever within 12 hours of first administration. After receiving tocilizumab, all patients experienced fever resolution within 24 hours, with reported improvement of clinical symptoms. In 15 out of 20 patients (75%), there was a statistically significant decrease in oxygen demand from the fifth day after receiving tocilizumab. Additionally, in 19 patients (90.5%), CT scan showed resolution of radiological abnormalities and mean CRP levels markedly decreased on day 5. None of the patients died during the course of the study. Nineteen patients (90.5%) survived until discharge, and 2 remained in the hospital until the end of the follow-up period. During the clinical trial period, no significant adverse reactions related to tocilizumab treated were reported [110]. In a retrospective cohort study on 51 COVID-19 patients, individuals with lung infiltrates and elevated inflammatory markers received a single dose of tocilizumab, if no J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f contraindications were present. Additionally, systemic steroid, HCQ, and azithromycin were concomitantly used for the majority of patients. During the course of the study, 28 patients (55%) received tocilizumab and 23 (45%) did not receive. Tocilizumab cohort required more invasive ventilation (68% vs 22%) at baseline, as well as during the entire time of hospitalization (75% vs 48%). The median duration of vasopressor support and invasive mechanical ventilation in tocilizumab vs no tocilizumab cohorts was 2 days (IQR: 1.75 -4.25 days) vs 5 days (IQR: 4 -8 days), p = 0.039. Similar rates of hospital-acquired infections occurred in both cohorts. The authors concluded that tocilizumab administration was followed by rapid clinical improvement of COVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS [111]. Meplazumab H.
