The focus on both effective service coverage as well as financial risk protection under UHC implies that how countries finance their health systems matters (Kutzin, 2012) . Financing for health in most low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is dominated by high levels of out-of-pocket (OOP) spending, an inefficient and inequitable modality which contributes to foregone care among vulnerable populations and puts them at risk of impoverishment from illness-related catastrophic expenditures. Low levels of government revenue generation and low priority for health in government budgets are two key factors contributing to low levels of public spending for health, which, in turn, is one of the primary reasons behind high levels of OOP spending in LMICs (World Bank, 2019) .

Reprioritization accounted for less than one-fifth of the change in public spending for health in LMICs, less than half of its contribution among HICs. Although some countries experienced consistently steady linear growth in both per capita GDP and per capita public spending for health, most showed large shifts in trends often with statistically-identifiable break points that occurred primarily in 2008, the year of the global financial crisis, following which average growth rates declined significantly (Table 3 ).

However, many countries including Madagascar, Brazil, Kenya, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and the United States, among others, changed trend patterns, sometimes significantly. For example, economic growth was negative in Brazil following 2014, with a per capita GDP landscape that can be characterized as a 'cliff'. During the period, the country also experienced a decline in the total public revenue share of GDP. However, reprioritization efforts combined with a deficit-fueled rise in total public spending protected levels of per capita public spending for health from declining thus leading to a 'plateau' landscape. Indonesia was an 'accelerator' for per capita GDP but a 'steep hill' for per capita public spending for health, primarily because priority for health increased in recent years especially after 2014 when a new administration took office. The trend in Madagascar changed from being a 'slippery slope' for economic growth to a 'steep valley' for per capita public spending on health: economic growth was relatively stagnant from 2000 to 2017 leading to an almost flat landscape for per capita GDP.

Such corrective action by both a rise in total public spending and a higher priority for health help mitigate the adverse impacts of a decline or volatility in per capita GDP. Thus while country context matters, the importance of economic growth for public spending on health underscores the critical need to situate, integrate, leverage, and proactively manage health financing reforms within a country's overall macro-fiscal context and to emphasize the need for counter-cyclical policies to support per capita public spending for health during economic downturns. On the flip side, the relatively marginal role of changes in priority for increasing public spending for health is notable, especially given how much effort and advocacy has focused on this aspect (African Union, 2001; Tandon et al., 2014) . These lessons are now even more critical given the current global COVID-19 pandemic. Based on projections by the IMF (2020), the current crisis is expected to result in greater declines in economic growth than the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. The impact on public financing for health will depend on the extent to which expansionary fiscal policies and health reprioritization occurs.
