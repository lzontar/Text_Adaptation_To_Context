Natural influenza virus infection and current influenza vaccines elicit antibodies that block binding of the head of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein to its cell surface receptor, but the virus readily evades these antibodies by mutations in the antibody-binding region ( Figure 1 ). 5 In contrast, several groups have recently identified conserved regions in the stem domain of HA that elicit rare human neutralizing antibodies that can protect against multiple influenza HA subtypes. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] These human monoclonal antibodies are candidate therapeutics for influenza, but because of the complexity of the three-dimensional binding sites of the monoclonal antibod-ies on the stem region of HA, it is extremely difficult to design an immunogen to mimic these epitopes to create immunogens that will elicit these neutralizing antibodies.",

Recently, results suggest that HA2-based immunogens can provide cross protection against several strains within a subtype. 14, 15 However, these vaccines are still large in size and require C-terminal trimerization motifs connected by flexible linkers to properly fold the trimeric structure of the headless stem domain. 15 It still remains to be shown that cross-reactive protection against many different subtypes can be achieved with stem domain constructs by in vivo challenge experiments in animals with heterologous subtypes. Existing influenza vaccines display limited efficacy for several reasons. 16 The head region of HA rapidly mutates and antibodies in the human population to previous influenza strains select for antigenic variants so that new vaccine strains that target these variants must be developed every year, based on predictions of viral strains that may circulate the next winter. 17 Errors in ).

H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A are continually undergoing immune selection (antigenic drift) in humans, so that antibody-resistant strains continue to emerge and cause new human pandemics. Subtypes H5, H7, and H9 are recognized by the World Health Organization as \"potential pandemic viruses\" and humans have no pre-existing immunity to these subtypes. 18 Avian H5N1 virus is highly pathogenic in humans with a mortality rate of 60% in humans, but fortunately there is not efficient human-to-human transmission. 19 Mutations in virus genes that alter antigenicity or host range, or increase virus virulence or transmissibility can occur spontaneously or can be genetically engineered to create biothreat strains. Therefore, a new strategy is needed for development of a universal influenza vaccine that could protect against all HA types and their antigenic variants, be manufactured quickly and inexpensively, be very stable with a long self-life, and induce long-lasting immunity. We are developing a novel synthetic peptide vaccine platform technology 20-22 that targets a-helical regions in proteins. We have chosen the stem region of Class 1 Viral Fusion Proteins such as Influenza A, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike glycoprotein and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike glycoprotein, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) F protein and Ebola glycoprotein 23, 24 because the a-helical regions in the stem are highly conserved and ideal candidates for vaccine development. The stem domains of the fusion glycoproteins of these diverse viruses share a common coiled-coil structure that must be triggered to undergo a massive conformational change in order to induce fusion of the virus envelope with host cell membranes and initiate virus infection. Blocking the conformational change in the stem region of the viral fusion protein with antibodies can prevent virus infection in vitro and in vivo. Thus, if one can elicit antibodies to functionally significant and/or highly conserved regions of these glycoproteins, the ability to provide a broadly protective vaccine is dramatically enhanced. Synthetic peptide vaccines have many advantages over traditional vaccines 25 if they can mimic the structure of the epitope found in the native protein target: (1) The peptide vaccine can be synthesized soon after virus emergence when the key regions of the viral immunogen fusion protein have been deduced from the viral nucleic acid sequence; (2) The peptide immunogen, in our case, is small containing a B-cell epitope of 28 amino acid residues in length and can be rapidly and inexpensively manufactured in very large quantities; (3) The synthesized peptide immunogen does not have to be purified away from cellular components or irrelevant viral proteins; (4) Traditional vaccines with intact proteins may contain additional epitopes that elicit undesired B-cell or T-cell responses, thus, there is improved safety for synthetic peptide vaccines; (5) The amino acid sequences of the coiled-coil regions of the viral fusion proteins are highly conserved among the many strains of emerging viruses, so that a single peptide immunogen has the potential to protect against multiple subtypes and host range mutants of an emerging virus, making the vaccine useful not only for humans, but also the animal reservoirs of the virus; (6) Our unique, conformation-stabilized templated, two-stranded synthetic peptide immunogens are highly stable to temperature, facilitating storage and stockpiling of the vaccine.",

            "text": "We are developing an extremely simple, innovative and robust technology to present a-helical epitopes from native proteins to the immune system such that the resulting conformationspecific antibodies bind to the native protein target. This procedure involves a process called templating where the helical sequence of interest is inserted into a parallel two-stranded ahelical coiled-coil and disulfide-bridged template which maintains the native helical conformation of the epitope, presents all the surface-exposed residues of the a-helix in the native protein and optimizes stability of the immunogen (Figure 2 ). To optimize the conformational stability of the immunogen, two synthetic peptides are stabilized in a two-stranded, coiled-coil configuration by substituting at each of the hydrophobic residues in the a and d positions of the native a-helix with isoleucine and leucine, respectively; and also linking the two templated peptides with a disulfide bond. It is well known that residues at the a and d positions define the hydrophobic interface between the helices and are critical for determining the oligomerization state and stability of coiled-coils. For example, the b-branched hydrophobic residues Ile and Val provide significantly greater stability to the coiled-coil than that of the similarly sized hydrophobic residue, Leu, when placed at position a, [26] [27] [28] whereas Leu appeared to provide more stability at position d. 28 Harbury et al. using synthetic analogs of GCN4, have shown that subtle changes in the type of hydrophobic core residues can result in selective formation of dimer, trimer and tetramer structures. 29 Hodges and co-workers carried out the complete biophysical characterization of a 38-residue model coiled-coil substituted by 20 different amino acid residues at position a and position d to determine their effect on protein stability. [30] [31] [32] Woolfson and Alber developed an algorithm to predict the oligomerization states of coiled-coils. 33 In the native a-helix the hydrophobic residues in positions a and d are buried while each of the b, c, e, f, and g residues are exposed on the surface. Similarly, in the two-stranded a-helical coiled-coil immunogen, each of the b, c, e, f, and g residues are also exposed on the surface and are identical to the corresponding residues displayed on the surface of the selected native ahelix in the stem domain (denoted by asterisks Figure 2 which creates two helical surfaces (blue), each which generate FIGURE 2 Templated a-Helical B-cell epitopes. The top panel shows the disulfide-bridged homo-two-stranded a-helical coiled-coil templated B-cell epitopes. The residue positions b, c, e, f, and g, which can be substituted with the native B-cell epitope, are indicated with an asterisk (*). The relative position of the * residues when in a two-stranded coiled-coil structure are shown in a cross-sectional view (lower right) and as a cartoon (lower left). In the cross-sectional view, the direction of the helices is into the page from the NH 2 to the COOH terminus, with the polypeptide chains parallel and in-register. Heptad positions are labeled a-g, with the prime indicating corresponding positions on the opposing helix. Arrows depict the hydrophobic interactions that occur between residues a and a 0 , d and d 0 . In the cartoon model, the white circles denote the b, c, e, f, and g positions exposed from the front view of the two-stranded coiled-coil. Diagram of templated peptide immunogens used in this study. Templated B-cell epitope is conjugated to the protein carrier, Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) via a linker consisting of a GG spacer, norleucine (for quantitation of moles of peptide per mole protein carrier) and an iodoacetyl group used to couple the peptide to SH groups on KLH. The disulfide bond at the C-terminus of the template is at an a position and is used to further stabilize the two-stranded a-helical coiled-coil. The RR residues at the Cterminus are used to enhance solubility of the immunogen, if required.",

The concentrations of HA proteins were provided by the supplier based on bicinchoninic acid colorimetric assay which determines the total protein concentration in solution. We wanted to verify the concentrations of the HA proteins by an alternative method since the degree of cross-reactivity to HA proteins is so dependent on concentration. Because we have the sequence of each HA protein we can carry out quantitative amino acid analysis to determine concentration. Both methods gave identical results. Amino acid analysis was performed according to the method described by Cohen and Michaud. 34 Briefly, 10 ml of each protein sample was aliquoted into glass tubes and lyophilized. To these tubes, 300 ml of 6M HCl w/0.1% phenol was added and the resulting solution was heated to 1108C for 48 h in order to hydrolyze the peptide bonds in the sample. Each sample tube was allowed to come to room temperature and then vacuum-dried to remove the HCl. Each sample was then re-suspended in 10 mM HCl and 20 ml of the sample was added to 60 ml of 0.2M sodium borate buffer, pH 8.8. To this mixture, 20 ml of 6-aminoquinoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate in acetonitrile was added to derivatize the amino acids present in the sample.

The downloaded sequences are available in the files fluH1n1.fasta, fluH5n1.fasta, and fluH3N2.fasta. To obtain a complete analysis of the variability in the full sets of applicable sequences, we wrote a short program in perl, called \"flucheck.pl\"; this will be made available on our laboratory web site (www.evolutionarygenomics.com). The aim of the analysis is to show the variability of short sequence fragments (kmers) by position. This is an alignment-free analysis, so the kmer positions are relative to one another. The program parameters can be adjusted through a control file, but the most relevant parameters are the minimum kmer count considered, and also the minimum transition count considered to obtain the relative positions. For the H1N1 and H3N2 datasets, these were set to 200, and for the H5N1 dataset (with far fewer sequences) they were set to 100. We note that the highest kmer counts vary along the sequences primarily because not all sequences are fulllength. The kmer length in these analyses is seven (i.e., a 7mer).",

We developed a novel computational technology called StableCoil to select the most stable amphipathic a-helices in any protein that have the potential to form stable coiled-coil structures. StableCoil is based entirely on experimentally determined physiochemical parameters. These parameters include stability coefficients derived from model coiled-coils 30-32 and a-helical propensity values derived from synthetic amphipathic a-helical peptides. 35 When considering a protein sequence of interest, there are seven possible reading frames in which a repeating heptad sequence (abcdefg) n can be found. StableCoil considers all seven possible reading frames and generates predicted stability data for each one. As a result, StableCoil avoids the need for screening large numbers of vaccine constructs by defining the reading frame(s) that contain predicted coiled-coil sequences and indicating which residues belong to each position in the heptad repeat (abcdefg) n . StableCoil rapidly identifies the region(s) of interest, thus reducing the number of B-cell epitopes that must be studied experimentally. StableCoil cannot predict which of these amphipathic ahelices will produce neutralizing antibodies but the importance of greatly reducing the number of helical epitopes as potential vaccine candidates cannot be over emphasized.",

These changes not only stabilize the resulting coiledcoil structure, but ensure that the coiled-coil is twostranded. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] A disulfide-bridge between the two strands can further stabilize the two-stranded coiled-coil immunogen. We previously demonstrated that the contribution of disulfide bonds to protein stability was dependent on whether the disul-fide bond was at position a or d in the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil. A disulfide bond at any position d (near-optimal geometry) makes the largest contribution to coiled-coil stability. 38 The only a position that contributes significantly to coiledcoil stability is a disulfide bond inserted at the N-terminal where the increase in stability is similar to a d position at the C- terminal end of the coiled-coil. 38 We also showed that the hydrophobic interactions at position a and d are less important at the ends of coiled-coil and the ends of coiled-coil are more flexible. 27 Thus, a disulfide-bond at the ends of coiled-coil prevents end-fraying, stabilizes the coiled-coil structure and the helical conformation at the ends of the two-stranded coiled-coil better mimicking the helical-structure of the native protein.",

Region 6P is slightly more variable than 5P with 3 major sequences in H3 with a frequency of occurrence at 9019; 2157; and 1,307 representing 88% of occurrences. For H5 in the 6P region, one sequence (3994) represented 86% of occurrences. For H1 in the 6P region, three sequences represented 94% of all occurrences (10,579; 3682; and 2809). The H1 sequences have remained highly conserved from 1918 (Spanish flu pandemic) to present with very subtle substitutions of conserved residues (e.g., M/I, L/I, V/I, F/Y, and R/K). The H5 sequences are essentially identical from 1959 to present. Similarly, the H3 sequences are extremely conserved since 1968 to present and the major changes observed are K to R or R to K substitutions. Based on this sequence information, it is easy to understand antibody cross-reactivity from a single peptide immunogen. Because these helices are involved in the major conformational change necessary for membrane fusion and virus entry it is clear why the 5P and 6P sequence remains so highly conserved over time. The existing trivalent vaccine consists of three HA proteins, two from influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and one from influenza B. Antigenic variants of these three proteins have been in global circulation since 1977. It is our goal to select the best sequence from this region that provides an immune response in humans where the antibodies protect against all viral strains from Group 1 and Group 2.",

The template was designed for maximum stability by creating a hydrophobic core consisting of Ile at position a and Leu at position d and an interchain disulfide-bridge at position a at the end of the coiled-coil. These changes also lock the immunogen into a two-stranded coiled-coil structure. It is interesting that the a-helices on the two-stranded structure generate antibodies that bind to the a-helices in the native hemagglutinin three-stranded coiled-coil in the stem domain. Our design greatly simplifies the immunogen structure. This technology leaves five out of every seven residues surfaceexposed and mimics the native amphipathic a-helix in the native protein.
