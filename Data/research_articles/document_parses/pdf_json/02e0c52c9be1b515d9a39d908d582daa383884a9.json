The underlying ring has always to be a countable dense subring of the real numbers and additions and comparisons and multiplications with constants need to be automatic. It is shown that the ring can be selected such that equilateral triangles can be represented and rotations by 30 \u2022 are possible, while the standard representation of the b-adic rationals does not allow this.",

A structure, say the ordered semigroup of natural numbers (N, \u2022, \u2264) is then automatic iff there is an isomorphic structure (A, \u2022, \u2264) where A is regular and \u2022, \u2264, = are automatic in the following sense: A finite automaton reads all tuples of possible inputs and outputs with the same speed in a synchronised way and accepts these tuples which are valid tuples in the relations \u2264 and = or which are valid combinations (x, y, z) with x \u2022 y = z in the case of the semigroup operation (function) \u2022. For this, one assumes that the inputs and outputs of relations and functions are aligned with each other, like decimal numbers in addition, and for this alignment -which has to be the same for all operations -one fills the gaps with a special character. So words are functions with some domain {\u2212m, \u2212m + 1, . . . , n \u2212 1, n} and some fixed range \u03a3 and the finite automaton reads, when processing a pair (x, y) of inputs, in each round the symbols (x(k), y(k)) where the special symbol # / \u2208 \u03a3 replaces x(k) or y(k) in the case that these are not defined. See Example 3 below for an example of a finite automaton checking whether x + y = z for numbers x, y, z; here a finite automaton computes a function by checking whether the output matches the inputs. Automatic functions are characterised as those computed by a position-faithful one-tape Turing machine in linear time [3] .",

They furthermore wanted that the representatives of the group elements are given as words over the generators, leading to more meaningful representatives than arbitrary strings. Their concept of automatic groups led, for finitely generated groups, to a larger class of groups, though, by definition, of course it does not include groups which require infinitely many generators; groups with infinitely many generators, to some extent, were covered in the notion of automaticity by Hodgson, Khoussainov and Nerode. Nies, Oliver and Thomas provide in several papers [14, 15] results which contrast and compare these two notions of automaticity and give an overview on results for groups which are automatic in the sense of Hodgson, Khoussainov and Nerode.",

Here the convention is to put the automatic domains, functions and relations before a semicolon and the semiautomatic relations after the semicolon. The present work will focus more on structures like rings than groups, although the field of automatic and semiautomatic structures has a strong group theoretic component. The construction of these semiautomatic rings is similar to that of Nies and Semukhin [13] for a presentation of Z 2 where no 1-dimensional subgroup is a regular subset.",

However, one gets one additional relation: One can recognise whether two digits a \u2212m and a n satisfy that n = m + c for a given integer constant c. This is used in the following example. For p being a prime power, in the grid (D p , +, =, <; \u00b7) from Example 3, the relation \u2261 is semiautomatic using the representation given in Remark 11. To see this, for a given area \u00b7 p k , (i) one can disjunct over all factorisations 1 \u00b7 2 of which are pairs of natural numbers not divisible by p, then (ii) check whether the length of the sides of a given rectangle are of the form 1 \u00b7 p i and 2 \u00b7 p j with i + j = k, where i, j are the positions of the last nonzero digits in the p-adic representation of the lengths and (iii) check, by Remark 11, whether i + j are the given constant k.

It is also clear that (R, +; \u00b7) is not \u03c9-semiautomatic, as one otherwise would need uncountably many different \u03c9-automata for recognising the uncountably many functions x \u2192 r \u00b7 x for constants r \u2208 R. So the best what one can expect is that (R, +, <, =) is \u03c9-automatic and that there are countably many functions f r : x \u2192 r \u00b7 x which are \u03c9-automatic as well. These functions certainly include, independent of the ring representation, all f r with r \u2208 Q, as one only verifies the relation x \u00b7 r = y and for r = i/j this is equivalent with verifying x \u00b7 i = y \u00b7 j with i, j are integers and multiplication with integers can be realised by repeated selfaddition. The following result shows that one can carry over ideas of Theorem 4 to \u03c9-automatic structures in order to get that multiplication with all constants from Q[ \u221a b] are \u03c9-automatic where b \u2265 2 is given. As all reals are represented and multiplication by rational constants comes for free, one can can use \u03c9-versions of the previously known representations [8, Theorem 26 ].",
