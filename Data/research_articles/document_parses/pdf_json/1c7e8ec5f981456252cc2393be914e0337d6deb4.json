This has been especially the case in China. Shanghai has grown to be a city that rivals New York as a center of trade, commerce, and marketing. Where we live and the financial debt we carry is constantly increasing. Young people all over the world are searching for their place in society where there are no jobs, and where learning to learn has become the new criteria of existence. A 'flexible subject' is demanded for industry. It seems we must continually be in school so that we can keep up with technology, both formally and informally. With the COVID pandemic of 2020, this situation has been exacerbated. The question of how the world's economy is about to change is in the balance as a 'depression' is likely with so many unemployed in each and every country.",

In \ube48\uc9d1 (Bin-jip, literal translation is Empty House, unfortunately sold as 3-Iron as an English title, 2004), we are introduced to a young man, Tae-suk, who has no last name. He is homeless, yet seems extraordinarily happy, practicing golf, a symbolic game for the rich businessmen and CEOs, with a three-iron, the most difficult club to use and control the ball. 1 The story line is that he breaks into homes of (mostly) wealthy people who are on vacation. Rather than stealing anything, he ends up repairing broken things. He makes himself 'at home.' Eventually, he breaks into a house where a young woman, Sun-hwa, is being abused by her rich businessman husband. The young man 'rescues' her. She leaves her husband, and she and the young man begin to live what is a nomadic existence, occupying empty houses wherever they find them. In the last house they occupy, they find an old man that had died. Tae-suk and Sun-hwa lovingly give him a traditional burial, but the dead father's son comes to the house and the two are arrested. Upon investigation, the young woman is released and sent back to her business husband while young man is detained, put in prison until they find out if he indeed had killed the old man. The police are unable to find any history of this young man. No family name, no family, nothing. It is as though he were a ghost, occupying time and space that are outside the symbolic universe.",

Another way of living and being outside of the way Korean society is structured, a parallel universe that is 'outside' Korean society and yet intimately inside it as well. This is a folded space and time (Deleuze 1992) where a different order of values insists. These values are 'timeless' in that they are part of an ethical system long since abandoned by technological societies. Kim Ki-duk does this by illustrating a mental framework (a way of becoming) that gives Tae-suk freedom despite being put into chains. We might think here of the 27 years Nelson Mandela spent in South African jail cell, as the young man is put in a small cell. It is here that Kim Ki-duk shows us how to 'become-imperceptible' 2 -that is how to become a 'free spirit' freed of material goods that are taken as the substitution for what is the most valuable things in life, like love, friendship, the repairing of broken things, walking on the earth as if it were rice paper so that the paper does not tear.",

Short-term memory is being affected because there is an overreliance on the archive-that is, the stored memory within the machine. Certain areas of the right brain begin to atrophy; they become smaller and shrivel up, just as in dementia patients. While there is some truth to this, this is not to sound the alarm regarding technologies. One should, of course, be leery of applying such research as a scare tactic. In the nineteenth-century England, women were told not to read romance novels because they would become too absorbed in these stories, which would have detrimental effects on society-meaning that their husbands were being neglected! The overuse of any one thing leads to concerns, but to remain ignorant of effects and affects of technology seems equally foolish. Franco Berardi (2015) makes a strong point: \"According to many linguists and anthropologists, the ability of Koreans to transmit digital content faster than in any other country of the world is an effect of the Hangeul writing system, which is ideally suited for digital technology\" (191).

Less well known is Nam June Paik's critical stance toward technology that his explorations of video art reveal. Paik called his strategy \"the Zen gaze,\" a way of seeing that expects the audience to 'see' where there is nothing to 'see,' and to create perception, to make us think for ourselves instead of consuming the image. Paik's conceptual work addressed the televisual and video area of images theorists like Paul Virilio (see Chapter 9) were so alarmed by. As Paik says, \"Enjoy boredom\" (from, Nam June Paik, Zen TV 1973, see also Munroe 2009 ). The 'boredom' is to make you think, to avert your gaze or vision from the short circuit of being attracted and then immediately distracted by his video artworks as if there is nothing to 'see.' In other words, Paik is asking viewers to contemplate rather than consume screen media. The title of his monumental sculpture, 'The More the Better' becomes rather ironic from this understanding. His Zen gaze is evident in this work as well. The viewer becomes quickly absorbed by the many television sets that arise from the circulation of images on the tower's surface, at the same time distraction arises almost immediately as it is impossible to concentrate on the entire work, not even by looking at individual television sets that have 'found footage,' some from the broadcasts of the 1988 Olympic events, but no narratives can be 'read.' Paik also places empty white screens in among these 1000+ screens to further distract the viewers. The spectator encounters an endless circulation of images that is a strong contrast to the static quality of the tower that offers another critical distance for possible contemplation.",

Paik is more interested in the social commentary of the televised image and the way his monumental tower addresses the iconic towers of the past like Tatlin's Monument to the Third International, Brancusi's Endless Tower, and Stonehenge. These works appeared on the cover of the art catalogue in 1988.

            "text": "Paik's use of the Zen gaze via closed-circuit technology appears throughout his oeuvre, most prominently perhaps in the series of Buddha video artworks that he did, the most famous being TV Buddha (1974) , which is so minimalist that it raises many questions as to what boredom as contemplation is all about. As Hans Belting (2002) put it, \"There is actually no viewer but a Buddha statue, and we are seeing what the statue cannot see: the duplication of the same image which thereby empties itself. The statue is also an image which means that an image is mirrored in an image\" (402). Paik was to do many variations on this theme, such as his Techno Buddha, Whitney Buddha (1982) and his Something Pacific (1986). Eventually, turning to Rodin's \"The Thinker\" to bring home that the Zen gaze in art is not about the image. It's about turning our contemplation to the world around us, asking us to think what is being presented. Paik revealed the 'riddle' of these Buddhas when he wrote: \"The very old mirror and the Buddhas are one and the same. The one who sees, and the one who is seen, are one and the same, much as the one who is mirrored, coincides with his mirror image\" (in Belting 2002: 404) . So, for Paik, the world is nothing more than an image, which is reproduced like a living mirror. Reflexivity and mirror reflection fall into one in his case. I am too ignorant to know what the subtle differences are between Tao and Zen, but it seems they meet in that emptiness of the gaze that enables us to think, which seems to directly address Deleuze's notion of the unthought where the image has yet to be framed, and the virtual remains in-potentia.",

The story is based on an incident that occurred in 2000 when Albert McFarland, a US military mortician at the Yongsan camp, ordered two assistants to dump 80 liters of formaldehyde into the sewerage system that drains into the Han River. Despite the outrage by environmental activists and demonstrators protesting against US military presence, Albert McFarland got away with a light sentence, charged $4000 fine by the Korean Ministry of justice, and given a 30-day suspension by the United States Forces Korea (USFK). One wonders who the 'real' monster in the movie is?",

While Goemul may be translated as 'monster' or 'creature' in Korean, naming the film The Host in the English is more accurate as to what Bong was after. It raises questions of international hospitality. If the Host is the monster, then it blurs the distinction between monster and society it ravages. Hospitality and hostility are found in the ambiguity of word 'host,' which raises questions of foreign influences, the role of the US military and foreign investors who have no interest in the nation's social fabric. Bong's monster is anthropomorphized as it is also a victim. We have sympathy for its condition and behavior. Its genesis emerges from the toxic outbreak of the deadly virus that reporters claim could be traced to an US officer treated in a US military hospital, but these turn out to be questionable facts in this movie. Perhaps there was no virus to begin with? But the population will be treated with 'Agent Yellow' according to the United States and the World Health Organization. The allusion is to Agent Orange used in Vietnam, but also the yellow dust from the Gobi Desert that has brought carcinogenic pollutants from China's industrial cities into Seoul (Hsu 2015: 130, ft. 9) . The political import of Bong's movie is very obvious: Goemul is a 'sign' of the \"ambivalent and conflicted coexistence of tradition and modernity, family and the state, democracy and militarism, nationalism and imperialism/globalism, and the monstrous and the human in contemporary South Korean society\" (Lee 2018: 721) . Monsters seem to lurk everywhere globally as conspiracy theories over COVID's spread proliferate; the one that receives most traction is that it was a synthetic warfare virus manufactured either in China or in the United States, depending on what political advantage is being sought. An accident of containment set it loose. UK and US conspiracy theorists push for the first, Russian conspiracy advocates spread the second.",

The earth has phased into an ice age as scientists failed to control its atmosphere. An experiment gone awry triggered the phase change. The only way to survive was to find passage on a runaway train. The class hierarchy on the train is analogous to the current global social order. The incredibly rich 1% are in front of the train and bathed in luxurious living, and the rest of the 99% survivors are divided up in the 1001 coaches that stretch back to the last car. In the last car are the Lumpenproletariat, the discarded bodies that no one wants, where cannibalism is prevalent. 3 Much more than an allegory, a variation of such a hierarchy, Snowpiercer, can be sociologically and politically compared to the Occupy squatter movements that spread around the globe in 2011 before they were dismantled. Snowpiercer is a dystopia of our own making. The circular route of the train, which takes a year to complete, is a repetition without change and without solution. The train is run miraculously by a 'perpetual engine' that harbors a secret. When it finally derails, viewers are left with a state of ambiguity as to the hope for human survival.",

To recall, in the narrative Lee Byeong-gu is unable to save the planet from Kang Man-shik, the Emperor of the Andromedeans, who was disguised as a business executive in Seoul, doing genetic experiments to see if the human species was worth saving by eliminating violence. To spoil the 'second' ending for you, Jang ends his movies with out-takes (cuts) by showing the audience another side of Byeong-gu as a child. In the movie, he has become psychotic because of the 'mad' world he is living in. Jang, like Kim Ki-duk (Chapter 5), is another artist-symptomologist of Korean life. You see all the various scenes that you were not privileged to see in the film-scenes of Lee Byeong-gu's life that were the most tender moments to remember, like the joyful times with both parents (Screen image 10.9).",

He forces us through his film, Midway: A Message from the Gyre, to witness a tragedy that is occurring on one of the remotest islands on our planet, Midway, located on an ocean gyre that is composed of floating plastic. Tens of thousands of baby albatrosses lie dead on its shores, their bodies filled with plastic from this 'Pacific Garbage patch' (Screen image 10.10). We live in an extraordinary historical time where the greatest technologies and consumer goods are polluting the earth, species are becoming extinct, and carbon CO 2 is now at 415 parts per million at the start of 2020. We have long since crossed the 350 parts per million threshold that was considered the uppermost limit. Climate change is occurring, and unlike in previous historical periods of the earth's history where warm spells were followed by cold spells on a regular basis, there is now the danger that the planet will go into a phase that is unknowable. We, as a species, may not be able to survive. Many artists are trying to make us aware of the need to bring to consciousness as pollution seems to be chocking the planet.

During this duration, the melting 'sculpturines' undergo subtle differences of form before 'becoming extinct.' Their inactivity as they melt away speaks directly to the inactivity of humankind toward climate change. The sculptural minimalism and autonomy addresses 'every[man-person]' who cannot escape, regardless of class, wealth, and power, the impending apocalypse.",

It is the 'end of the world' on two accounts: the first is that the anthropogenic activity of 'Man' has radically changed the question of the anthropocentrism of ontology that has been centered by a Greek model. The second is the worrisome one considering our species extinction (Colebrook 2014; Ballard 2017; Grusin 2018) . The event of the Anthropocene has already taken place. Climate change is already here. Some call it a slow apocalypse as populations will have to begin to migrate when the water continues to rise and some parts of the world too hot to live or too polluted to breathe the air. G20 governments are caught by the dictates of consumer capitalism so they do not impose any sort of strict sanctions that will stop economic growth. Ecomodernism provides the necessary manifesto that leaves the entire planet 'for sale.' Commonism (Dardot and Laval 2019) has had little traction. In many respects, it may well be too late to do much about this difficult situation, except work toward 'sustainability,' a discourse already captured by market forces (Parr 2009 ). Nitrogen and the carbon dioxide thresholds have already been crossed, while species extinction is happening at an incredible rate. There is no global political will at the time of this writing that will avert this disaster. The COVID pandemic has simply made things that much worse. Oddly, enough it put a halt to pollution for a short duration, showing that drastic measures can and do make a difference. Species can never be brought back to life, despite Jurassic Park-like fantasies. They remain extinct. Only technological fixes parading as dreams are left. As art and media teachers, we have no choice but become symptomologists of our current crisis that penetrates so deeply how we live in the environment that we are modifying (Parr 2018; jagodzinski 2019; Loveless 2019) . In Bong's Snowpiercer, those in the very front of the train (especially the Wilfords' of the world who are 'running' Earth's train) are literally eating their children, not only on their dinner plates, but their use as labor power to keep the perpetual train engine going. Goya painted his famous image of Saturn Eating One of his Children as a vivid illustration and reminder that the youth of the world are being devoured by the 'greed' of Saturn. Their future robbed and their hopes crushed. So was the message by Greta Thunberg, a seventeen-year-old Swedish climate activist whose plea has been ignored by the Wilfords' of the world both at the UN and at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Climate Change and Fossil Fuel Divestment. It would seem as art and media teachers we should continue to point to the 'deeds' of Saturn today, and try to become aware of what this means for our survival as we are all riding in the same train.",
