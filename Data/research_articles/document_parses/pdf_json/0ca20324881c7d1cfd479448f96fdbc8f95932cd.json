First, vigilant social distancing has potential to flatten the curve, 1 which will both delay and suppress the outbreak peak. In addition to reducing the peak demand for ventilators, the delay would provide a window of opportunity to ramp up ventilator production. Second, it is plausible that the USA will experience several asynchronous local peaks rather than one apex. A nationalised allocation system that transfers ventilators based on state-level epidemiological projections would most efficiently capitalise on existing units. Third, the USA simply needs more ventilators. In that respect, the Defense Production Act has been invoked, compelling some automobile manufacturers to shift production to ventilators. 8 This Act also permits the Administration Projecting the demand for ventilators at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in the USA The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been straining health-care systems worldwide. For countries still in the early phase of an outbreak, there is concern regarding insufficient supply of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators to handle the impending surge in critically ill patients. To inform pandemic preparations, we projected the number of ventilators that will be required in the USA at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

To avoid triage for use of ventilators, 6 units would have to be perfectly distributed both geographically and temporally, which in turn relies on centralised coordination among states and more precise forecasting than is currently possible given the constraints on testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Worryingly, areas such as New York city are experiencing the first surge of cases in the absence of national coordination, while facing competition with other regions simultaneously trying to secure these critically important resources. 7 Also concerning is that the USA is already several weeks into its epidemic.
