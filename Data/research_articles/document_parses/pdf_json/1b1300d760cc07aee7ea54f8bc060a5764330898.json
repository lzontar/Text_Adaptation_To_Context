It is irresponsible and 115 unethical to abuse your prescribing power for potential benefits to yourself and your 116 family when the medication is actively needed by others. As physicians, we have 117 professional responsibilities to our patients and others to do what is considered to be 118 right, especially during difficult times such as now.119 120 121 The prophylactic use or knowledge of having a reserve stash of an untested drug could 122 create a false sense of invulnerability to the disease and therefore, although unlikely, 123 might undermine the prescribed behavior recommended to curtail the spread of the 124 disease such as social distancing. Additionally, optimal dosing and treatment time has 125 not been established, and hydroxychloroquine has the potential side effect of QT 126 prolongation. Without a formal medical evaluation, thorough patient history and physical 127 exam, patients receiving the drug may be at increased risk of adverse effects that 128 outweigh potential benefits of the drug in combating COVID-19 infections. 129 130 Finally, what if this physician decided to prescribe hydroxychloroquine for any patient 131 who asked for it because she felt that it might be beneficial based on limited data and in 132 vitro activity against other SARS coronaviruses?
