Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at admission are usually confirmed to have pneumonia [1] . As the designated hospital for the treatment of such patients, our center found that COVID-19 patients with normal chest CT imaging findings were unusual in clinical practice [2] . Asymptomatic patients and infected patients with normal chest images are considered carriers of SARS-CoV-2, requiring timely clinical intervention and management [3] . Here, we first discuss a patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 but had no pulmonary lesions on chest CT at the time of admission and was confirmed to have COVID-19 pneumonia during her hospital stay. The clinical problems encountered in treating such patients are discussed.",

At admission, she had no cough, sputum or shortness of breath (January 29, 2020). Fever was the only clinical manifestation, and chest CT showed that the bilateral lungs were clear ( Fig. 2A and  B) . Laboratory studies showed that all items of the routine blood tests were normal at admission. Several additional laboratory tests were abnormal, including low-density lipoprotein (2.02 mmol/L; normal range 2.6-4.1 mmol/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (32 mm/h; normal range 0.0-20.0 mm/h) [5] . She was treated with symptomatic treatment and lopinavir-ritonavir during the hospital stay. In the early days of the epidemic, there was a lack of systematic understanding of COVID-19. Because the patient's clinical symptoms did not subside, CT imaging was used to assess the evolution of the disease. On the 5th day after admission (February 3, 2020), a few ground-glass opacities were found in the subpleural area of the right lower lobe on chest CT (Fig. 2C and D) . Then, her clinical symptoms improved, and chest CT images (February 9, 2020) showed a reduction in the size of the ground-glass opacities (Fig. 2E and F). The chest CT imaging results, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests were not completely consistent during the clinical course [6] .",

As one of the main respiratory infections, pneumonia caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection is of great help to make an early clinical diagnosis. However, for patients with a suspected COVID-19 infection with specific clinical information, a one-time CT examination cannot rule out the possibility of COVID-19.
