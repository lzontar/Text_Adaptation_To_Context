Our results show that the design of ventilation is critical for reducing the risk of aerosol encounters. Inappropriate design can significantly limit the efficiency of aerosol removal, create local hot spots with orders of magnitude higher risks, and enhance aerosol deposition causing surface contamination.

However, mechanisms to contain the disease are regionally variable, with vastly different approaches being utilized by different countries, regions (such as US states), and even cities (1). This inconsistency is due in part to a lack of understanding of the transmission pathways of the disease (1). Although it has been well-accepted that the disease can be transmitted through large droplets (>5 \u00b5m) capable of carrying sufficient viral load produced by coughing and sneezing (2, 3), there is substantial debate regarding whether the transmission can be airborne with small droplets (4-6). Nevertheless, growing evidence, including the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in collected aerosols (7) and the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to remain viable for hours in aerosols (8), indicates such a transmission pathway is possible. Moreover, considering the high viral loads found in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic individuals infected with COVID-19 (9), it has been hypothesized that small droplets and particles (hereafter referred to collectively as aerosols) generated during normal respiratory behaviors, such as breathing and speaking, could lead to the fast spread of the disease (10-12). However, despite a number of studies of aerosol generation from these behaviors (12-17), there is a lack of in situ characterization, particularly for breathing due to its low yield of aerosol production, limiting our ability to model the spread of aerosols associated with asymptomatic individuals.

This information is then used as the inputs for high-fidelity numerical simulation of aerosol transport under several practical settings, which considers the evaporation, drag, gravity, and residence lifetime of each aerosol produced by a simulated asymptomatic individual.

            "text": "The ensemble average flow field of exhaled gas (Fig. 1A) , characterized using quantitative Schlieren imaging, shows an axisymmetric cone shape with an averaged cone angle ( \u0305 ) of 25.0\u00b0. The streamwise flow velocity averaged over the cross section of the exhalation cone (\u2329 \u232a \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 ) decays from 0.3 m/s near the mouth to almost zero at about 200 mm (< 1 feet) downstream. These measurements demonstrate the limited spatial range of direct influence associated with normal breathing, in contrast to violent expiratory behaviors such as coughing which yields a cone angle of 65\u00b0 (19) and flow speed up to 11.2 m/s with the influence zone extending up to ~2.5 m (20) . The exhaled gas flow fields from different participants show similar patterns with small variation in quantitative measures (e.g. cone angle, exhaled flow rate, etc., Table S1 with details in the supplementary materials). The normalized exhaled gas flow rate (\u0302E) in an exhalation cycle (period E ) extracted from flow field, rises sharply at the beginning of the cycle, peaks around 0.2 E followed by a sustained rate over a duration of about 0.3 E , and then decays rapidly (Fig. 1B) . Such breathing pattern is similar across different participants as they are instructed to breath in the same fashion, but the peak value of \u0302E (\u0302E ,max ) varies substantially among individuals (Fig. S4 in the supplementary materials) potentially due to different natural breathing depths of each individual (21-23). The DIH measurements provide the first detailed characterization of the generation of aerosols during normal breathing in terms of their concentration, size, and shape. The measurements have shown an average concentration of 170 aerosols per liter exhaled gas (i.e., 44 aerosols per breath) from an ensemble average of 160 minutes DIH data from eight participants. The particle size distribution peaks around 1.5 \u00b5m with a sharp decay towards smaller and larger sizes and has an averaged value of 1.7 \u00b5m (Fig. 1C) , which is substantially higher than the 0.6 \u00b5m obtained from OPC measurement (13) and close to the 2 \u00b5m measured using microscopic examination of aerosols deposited on a glass slide through an impactor (13) . Most aerosols are below 5 \u00b5m and only 0.2 % above. The 3D trajectories of aerosols (>5 \u00b5m) within the exhaled gas fit within the breathing cone determined from the Schlieren imaging for all the participants with about 10% aerosols leaking from the side of the mouth occasionally (Fig. 1D ). Besides the particle size, the shape of aerosols can be obtained using DIH. Interestingly, in addition to a large fraction of round-shaped aerosols, a substantial fraction yields irregular shapes with edges and corners. Observed both above (Fig. 1E ) and below 5 \u00b5m (Fig. 1F) , these two types of aerosols with distinct shapes correspond respectively to the droplets and crystalline aerosols generated from human breathing reported in the literature (13, 24) . Particularly, through mass spectra of aerosols, the literature has revealed the presence of nonvolatile solutes such as potassium, calcium, and chorine contents in crystalline aerosols (13, 24) , which are likely to be generated from the alveolar fluid from the lower respiratory tract (12) . To quantify the content of aerosols based on their shapes, the histogram of roundness of aerosols (Fig. S7 with details in the supplemental materials), is obtained (Fig. 1G) , and a roundness threshold of 0.5 is selected to categorize the aerosols into droplet and crystalline types according to the literature (25, 26) . Accordingly, our measurements suggest about 33% of aerosols produced by normal breathing are crystalline type appearing both below and above 5 \u00b5m (Fig. S12 shows that aerosol roundness is independent with the size). These crystalline aerosols are usually hygroscopic (24) and could take up moisture from the environment with increasing humidity to form droplets up to 2.5 times of their original sizes (27) . It has been suggested moisture can insulate viruses from extreme environments, in favor of their survival during transmission (28) . Therefore, these crystalline aerosols could also (in addition to droplets) serve as the virus carriers for airborne transmission. The aerosol measurements exhibit interesting variability across different participants using the same normal breathing techniques (Fig. 2) . Specifically, the concentration of aerosols larger than 5 \u00b5m varies significantly across different individuals ( Fig. 2A) while the aerosols smaller than 5 \u00b5m do not show such large variation (Fig. 2B ). In particular, the concentration of aerosols larger than 5 \u00b5m produced by one participant (P1) is more than twice the average concentration of the eight participants. Considering aerosols in this scale range contain higher viral loads (29, 30) and can evaporate rapidly to be airborne, such an individual can be more effective in spreading viruses when asymptomatic. It is worth noting that other studies on aerosol generation during breathing and speaking also reported the presence of such superemitters, with population percentage ranging from 6% to 25% (12, 31) , consistent with the percentage of such individual (12.5%) observed in our experiments. Superemitters of aerosols have been related to the superspreaders of infectious diseases in the literature (10, 31, 32) . Remarkably, the percentage of superemitters in our study (though there is large uncertainty due to the small sample size) coincides well with the 10% of superspreading events of COVID-19 observed in preliminary clinical data (33) , providing further support to the spreading of COVID-19 through aerosol generation from asymptomatic individuals. In addition, the fraction of crystalline aerosols varies from 26% to 40% across different participants (Fig. 2C) , and shows a strong correlation with the peak of normalized exhaled flow rate (\u0302E ,max ) defined earlier (Fig. 2D ). Considering the connection between \u0302E ,max and the natural breathing depth of individuals as noted earlier (21) (22) (23) , our results provide strong evidence that the deeper exhalation can lead to the generation of a higher fraction of crystalline aerosols from the lower respiratory tract as suggested in the literature (12). , respectively, and (C) a small supermarket setting with a simulated asymptomatic shopper (his/her 10 stops along the dashed route are marked in the schematic) and the ceiling ventilation system located at the back corner (supplementary movie S6) and entrance of the supermarket (supplementary movie S7), respectively. Except for the low ventilation setting in A, the ventilation rate of each setting is designed to replace all the air in the space every two minutes, representing the upper bound of recommended ventilation condition of each setting. Under each setting, the risk of a person encountering virus-containing aerosols at one specific location ( risk ) is evaluated as the total aerosol number passing through this location during the simulation time, which can be interpreted as number of aerosols a person can inhale at this location during the simulated time. Note that such an estimate of the inhaled aerosol number only provides an estimate of maximum aerosol encounter since it does not consider the detailed flow processes involved in the inhalation of aerosols. In the 3D contour plots, the wall contours are the contours of risk spatially averaged (denoted as \u0305 risk ) along x, y, and z directions, respectively. In addition, assuming the height of each individual is ~1.75 m, selected horizontal slices of risk contour at the height of human mouth are highlighted to show the risk for individuals standing (1.6 m for A and C) or sitting (1.2 m for B) at different locations, and several representative locations are marked as safe or hot based on their risk values (safe criterion: risk \u2264 1 for A; risk \u2264 200 for B; risk \u2264 100 for C).",

With high ventilation, the aerosols from the emitter disperse to a large portion of the elevator within one minute, but risk is extremely low (\u2264 1) in most of the space (e.g., the two \"safe\" spots). To assess a riskier scenario, we consider the emitter speaking continuously for one minute and producing aerosols at a rate 10 times that of normal breathing according to the literature (31) . Without changing ventilation, this scenario exhibits a proportional increase in risk and the expansion of regions with high risks (e.g., the \"hot\" spot). With significant reduction in ventilation, the dispersion of aerosols is confined to one quadrant of the elevator on the emitter side, imposing little risk to the people who are not standing in close proximity to the emitter (e.g., in the two \"safe\" spots) but two orders of magnitude higher risks for some local hot spots in the quadrant. Remarkably, even under high ventilation, only a small fraction (~15%) of aerosols is vented out, and the number drops to zero with reduced ventilation. This observation is associated with the presence of stable flow circulation zones in the space (Fig. S13) , which traps the aerosols and increases their residence time to be significantly longer than the simulated time here. In addition, such circulation zone strengthens with increasing ventilation causing more wall deposition of aerosols (Fig. S16) .",

When the ceiling ventilation is at the back corner in the classroom (i.e., far from the emitter), the ventilation spreads aerosols to the back half of the classroom. Particularly, the region near the vent can yield a significantly higher risk , such that a student sitting in a hot spot in the back could inhale several times more aerosols than a front student at a safe spot. As the ventilation is relocated to the emitter side, the spread of aerosols is mostly confined to the region before the front students and the risk for each student is significantly reduced compared to the former scenario. Remarkably, despite the rate of ventilation set to replace all the air in the space every two minutes for both scenarios, no more than 10% of the total emitted aerosols are vented out after 50 minutes, although the latter (i.e., ventilation near the emitter) doubles the fraction of vented-out aerosols of the former (Table S2) . Such inefficient aerosol removal through ventilation is largely associated with the presence of many stable circulation regions in the large space (Fig.  S14 ), which increases aerosol residence time, causes the majority of aerosols deposited to surfaces (i.e., 88% of the total, Table S2 ), and forms hot spots of surface contamination (e.g., the two ground corners on the same side of the classroom for both ventilation scenarios, Fig. S17 ).",

When the ceiling ventilation is in the back corner, the aerosols spread across the entire supermarket, and particularly, a hot spot is formed in the space between the leftmost shelf and corner near the ventilation due to strong local circulation and entrainment of higher speed channeling flow formed in this space (Fig. S15 ). However, the cashier, standing near the entrance, is placed in a relatively safe zone. With the ventilation moved to the entrance, the overall spread of aerosols is reduced, but several other hot spots emerge, including one in front of the cashier increasing his/her risk by about two orders of magnitude. Compared with the classroom setting, the fraction of vented-out aerosols (~50% for both scenarios, Table S2 ) is significantly increased here, even at similar ventilation and shorter time duration. Such increase in the aerosol removal efficiency is primarily attributed to the motion of the emitter which limits the chance of a large fraction of aerosols becoming trapped in the same stable circulations. Additionally, due to the presence of dividing structures (i.e., shelves), the stable circulation zones reduce in scale (Fig. S15 ) in comparison to those under the classroom setting, causing less wall deposition except in the back corner near the ventilation (Fig. S18 ).",

Our results show significant spatial heterogeneity of risks in confined spaces under three practical settings, supporting the interesting observations of COVID-19 infection associated with air conditioning in a restaurant (34) . Specifically, although ventilation enables the removal of virus-containing aerosols, it can help spread aerosols to larger spaces beyond the proximity of asymptomatic individuals. Inappropriate ventilation can also lead to local hot spots with risks that are orders of magnitude higher than other places depending on the relative positioning of aerosol emitter, ventilation, and space settings. In addition, ventilation can also enhance aerosol deposition on surfaces causing patched regions with high surface contamination, consistent with the large amount SARS-CoV-2 RNAs extracted from samples collected from hospital floors and air vents (35, 36) . Particularly, ventilation at a single location, even at the highest rate in the current practice, is highly inefficient at removing aerosols, due to the presence of relatively stable flow circulation zones in the space and the large amount of aerosol deposition on surfaces. This result suggests that improvements to air filters alone are not enough to reduce the aerosol concentration.",

Specifically, our results suggest that optimizing ventilation settings (e.g., adding more sites of ventilation and/or more turbulence to disrupt stable circulation zones) even under the current ventilation capacity can significantly improve the efficiency of aerosol removal. Adjusting the placement of occupants (e.g., students or cashier in our cases) in the room to avoid hot spots and frequent cleaning of surfaces prone to contamination can reduce the risks. Wearing masks to cut down the source of aerosol generation can significantly lower the risks of airborne infection. Additionally, our in situ characterization of aerosol generation through breathing shows its large variability and correlation with individual breathing depth, indicating the need for effective risk assessment at an individual level. Our study can be further extended to a broad range of practical settings (e.g., air cabin, restaurant, gym, etc.) with more detailed physics (e.g., exhalation, inhalation flow physics, etc.) and individual characteristics (e.g., exhalation behavior, movement, etc.) as well as more precise HAVC models incorporated to yield more accurate risk assessment under these settings.",

Schlieren imaging has previously been used to characterize exhalation (39) and study airflow patterns with and without a facial mask (40) . The components in the high-speed Schlieren imaging system are shown in Fig. S2 . It consists of a blue fiber-coupled LED light source, a concave mirror (30.5 cm diameter, 2.3 m focal length), a blade, and a camera (NAC Memrecam HX-5) with imaging lens (Nikon AF Nikkor 80-200 mm 1:2.8 D). The image size is 960 \u00d7 936 pixels (32 \u00d7 32 cm field of view) and is recorded at 1000 Hz with a 100 \u03bcs exposure time. Each participant takes five breaths for a duration of 20 s. The time-resolved standard deviation of pixel intensity of the Schlieren sequence corresponding to each participant is used to determine the geometry of the exhaled gas jet (i.e., breathing cone angle, shown as Fig. S3 ). We use optical flow to quantify the flow field, using open source software developed by Liu et al (41) , with a 5-frame skip to ensure sufficient displacement of flow structures inside the exhalation cone. The interrogation window is chosen as 32 \u00d7 32 pixels. The flow field is subsequently used to determine the volumetric flow rate of the exhaled gas jet by integration of the flow velocity over the cross section of the exhalation cone at a fixed location (3 cm downstream of the mouthpiece), assuming the jet is axisymmetric. For the ensembled average flow field of the breathing (Fig. 1A in the main text) , the averaged flow field of 20 Schlieren video frames around the 0.2 E of each breath was taken first. Then, the flow fields of 40 breaths of all the participants are realigned to a specific breathing cone captured from participant 2 and averaged to have the flow field shown in Fig. 1A. Fig. S4 shows the breathing patterns of all participants observed in the present study. Note that despite similar patterns of breathing, the normalized peak exhaled gas flow rate varies substantially across the participants. Table S1 is a summary of the Schlieren results of all the participants including their average exhaled gas flow rate and the breathing cone angle.",

            "text": "DIH is an optical diagnostic technique which allows in situ imaging of individual microparticles in an extended sample volume (i.e., orders of magnitude larger than conventional microscopy in the imaging depth of field) without focusing (42) (43) (44) . DIH operates using the principle of optical diffraction; spatially and temporally coherent reference light beam illuminates the sample (aerosols). Light scattered by the aerosols interferes with the unscattered portion of the reference beam. The recorded diffraction pattern (or hologram) can be digitally refocused through convolution with a diffraction kernel, to determine the size, shape, location, and optical properties of the aerosols. Two magnifications are used to increase the measured size range. The 1X magnification digital inline holographic imaging (DIH) system is used to image exhaled aerosols ranging in size primarily from 10 \u00b5m to 50 \u00b5m. Our 1X DIH system, shown in Fig. S5 , consists of a He-Ne laser, a spatial filter (Newport Inc) and a collimation lens (f=45 mm) producing a 2 cm diameter gaussian beam. A large format CMOS camera (4000 \u00d7 4000 pixels; Viewworks Inc) captures the holograms over a 18 \u00d7 18 mm field of view at a resolution of 4.5 \u00b5m/pixel, sampling at 35 frames/s. Since the exhaled jet diameter is 16 mm, the volume containing aerosols is 18 \u00d7 18 16 mm 3 (5 mL). The field of view and center of the laser beam are vertically aligned with the mouthpiece opening and offset by 1.5 cm (see Fig. S6 ) to ensure the sample volume covers the whole breathing jet at the measurement location. The measurements from each participant are repeated 20 times, with each dataset consisting of a 30 s hologram sequence replicating the breathing technique used in the Schlieren measurements. Hologram processing has three steps. First, the holograms are resized to 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels to reduce processing time and enhanced by time averaged background division to remove stationary artifacts present in the image and remove spatial intensity variations. Then, the holograms are reconstructed by convolution with Rayleigh Sommerfeld diffraction kernel (43) to obtain a 3D optical field. Such 3D optical field is used to determine the rough 3D centroids of the exhaled aerosols. The original size (4000 \u00d7 4000 pixels) holograms containing particles are reconstructed near the rough longitudinal location determined from the first step to get the precise longitudinal planes of the aerosols. We combined three criteria to distinguish the exhaled aerosols from the background particles. First, the aerosols have a streamwise speed from 0.1 to 0.3 m/s near the DIH measurement window according to Schlieren measurements. Second, the initial z locations (longitudinal) of the aerosols are restricted between -8 mm and +8 mm to the mouth, which overlaps with the position of the jet from the image plane. Third, the aerosol trajectories generally follow the exhaled cone shape established from the Schlieren measurements. The aerosol size and shape are manually measured from 100 \u00d7 100 pixels cropped images using ImageJ. We use the area-equivalent diameter p (Eqn. 1) to quantify the aerosol size and use roundness (Eqn. 2) as a measure of aerosol shape. The cross sectional area and the major axis length of the aerosols are given by A and maj , respectively, where the latter is determined by an ellipse fit (a few samples are shown in Fig. S7 ).",

The camera provides an imaging resolution is 0.23 \u00b5m/pixel resulting in a sample volume of 0.9 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 4 mm 3 (3 \u00d7 10 -3 mL). The individual components and participant head position for the 20X DIH measurements are shown as Fig. S8 and Fig. S9 , respectively. The reduced depth of the sample volume is due to the magnification of the imaging objective lens. The system is capable of resolving aerosols that are around 0.5 \u00b5m very accurately. Similar to the 1X data acquisition, the 20X experiments consist of 20 repetitions with each participant, generating 30 s of data each. Once recorded, the holograms are processed following the same algorithm described above for the 1X DIH measurements.",

The flow field traps the aerosols in the recirculation zone, and drives them close to the wall. These aerosols have a long residence time near the wall, which increases the chance of wall deposition. No recirculation zone is formed with the low ventilation rate of 15 CFM near the roof and thus, most of the aerosol particles are deposited on the wall by the large recirculation zone near the emitter height, without any aerosols being removed. By contrast, the high ventilation flow rate of 212 CFM is able to suck aerosol to the roof. In the classroom case (shown in Fig. S14) , the near-instructor ventilation generates a strong recirculation zone near the instructor and keeps the aerosol from spreading to the far end of the classroom. As a comparison, the far-end ventilation creates a large recirculation throughout the whole classroom, driving the aerosols to spread to the wall and to the far end of the classroom. In the supermarket case (shown in Fig. S15) , the valley effect below the far-end (from entrance) ventilation generates a high flow velocity and sucks most of aerosol particles to the nearfield below the ventilation. However, in the near-entrance ventilation scenario, the aerosols injected at the first several stops are pulled to the cashier, leading to larger danger of aerosol encounter (i.e., higher risk ). In addition, gas flow velocity magnitude when the ventilation is at the far corner is larger than the velocity magnitude when the ventilation is near the entrance, due to the narrow space between the wall and shopping shelf below the ventilation. This explains the more homogenous aerosol distribution when the ventilation is at the far corner.",

The same ventilation which creates the same flow field, leads to the same wall aerosol deposition positions on elevator walls. When the ventilation rate is lower, the weak recirculation zone on the top is not capable of spreading the aerosols to different walls. As a result, the designated flow field drives all the aerosols to one wall (i.e., the left wall). In the classroom scenario (Fig. S17) , the deposited aerosol numbers are much more than the elevator case, due to continuous speaking of 50 minutes. The comparison between far-end and near-instructor ventilation shows that the near-instructor ventilation keeps the wall aerosols near the speaking instructor, while in the far-end ventilation case, the created recirculation zone deposits the aerosols to all the walls in the classroom. In the supermarket settings (Fig. S18) , the far-away ventilation sucks a lot of aerosols to be deposited to the wall near the ventilation, due to the strong velocity magnitude below the ventilation. In the near-entrance ventilation case, aerosols generated by the far-end shopper directly deposit to the floor due to gravity, since the weak flow field in the far-end field.
