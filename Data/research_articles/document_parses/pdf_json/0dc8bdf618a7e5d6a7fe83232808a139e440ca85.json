The questionnaires were spread over a network of educational communities on Facebook from February 7 to February 28, 2020. Using the snowball sampling method, researchers delivered the survey to teachers and parents to provide formal consent before they forwarded it to their students and children. In order to measure the influence of students' socioeconomic status and occupational aspirations on their learning habits during school closures, the survey included three major groups of questions: (1) Individual demographics, including family socioeconomic status, school type, and occupational aspirations; (2) Student's learning habits, including hours of learning before and during the period of school suspension, with and without other people's support; and (3) Students' perceptions of their self-learning during the school closures. There was a total of 920 clicks on the survey link, but only 460 responses accompanied by consent forms were received. Non-credible answers (e.g., year of birth after 2009, more than 20 hours of learning per day) were eliminated. The final dataset included 420 valid observations.",

While a decrease in students' formal learning habits during holidays is seasonal and predictable [1] , the adjustments in their learning habits during a sudden pandemic are still unresearched. The preparation of this dataset is a response to the call for interdisciplinary research about the effects of the novel coronavirus pandemic [2] . As a country that dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak very early and productively, Vietnam is a notable case study of instantaneous and conspicuous collaboration between the government and society [3] . However, the shift in the educational system was unforeseen and caused significant side effects [4] . This dataset [5] focused on the learning habits of 420 secondary students (Grade 6-12) in Hanoi during the first two weeks of school closures due to COVID-19. The dataset includes three major groups of variables: (A) Individual demographics, including family socioeconomic status (SES), school type, and occupational aspirations; (B) Students' learning habits, including hours of learning before and during the period of school suspension, with and without other people's support; and (C) Students' perceptions of their self-learning during the school closures. In addition, we added a question to measure the integration of online lessons during this time with sustainability topics. Detailed descriptions of all variables, together with the questions for each variable, and descriptive tables and figures can be found in the Mendeley data repository [5] . ",

Variables in group A related to students' demographics, including SES factors and students' self-evaluated competencies. Scholars have pointed out that SES factors such as monthly family income, parents' occupations, number of siblings, school type, and grade level have significant influences on students' learning habits [6, 7] . This study complements the conventional notion of SES with additional variables about students' competencies. Specifically in the case of Vietnam, we added subjects for university entrance, which demonstrate students' occupational aspirations, and English, which is a crucial competency in today's world.",

All items in this section were measured using a five-point Likert scale (1: Totally Disagree, 5: Totally Agree). First, we examined students' perceptions on the necessity for self-learning during COVID-19. According to the literature on transformative learning, students' learning practices are influenced by their beliefs about learning and influences from teachers, parents, and peers [9] . Thus, we constructed the variable of \"students' necessity for self-learning\" using the following items: (i) to ensure my learning progress; (ii) to maintain my learning habits; (iii) influenced by teachers; (iv) influenced by parents; (v) influenced by siblings; (vi) influenced by friends. Second, we measured students' self-reports on factors that influence self-learning effectiveness. This variable consisted of different physical factors (the availability of learning resources [10] , learning space [11] ), psychological factors (self-motivation [12] , family support [13] ), and behavioural factors (concentration, goal setting [14] , communication and peer collaboration [15] ).",
