In response to aggravated hate crimes such as racial taunts on 167 school campuses, shunning on public transit, and cyberbullying on social media, some 168 organizations have responsively and prolifically used media to raise awareness for anti-Asian 169 harassment and promote allyship for those affected (Jeung, Kulkarni, & Choi, 2020).170 One example in the United States includes the collaboration between two civil rights and 171 advocacy organizations to create a new online reporting center for incidents of bias against Asian 172 Americans (Redden, 2020). According to the \"Stop Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) 173 Hate\" project data shared by the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council on Affirmative 174Action, data from April 3, 2020 revealed that 1,135 incident reports of verbal harassment,175    shunning, and physical assault were received within two weeks. Further, data revealed that AAPI women were harassed at twice the rate of men, and AAPI children/youth were involved in 6from California and New York constituted over 58 percent of all reports, and 179 AAPI women were harassed 2.3 times more than AAPI men. By May 13, 2020, Stop AAPI Hate180 had received over 1,710 incident reports from 45 states in the US, where 90 percent of 181 respondents believed they were targeted because of their race. Notable incidents reported by 182 council members Choi, Jeung, and Kulkarni (2020) included, but were not limited to: We were having community circle in our grade 4 classroom. One of the students said 184 \"kill the Chinese\" in Spanish when it was his turn to speak. Many of the Spanish 185 speaking children laughed. I asked to have what he said translated. I explained to the 186 class that the statement was offensive and not part of our norms for community circle. I 187 brought it to the principal's attention, and she spoke to the student. Overheard in public restroom: \"Thank god no Chinese children were at soccer practice to 189 infect others.\" Tried to correct aspersion, but [I was] totally ignored by white patron. My kids were at the park with their dad (who is white). An older white man pushed my 7-191 year-old daughter off of her bike and yelled at my husband to, \"Take your hybrid kids 192 home because they're making everyone sick.\" 193 \u2022 I walked into the train carriage, and immediately two teenage girls started screaming and 194 \"ewwwing\" and making a show of covering their mouths and faces with a scarf. Then, 195 [they] stood up and ran to the other end of the carriage (which was more crowded) jeering 196 at me.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "I was walking my dog at night and a car swerved toward me on the sidewalk.

Survey findings from eighty-five medical students from Asia 209 revealed that the global panic triggered xenophobic reactions toward students before the first 210 case of COVID-19 was even confirmed in Poland (Rzymski & Nowicki, 2020). Results indicated 211 that 61.2 percent of the surveyed students experienced prejudice, 47.1 percent of the prejudice 212 occurred in public transportation and on the street, and prejudice was more frequently 213 encountered by those who wore face masks (71.2 percent) than those who did not (28.2 percent) Rzymski & Nowicki, 2020). Similar to examples provided by Stop AAPI Hate, reported 215 reactions to Asian students included: 216 stepping away, changing seats on the bus, being asked to keep the safe distance, covering 217 mouth and nose, showing judgmental facial expressions, pointing with a finger and 218 whispering comments in Polish, spitting, tossing a beer bottle and using offensive 219 language. When indicating how much these situations affected the surveyed students 220 using a Likert scale, a score of 5 was the most frequently selected (Rzymski & Nowicki, 221 2020, p. 3).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "collected survey data from Chinese people in mainland China and overseas, as well as 225 descriptive secondary data from sources such as newspapers and Internet publications.
