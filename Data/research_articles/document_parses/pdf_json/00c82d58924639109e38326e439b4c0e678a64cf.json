Excess death rates were estimated using a Serfling model with a parametric bootstrapping approach to calibrate baseline death levels with quantified uncertainty. Excess all-cause and pneumonia and influenza mortality rates were estimated for different pandemic waves and age groups. The youngest and oldest persons experienced the highest excess mortality rates, and young adults faced the highest standardized mortality risk.

For example, the most severely affected patients were often young adults who had heliotrope cyanosis and acute respiratory distress.

Many people fell ill with respiratory symptoms in May 1918, including King Alfonso XIII, which was well documented in the press (10). Because respiratory disease outbreaks occurred in neighboring France as early as April 1918, it is likely that the virus was introduced into Spain via Spanish and Portuguese labor migrants in southern France (11) . Research has provided abundant information regarding the timing, severity, and excess mortality of the 1918 influenza pandemic in Spain (10) (11) (12) , as well as some estimates of transmission potential of the virus within the city of Madrid (12) (13) (14) . Nevertheless, these analyses provide a primarily descriptive picture of the pandemic in Spain through the lens of period press reports and midcentury publications, including a sense of the evolution of sanitation and health in Spain (10, 11, 15, 16) , though newly digitized data sources provide increased opportunities to quantify the impact of the pandemic on the Spanish population (12) .

Moreover, the spring wave may have largely affected the city itself (which we analyzed) and the surrounding province (the subject of the prior study (12) ) to a lesser degree, resulting in different excess mortality estimates. The total impact of the spring wave could also extend to the second wave; perhaps those living in the city gained some immunity from exposure to the first wave, whereas those without this exposure did not benefit from cross-protection.

Only strains from the spring and fall waves of 1918 have been studied, to our knowledge, meaning that the extent to which earlier and later strains differed cannot be confirmed (5, 47, 48) .
