In order to select the appropriate management strategy, it is important to take into consideration the clinical status of the patient and the likelihood of concomitant COVID- 19 . Whenever SARS-CoV-2 testing can be obtained before an invasive procedure, this strategy should be prioritized. However, in some cases, clinical presentation may require immediate intervention. In this case, or when COVID-19 is confirmed, every effort should be made to reduce the risk of viral spreading with protective measures 17-19 that have to be implemented from the first contact with the patient in the emergency department (ED) or in the out-of-hospital setting i. It is critical to differentiate patients with type 1 MI from COVID- 19 patients, who might present with troponin elevation and/or ST changes, that are associated with respiratory symptoms and chest pain, without a coronary aetiology. 3,12 ii. STEMI patients can be haemodynamically stable or present with cardiogenic shock (CS) or a mechanical complication. In the latter scenarios, the need for advanced care should be assessed in the light of local resources and the patient's age and comorbidities. Appropriate treatment should not be delayed, even if COVID-19 is confirmed or suspected. Possible causes of delay in time to reperfusion are due to reluctance by the patients to call emergency numbers, the late arrival of the ambulance to pick up the patient, and then delayed time of arrival of the ambulance to the hospital due to congestion and multiple calls because of the pandemic. Nevertheless, because of need for protection of other patients and HCWs, this may lead to further in-hospital delays. 20, 21 iii. Actions, such as public campaigns to raise awareness, dedicated lines with an emergency number, dedicated ambulances for cardiovascular emergencies, and entry points in ED with dedicated hospital pathways (see Section 9), can be considered at appropriate stages of the pandemic aiming at reducing these delays. The initial experience in affected areas suggests that as the infection spreads, there is a period characterized by low numbers of STEMI followed by a phase of increased numbers of late presenters and related mechanical complications. 20 iv. The majority of NSTEMI patients do not have ongoing ischaemia and respond well to medical treatment, allowing time to test the patients for COVID-19 infection. Very high risk NSTEMI patients should be managed according to STEMI pathways. v. Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest constitute a group of patients in which prognostic assessment is of paramount importance in order to avoid futile intubation and ICU stay at a time of limited resources. The threshold to bring out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients to ICU and to the cathlab (in the case of STEMI or very high risk NSTEMI) depends on the capability of the hospital to admit the patient and also the clinical status of the patient upon arrival. vi. As discussed in a recent document from the European Association of CardioVascular Imaging, chest CT is frequently used to confirm COVID-19 pneumonia and might provide possible synergies of and opportunities for cardiac imaging. 16 vii. It can be considered to integrate the protocol alongside CCTA in order to exclude or confirm an ACS in COVID-19 pneumonia where elevated troponins are common. viii. Medication of NSTEMI patients should follow the usual practice. In patients undergoing specific COVID-19 treatments, some interactions have been reported between lopinavir/ritonavir, antiviral drugs, and cardiovascular drugs. Lopinavir/ritonavir may inhibit 63 CYP3A4 with the need for dosage changes or avoidance of clopidogrel and ticagrelor and direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban and rivaroxaban. Lopinavir/ritonavir also influence statin metabolism; therefore, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin should be administered at the lowest possible dose. 3 In terms of protection, two scenarios are relevant: direct patient contact with or without the risk for aerosol generation. Invasive procedures carrying a direct risk of aerosol generation are resuscitation, intubation, transoesophageal echocardiography (this should be limited and alternatives should be taken into account such as serial transthoracic echocardiography, CT, or cardiac magnetic resonance), 16 and any procedures during which the patient can become unwell, with active coughing or vomiting.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 214, "end": 216, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 394, "end": 396, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 940, "end": 942, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1880, "end": 1883, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1886, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3391, "end": 3393, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4120, "end": 4121, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 4529, "end": 4531, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical scenarios"}, {"text": "\u2022 It is essential to differentiate type 1 MI from other causes of troponin elevation and/or ST changes without a coronary aetiology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Key messages"}, {"text": "\u2022 Initial reduction in STEMI presentations are observed, followed by a surge in late STEMI more frequently associated with cardiogenic shock and mechanical complications.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Key messages"}, {"text": "\u2022 STEMI and high risk NSTEMI have to be managed as COVID-19 positive, and dedicated entry points in ED as well as in hospital pathway need to be organized.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Key messages"}, {"text": "\u2022 CCTA can be performed as an added protocol in those undergoing a CT scan, considered according to local resources.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Key messages"}, {"text": "\u2022 Differentiate direct patient contact with or without the risk for aerosol generation procedures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Key messages"}, {"text": "The COVID-19 pandemic should not compromise timely reperfusion of STEMI patients.

Risk stratification should be based on the criteria as provided by ESC guidelines on NSTE-ACS.
