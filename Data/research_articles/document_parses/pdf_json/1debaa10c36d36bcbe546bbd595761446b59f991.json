Based on this situation, this paper aims to study the relationships of seat configuration-social distance-air flow-droplet dispersions. The analysis was based on the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) using lattice-Boltzmann model (LBM). The result confirms that by modifying public space configuration in this case by providing more space and increasing seating distance can reduce the vulnerability towards droplet dispersions.",

            "text": "factors namely turbulent jets and flow-induced particle dispersion. Since the transmission is function of physical properties, then flow physics is central to study the transmission. The public spaces including classroom, restaurant, and even transportation cabin are experiencing flow phenomena and this make those places prone to the droplet dispersions. A research by Lu et al. (2020) have studied how the crowded public space in this case a restaurant can be a potential space of droplet dispersion facilitated by air conditioned ventilation system. Virus transmission is a function of environment attributes including air flow. Meaning to say, the transmission cannot be explained by droplet dispersion alone. Whereas, the droplet has dispersion limitations and travel in short distance only. Larger respiratory droplets (>5 \u03bcm) remain in the air for only a short time and travel only short distances generally <1 m. In fact according to droplet dispersion in a restaurant, the distance of infected person and persons at other tables were all >1 m beyond the travel distance range of the droplets. Whereas, the droplet can travel long distance >1 m because it was propagated by the air flow from the air conditioned ventilation system. Following the restaurant based dispersion case discussed above, Li et al. (2020) have applied CFD to model the correspondent air flow and dispersion. Based on the model, they found that the dispersion was related to air flow, crowd, and even seating duration in a space when the infected person was present. Most of current studies on the relationships of people-seating configuration-air flow-droplet dispersion were not based on model yet. If there is a model, a modified model based scenario including increasing the seating distance or even adding protective structure is still limited. Likewise, this paper aims to model the relationships of people-seating configuration-air flow-droplet dispersion in indoor public space settings. Air flow model used in this study is based on computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. Methodology The analysis in this study consist 2 steps. First analysis emphasized on air flow that contain CFD using in this study is a two dimensional flow model. Initially the particle is flowing across a linear barrier and in this study the barriers are the seating configuration. The presence of chair and added with the protective shield is hypothetically can divert the flow and create vortices. A control and intervention scenarios have been prepared to analyze whether the seating scenarios can reduce the spread of droplets.",

Another issue is to maintain the heating, ventilation, and air condition system and make sure any filtration system to work properly combines with regular cleaning and maintenance.The distance effects on public spaces whether in class room, restaurant, or transportation play fundamental roles in droplet dispersions. One of public space that vulnerable is the educational institution ranging from kindergarten, elementary school, high school to campus.

The most advantage is the model has indicated local areas without ventilation where toxic gases not discharged in time. The notorious of CFD is its ability to model the air flow behavior (Huang and Lin 2014, Pamonpol et al. 2020, Zhang et al. 2016). The air flow becomes important issues since the air may carry and transport hazardous particles including virus particles. According to previous study taken example in restaurant, a transmission was related to the seating arrangement and air flow direction released from nearby air conditioned ventilation unit. A restaurant cluster was observed in 9 people who had been sitting at other tables several metres away near air ventilation. In an indoor space, all people shared one thing in common which is an air from singular source.The transmission risk and droplet dispersion models of seating configuration in public space without distance and even without protection have been clarified through model by team from U. of Oregon. In one model, a droplet released by infected persons and caught in a current of air coming from an air conditioning Indoor CO 2 (ppm) with full, 50%, and 30% seating capacity.",

In fact 94 persons out of 216 persons that were seating closed each other were infected. This study clarifies the advantage of protection that is hypothetically more efficient to provide protection from COVID 19. In this study based on the CFD model, providing shield when seating is proven more effective in providing protection. Mittal et al. (2020) have discussed comprehensively covering the protection based mitigation measures. Basically the shield is categorized as inward protection. In comparison to mask, mask can be categorized as both inward and outward protection since it is wear in the mouth. As inward protection, the shield can provide structure that can block the aerosolized particles that would otherwise be inhaled. Recently, shield like structure has been considered as versatile solution when the social distance and seating configuration are difficult to implement. Seating arrangement in the plane can be an example how increasing seating distance cannot be the option. Airplane manufacturer already equipped the seat with this shield like structure. Even in classroom in some countries already installed a shield screen to protect the students. This study confirms an effective blockage of air flow following shield installment and this comparable to result from another study. The effectiveness of a protective structure to influence the air flow has been studied by Hasan et al. (2016). In their study, a structure in the form of partition placed between beds in health care ward can reduce and even block the air flow (Figure 7).",
