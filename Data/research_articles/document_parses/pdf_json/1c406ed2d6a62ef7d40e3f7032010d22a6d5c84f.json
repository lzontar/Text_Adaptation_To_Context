In adults, ALF is defined as onset of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks of signs of hepatic dysfunction, i.e., jaundice and coagulopathy [1] . This definition of ALF in adults cannot be applied directly to children because it is difficult to accurately assess age-appropriate mental status and exact duration of illness in children.

It is characterized by progressive but reversible deterioration of behavior, cognition, and mentation in patients with PALF. The clinical features of hepatic encephalopathy can range from overt coma to irritability to minor changes in behavior and motor or cognitive skills. In children, features of HE can be subtle and difficult to assess and range from mild irritability to inactivity to coma. Table 9 .3 describes the clinical stages of encephalopathy originally developed to assess patients with cirrhosis but is used in ALF for the lack of a better clinical tool. In the Pediatric Acute Liver Failure study group database, the majority of the patients (75%) had grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy, and grade 3 and 4 encephalopathy were seen in 17% and 7% patients, respectively. Out of 348 patients included in this study group, more than half developed hepatic encephalopathy [3] . The exact pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is complex, is not completely understood, and involves a number of interrelated factors [4, 13] . Ammonia is a by-product of nitrogen metab-olism that is generated from the breakdown of glutamine by glutaminase, an enzyme within the enterocytes of the small intestine and colon, and by urease-producing bacteria that inhabit the gut. This gut-derived ammonia enters the urea cycle to be detoxified into urea and excreted in the urine. Ammonia that bypasses this detoxification is converted to glutamine in hepatocytes, skeletal myocytes, and astrocytes in brain. Astrocytes are the most abundant type of cells in the brain. They are very sensitive to a rapid increase in ammonia, which subsequently leads to cellular edema due to increased influx of water secondary to osmotic gradient created by increased intracellular glutamine. Although hyperammonemia has been implicated to play a pivotal role in development of hepatic encephalopathy, a consistent correlation between the plasma concentration of ammonia and clinical manifestation of HE has not been established [14] . In addition to hyperammonemia, increased proinflammatory circulatory cytokines like IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 can modulate cerebral blood flow and cellular permeability to have direct or permissive effects on development and progression of HE into cerebral edema [15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1017, "end": 1020, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1163, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1167, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2140, "end": 2144, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2407, "end": 2411, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 533, "end": 540, "text": "Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Central Nervous System"}, {"text": "Given the potential for rapid neurological deterioration in patients with PALF and HE, early recognition and prompt management of HE are Abnormal, very slow, delta activity necessary to decrease morbidity and mortality in these patients.

Endotracheal intubation for airway protection or controlled ventilation in advanced stages of encephalopathy should be considered. Head of the bed should be elevated to 20-30\u00b0, and the patient's head should be maintained in the midline to provide optimal CSF drainage and jugular venous outflow.

Given the central role of increased arterial ammonia levels in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, one could assume that ammonia-lowering strategies might be effective in halting the progression of neurological deterioration. While the abovementioned agents have a role in preventing progression of HE associated with cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease, there are no controlled trials to support the use of these medications to treat hepatic encephalopathy in ALF [16] [17] [18] .

About 10% of pediatric liver transplants in the USA are performed on children with PALF [6] . Uncontrolled sepsis, certain mitochondrial disorders, and cerebral edema with uncal herniation are contraindications for liver transplant, and the AASLD guidelines for evaluation of a pediatric patient for liver transplantation recommend identifying underlying etiology for PALF to recognize treatable etiologies (Table 9 .4) as well as contraindications for liver transplant [83] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 372, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 751, "end": 755, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 688, "end": 696, "text": "(Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Liver Transplantation"}, {"text": "Liver transplantation for ALF has been associated with inferior outcomes than liver transplantation for chronic liver diseases [84] .

In a recent single-center outcome report on 122 PALF patients who underwent liver transplantation, 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates were 81%, 77%, and 73%, respectively [85] . In the same study, low creatinine clearance and less than 7 days between onset or jaundice and encephalopathy were associated with poor patient survival. Age less than 2 years, low creatinine clearance, and PELD/MELD score greater than 25 were associated with increased graft loss [85] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 127, "end": 131, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 277, "end": 281, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 463, "end": 467, "text": "[85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 751, "end": 755, "text": "[85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Liver Transplantation"}, {"text": "There are several prognostic scoring systems available; however, none of these have been able to well-define the indications for liver transplantation. The King's College Hospital Criteria (KCHC), the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score are among the few most frequently used prognostic scoring systems in adults. However, none of these adequately predict outcome or candidacy for transplantation, and the AASLD guidelines for management of acute liver failure recommend against using these Copper chelation with agents like D-penicillamine, trientene, zinc, etc.; sometimes plasmapheresis may be needed Immune dysregulation Autoimmune hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis serology (see Table 9 .1); elevated Ig G levels IV methylprednisolone while concomitant evaluation for LT Gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD)/ neonatal hemochromatosis High serum ferritin; lip/salivary gland biopsy; characteristic features on MRI brain/liver/ pancreas High-dose IV immunoglobulin; can also be given prophylactic during pregnancy May need exchange transfusion Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) Cytopenias, high serum triglyceride and ferritin, low fibrinogen; high soluble IL-2 receptor, low or absent NK cell activity; genetic testing and/or bone marrow biopsy proved to be diagnostic for organ allocation [17] . Prognostic scoring systems for PALF are poorly defined and not adequately validated. The KCHC has been extensively used in adult ALF; however, when the PALF study group tried to validate the criteria for use in non-acetaminophen-induced PALF patients, it did not reliably predict chance of survival in PALF, and its sensitivity and positive predictive value were significantly lower than the original study [86] . Serum albumin level, serum bilirubin level, PT-INR, age, and weight have been used in the Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score to predict mortality in children with chronic liver disease [87] . This scoring system has not been validated for use in PALF. The pediatric liver injury unit (LIU) score is an upcoming dynamic scoring system, which incorporates the use of peak values of total bilirubin and PT-INR during hospitalization to stratify patients into low, medium, or high risk of mortality. It may prove to be a beneficial tool for prediction of outcomes in PALF and thus the need for liver transplantation [88, 89] .
