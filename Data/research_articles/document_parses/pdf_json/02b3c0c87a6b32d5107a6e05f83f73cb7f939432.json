Beginning in the 1970s with the reinsurance of research in group testing, methodology for accounting for misclassification was proposed. The idea is that even if a test on a single sample has little or no misclassification, it is natural to think that there may be measurement error induced by the combining of samples across individuals. Graff and Roeloffs (1972) 17 21 characterized the optimal design in the Dorfman procedure in the presence of non-differential misclassification by maximizing the ratio between the expected number of correct classifications and the expected number of tests. Using the same criterion and testing procedure, they also characterized a cut-off point of disease prevalence where all individuals should be tested Many recent papers assume non-differential misclassification. Specifically, they assume that misclassification does not depend on the size of the group and that there is misclassification for a single test. Although the assumption of non-differential misclassification may be reasonable for some types of sample pooling, it cannot be generally assumed. Further, misclassification needs to be defined relative to a gold standard. A natural comparison of group testing screening designs is with a design where individuals are tested separately. In many cases, it is reasonable to assume that the assay tested on a single sample is the gold standard. In this case, misclassification for group testing will be relative to single testing with the sensitivity and specificity of the individual test being 1, as it also was assumed earlier by Hwang (1976a) 18 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 525, "end": 550, "text": "Graff and Roeloffs (1972)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 551, "end": 553, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 554, "end": 556, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1767, "end": 1780, "text": "Hwang (1976a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1781, "end": 1783, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TESTING WITH MISCLASSIFICATION AND COMPARISON WITH SINGLE TESTING"}, {"text": "As can be seen from the previous section, many works have appropriately attempted to account for misclassification for the optimal group testing design for disease identification.

By estimated sensitivity, we refer to the value to which the sensitivity would converge in a large sample validation study. From the results, we see that the unconstrainted optimization, which considers only the expected number of tests, often yields very poor estimated overall sensitivity. This highlights the fact that such an optimization procedure can do nothing to control the overall sensitivity rates and should be used cautiously, particularly with differential misclassification. While the overall sensitivity values are always much higher when using the constrained procedure, when the assumed sensitivity function overestimates the true values the chosen group size can yield an overall sensitivity value much smaller than is assumed to be true. The large differences observed between true and estimated sensitivity tend to decrease sharply as increases.

Furthermore, in order to make informed decisions about an optimal group size it would be necessary to first understand how the sensitivity changes with the pool size.

This could be achieved by collecting samples from all women, identifying those with high risk HPV subtypes (i.e., those that act as cancer precursors), and finally administering methylation testing for the high risk HPV group. Those with positive methylation tests would then be followed more intensely to ascertain cervical cancer risk. Using 2010 population estimates and estimated prevalences from 2014 28 , we could approximate that around 20 million women in the US would test positive for a high risk HPV subtype and we would like to design a group testing procedure to screen each of these women using methylation testing. To date, there are no population based estimates of methylation positive testing rates so we will assume a value of 5% for this example. Using these values and the validation procedure outlined above, if the underlying sensitivity function were the linear function ( ) = 1 \u2212 0.02( \u2212 1) then we would require a validation sample size of 31,679 and a total of 92.789 tests with a required population size to see a benefit from group testing of 147,238.

In such cases, smaller validation studies could potentially make group testing feasible in a wider range of settings.

The validation study design assumes that sample is collected from a random sample of individuals from the population at hand and groups of varying size be randomly formed from these samples. There are different alternative designs for the validation sample that may lead to efficiency gains in some situations. For example, if we assume that the specificity is 1 for all group sizes (here, we assumed it was necessary to estimate these specificities in order to confirm this in our calculations), we may save resources by never grouping all negative samples together. Alternatively, rather than attempt to find the optimal design, we could simply evaluate the properties of a group testing design for a single fixed group size. If the false negative rate is too high, we could sequentially evaluate the properties for a smaller group size. This approach may be advantageous for the COVID-19 example, where it is more important to obtain a good design quickly than to spend more time to find the optimal design (i.e., the perfect is the enemy of the good).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "An additional assumption we have made is that the underlying population is homogeneous with respect to the primary trait of interest.

The impact of heterogeneity will include additional challenges to determine the size of the validation sample and to ensure a feasible solution to the optimization problem (1). The issue is that even under the perfect test setting, we need to determine not only group sizes but also the members of the groups and number of such possibilities (number of the partition of the population) is astronomical even for the small population size. In fact, under error-free testing, the optimal partition is known only for the Dorfman procedure 23, 24 .

However, this clearly is not generally true. For example, if misclassification is not considered, the optimal design based on the expected number of tests would be to test all samples in one group, and call all individuals in the group as positive for the disease if the group test is positive, and negative otherwise.

He calculated the expected cost under the Dorfman procedure in the presence of the dilution effect and derived the optimal group sizes to minimize this cost.
