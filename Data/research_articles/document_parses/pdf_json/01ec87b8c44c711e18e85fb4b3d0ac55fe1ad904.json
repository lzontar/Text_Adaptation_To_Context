University-affiliated clinical research was deemed \"nonessential.\" Research staff went home for months. Clinical research studies were essentially abandoned, with data uncollected on ongoing studies and recruitment suspended for new studies. Now, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2 we are all participants in an unwanted natural experiment on the effects of loneliness and isolation. Older adults with physical, cognitive, or psychiatric comorbidities are an important part of clinical research. However, their vulnerability is particularly acute presently as we are facing a critical turning point in the US response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Extreme social distancing (\"social suppression\") is likely to be the most effective tool in preventing the United States from following the recent trajectories documented in Italy and Spain, 3, 4 but it will have a disproportionately negative impact on older adults. On one hand, if we are unable to decrease the rate of progression of the pandemic (\"flatten the curve\"), our healthcare system will become overwhelmed, and older adults are those at greatest risk for death from the direct effects of infection. 4, 5 On the other hand, social suppression puts older adults at risk for mental and physical adverse effects from social isolation. 6 All of this is occurring alongside a reduction in access to physical and mental care, and with a sustained exposure to uncertainty and fear.",

Today, these researchers have to make decisions on how to keep research participants and staff safe, and not contribute to the spread of the virus. At the same time, university and hospitals are enacting new policies regarding clinical research every day. These policies are becoming increasingly restrictive, evolving in a matter of days from \"business as usual: wash your hands and screen for symptoms\" to \"research not essential for participants' health should be postponed indefinitely.\" One bright spot in the otherwise bleak landscape of social distancing has been the relatively rapid approval of telehealth platforms for clinical care. 7, 8 The same technology could be used to continue or initiate new research studies focused on cognitive and mental aspects of health. However, it remains to be seen how institutional review boards (IRBs) will be able to handle this new development. Our conversations with clinical research colleagues across the country suggest that most of us have been caught offguard by this rapidly evolving situation. What principles should we follow?",

Clinical researchers should lead these changes and partner with funders and IRBs to assist in developing language for necessary reports (eg, \"During the COVID-19 outbreak, we switched all contact to telephone and e-mail, for participant safety\"). At the time of this article's publication, we are aware of several university IRBs (including the IRB of Washington University in St. Louis) that have already taken this stance.

The promotion of social distancing leads to wariness and mistrust, and it amplifies negative emotional states associated with these feelings. Isolation in this context has a measurable impact not only on quality of life but also on medical outcomes. 18, 19 Human beings have evolved to crave and seek connection throughout their life, starting at birth. 20 In childhood, lack of connection impacts brain development permanently, and it can lead to life-threatening failure to thrive. Touch is the most effective intervention for activating positive biological markers of connection. 21 However, brief bouts of undivided, direct, and reciprocal eye contact, 22,23 even done remotely, 24 can be as effective at mobilizing biological connection responses in the brain.

It will not be the last regional, national, or international disruption that affects day-to-day life, and we need to learn to be better prepared. 27 Clinical research needs to be pragmatic and resilient, and it needs to be flexible. Clinical research studies should have the ability to adapt to such disruptions. Clinical researchers have an obligation to implement and measure the feasibility and scalability of new approaches, as well as the impact of these new approaches on participants and communities. These data will provide the basis for new guidelines on how to conduct research during time of crises. Disaster plans and contingencies should be included in future grant applications and prespecified in research protocols, trial registrations, and standard operating procedures.",

Researchers need a forum to address and overcome nimbly and creatively the disruptions that ensue from natural disasters like global pandemics. We do not believe we have all the answers; we predict that some of our recommendations will change as this situation continues to unfold rapidly. To that end, we offer one of our websites (mhealth.wustl.edu) as a digital forum for the sharing of approaches and ideas. We invite other researchers to share their best practices for continuing clinical research with older adults in these disruptive times.",
