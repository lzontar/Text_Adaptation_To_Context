The nucleolus is composed of complex protein/protein and protein/RNA interactions. It is a target of virus infection with many viral proteins being shown to localize to the nucleolus during infection. Perturbations to the structure of the nucleolus and its proteome have been predicted to play a role in both cellular and infectious disease. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS with bioinformatic analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to investigate whether the nucleolar proteome altered in virus-infected cells. In this study, the avian nucleolar proteome was defined in the absence and presence of virus, in this case the positive strand RNA virus, avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. Data sets, potential protein changes and the functional consequences of virus infection were validated using independent assays. These demonstrated that specific rather than generic changes occurred in the nucleolar proteome in infectious bronchitis virus-infected cells.",

The primary function of the nucleolus is in ribosome biogenesis, regulation of the cell cycle and the response to cell stress [2] . The nucleolus may be formed around hub proteins [1] , depletion of which can result in alterations in nucleolar architecture [3] and possibly function. The roles the nucleolus play outside its traditional function in ribosome biogenesis have only recently come to light, due in a large part to MS-based approaches to elucidating the nucleolar proteome. The first studies of the human nucleolar proteome revealed 271 and 213 proteins, respectively [4, 5] . The most recent edition of the nucleolar proteome database (NOPdb 3.0) identified over 4500 proteins as being resident within the nucleolus under certain conditions; it estimates at least 80% coverage [6] . It is noteworthy that the majority of studies of the nucleolar proteome have been carried out on human HeLa cells, whereas the only other species investigated in depth is Arabidopsis thaliana where 217 proteins with a large degree of conservation between the plant and the human proteomes were found [7] .",

These range from proteins encoded by RNA viruses with purely cytoplasmic replication strategies [9, 10] to DNA viruses with nuclear replication strategies [11] . The nucleolus can change structure in virus-infected cells [12] and this may correspond with a change in proteome [13] . A recent quantitative analysis of the nucleolar proteome isolated from HeLa cells infected with the nuclear replicating DNA virus adenovirus identified 351 proteins, of which 24 proteins showed at least a twofold change in abundance, compared with nucleoli from mock-infected cells [14] . The precise interactions of viruses with the nucleolus are largely unknown [13] , particularly puzzling is the case of the RNA viruses that have cytoplasmic replication strategies [9] . For example, in one such virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the virally encoded nucleocapsid (N) protein localized to the nucleolus in a cell cycle-dependent manner [15] and contained appropriate targeting motifs [16] [17] [18] .",

Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1 as described previously [19] . Nucleolar fractions were prepared 18 h postinfection as described previously [20] and validated by detecting appropriate marker proteins (data not shown). Quantification was performed with MaxQuant version 1.0.7.4 [21] , and was based on 2-D centroid of the isotope clusters within each SILAC pair. The generation of peak list, SILAC-and extracted ion current-based quantitation, calculated posterior error probability and false discovery rate based on the search engine results, peptide to protein group assembly, and data filtration and presentation was carried out using MaxQuant. The derived peak list was searched with the MASCOT search engine (version 2.1.04; Matrix Science, London, UK) against a concatenated database combining 80 412 proteins from International Protein Index human protein database version 3.6 (forward database), and the reversed sequences of all proteins (reverse database). The complete methodology has been described previously [20, 22] . Raw data sets used to generate Supporting Infor-mation Tables 1 and 2 (described below) can be found on the PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database [23] and were uploaded using the PRIDE database convertor tool [24] .",

However, this database had poor annotation compared with the human genome, and many of the proteins were unassigned or uncharacterized. Therefore, the human database was used for protein assignment from peptide identification. In addition, candidate proteins were then examined to determine whether they were previously identified in the human nucleolar proteome database, which contains some 4500 proteins with an estimated 80% coverage. Only if both of these criteria were met was the protein then assigned as being present in the avian nucleolar proteome (Supporting Information Table 2 ). These resulted in a final list of 378 cellular proteins being identified and of these 260 proteins being identified and quantified. One viral protein, the N protein, was identified in the nucleolus with 59.4% coverage (Fig. 1 ). This had not been previously observed in the nucleolus of IBVinfected DF1 cells, possibly because of the difficulties associated with the indirect immunofluorescence detection of nucleolar proteins [25] . Previous overexpression of an EGFPtagged N protein (in the absence of IBV infection) in DF1 cells demonstrated the potential cytoplasmic and nucleolar localization of this protein [17] . No other IBV proteins were detected in the nucleolar fraction, and this analysis demonstrated the nucleolar localization of N protein in the context of IBV-infected cells.",

Selection of these proteins depended primarily on available antibody but also to demonstrate the validity of the SILAC LC-MS/MS analysis for several different cases: Proteins identified by multiple peptides showing either no significant change (HSP70, 1.38fold increase, identified by 14 peptides) or a significant change (HSP90, 4.30-fold increase, five peptides), to a protein identified by a single peptide and large increase (Shroom3 $50-fold increase). In IBV-infected cells, there was no apparent change in HSP70, whereas HSP90 appeared to have increased punctate localization in the nucleolus, nucleus and cytoplasm. In IBV-infected cells, the nucleolar localization of Shroom3 appeared to increase. Therefore, in general, the indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analysis reflected the observations of the SILAC LC-MS/MS analysis.",

The more recent investigation of the nucleolar proteome in adenovirus-infected cells compared with mock-infected cells using SILAC coupled to LC-MS/MS as well 2-D gel electrophoresis used a cutoff of twofold to access significant differences. In our study, a 2.0-fold cutoff was also used as a basis for investigating potential proteome changes using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis in order to provide comparison with the previous studies. Selection of a twofold difference gave 179 proteins that showed differences in abundance between nucleoli isolated from IBV-infected cells from nucleoli isolated from mock-infected cells. Despite this, not all nucleolar proteins changed in IBV-infected DF-1 cells. For example, the nucleolar proteins nucleolin and NOP56 and NOP58 were not significantly increased in IBV-infected cells with 1.8-fold, 1.2-and 1.5-fold differences, respectively.",

This technique was independent of purification of proteins from the nucleolus and thus provided distinct validation of LC-MS/MS data. Functional predictions such as cell cycle aberrations could be made in terms of bioinformatic analysis of the nucleolar proteome and this was validated using an appropriate assay.

The shapes are indicative or the molecular class (i.e. protein family). Proteins highlighted in grey shading were identified in the LC-MS/MS analysis. Proteins highlighted in clear were not identified in the LC-MS/MS analysis but were linked to the identified protein by examination of the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis curated database describing protein:protein interactions. Examples such as cyclin A are present in the human nucleolar proteome [6], whereas retinoblastoma (Rb) is not, but may never the less be linked to nucleolar pathways as suggested. Lines connecting the molecules indicate molecular relationships. There are two line styles: dashed lines indicate indirect interactions and solid lines indicate direct interactions. The style of the arrows indicates specific molecular relationships and the directionality of the interaction (X acts on Y). (B) Analysis of the proportion of cells in different stages of the cell cycle in mock at 0 h (dark grey shade) and 24 h (clear) and IBV-infected cells at 24 h (light grey). Also shown are examples of raw data output for the cell cycle analysis based on staining with BrdU/PI or PI only.",
