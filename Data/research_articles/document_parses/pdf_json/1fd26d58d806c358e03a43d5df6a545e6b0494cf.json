The Fujii study that presented negative results and was published in JAMA well before the submission of this manuscript was not mentioned in the manuscript. The findings of the primary outcome in the CITRIS study should be described first. Besides, two recent meta-analysis were recommended for relevant backgrounds. REPLY: Thank you for your suggestion. We studied the comment carefully and made a large correction based on your comments. Firstly, we deleted a lot of unnecessary description of literature. Secondly, we have read the Fujii study, which investigated the combined therapy of vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine. Actually, another reference (Ref 29 in the previous draft) cited in this manuscript, which also investigated the combination of these three drugs, was considered as weak evidence to support using VC, and should be deleted suggested by the reviewer 2. The reason is that it is difficult to distinguish which of the components take effects in such a combination therapy. Thus, we deleted the reference 29, as what the reviewer 2 suggested, and did not cite the Fujii study as well.",

Why is only active kidney stone mentioned but not other kidney diseases in the exclusion criteria? REPLY: Thank you for your question. The existed severe kidney diseases are also needed to exclude. This is what we did right now. We determined the exclusion criteria initially based on the report from JAMA in which only active kidney stone was excluded (ref 38 of the revised version). In addition, active kidney stone is a specific side effect of a long-term use of high-dose vitamin C infusion which has been confirmed by the drug instructions, and no any other kidney diseases are listed as side effects in the instructions for vitamin C. However, the drug instructions remind that vitamin C infusion should be applied with caution when patients are with oxalate nephropathy and other severe kidney injury. Actually, we didn't take any patients with existed severe kidney injury in our study. We will add this in our exclusion criterion (page 7).",

Both occur during a subject's participation in research and do not have to be a causal relationship with the treatment.

Power calculation should be based on the primary endpoint. However, since this trial began at the early stage of COVID-19, such data are lacked. Thus, we considered three available variables when calculating the sample size: ICU mortality (13.57%), the rate of noninvasive ventilation (41.7%), and the rate of invasive ventilation (47.22%). We used the non-inferiority test formula to calculate the sample size with a one-sided type error rate (\u03b1) of 2.5%, a power of 80% and a 10% withdrawal rate in each group according to the three variables respectively. Finally, we chose the largest number, namely 308 which was calculated through ICU-mortality (13.57), as the sample size of this trial. However, the calculated sample size is not accurate. Thus, we arrange an interim analysis for a second stage of calculation. After 50 patients are enrolled and their clinical data including 28-days follow-up visits are collected, we will conduct a complete statistical analysis and get relatively accurate sample size. We think we can get the preliminary data after we have enrolled 50 patients (n=25), and then can revise the sample size based on the preliminary data. We added the explanation in page 9-10.",

P6, lines 15-21not sure this trial (ref 29) should be included as was not vitamin C monotherapy, but rather a combination treatment so not possible to tell which of the components was having what effects. P 6, line 41-42 -\"This study showed that higher dosages of VC should be applied\"the findings of this trial cannot be used to say that higher doses of VC are requiredthis is not a valid conclusion. P 6, line 47 \"With the very positive results of previously performed clinical trials\" -I am not sure this is a valid statement eithershould be less strongly worded as outcomes not definitivemany meta-analyses have been carried out with different conclusions. P 9,lines 54-57. There should only be one primary outcomethe one on which the power calculations were based. These three outcomes are quite different, therefore, two of them should be secondary outcomes eg CRP could be included in the 3rd secondary outcome ie changes of plasma biomarkers of inflammation. It also looks like ventilation days has been included as a secondary outcome (point #6). Also, the primary and secondary outcomes don't match what is on clinicaltrials.gov. P10 line 32see point above about participant number in the paper vs what is on clinicaltrials.gov. P11, lines 28-30define abbreviations.",
