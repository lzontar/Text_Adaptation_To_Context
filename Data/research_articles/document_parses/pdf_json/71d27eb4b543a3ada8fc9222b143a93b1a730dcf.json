In today's digital world, it is possible for consumers and the general public to offer their views and opinions across social media platforms. One of the most open platforms to converse about public health is Twitter, where it is also possible to extract tweets for academic research purposes. Previous research has utilised Twitter to identify public views, key discussions, content, and stakeholders related to health scares [13] [14] [15] . Twitter can be used to study and understand the context of the current e-cigarette health scare. Twitter is an important platform to study because it has the potential to shape mainstream news because tweets can be embedded in online news stories, as well as highlighted in traditional media (such as TV or radio), amplifying their reach. Health scares need to be studied in the context in which they occur, and one method of studying them is through the use of Twitter [10, 16] . This is because Twitter provides citizens with a platform that permits the rapid sharing of public views and opinions and allows these views to become viral and highly shared, regardless of their factual truth; henceforth, this is an important and significant area to study.

Within our network graph, there was an edge for each \"replies-to\" relationship in a tweet, an edge for each \"mentions\" relationship in a tweet, and a self-loop edge for each tweet that was not a \"replies-to\" or \"mentions\". The graph was directed, and vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore cluster algorithm. The graph was laid out using the Harel-Koren fast multiscale layout algorithm. Figure 1 below shows a social network analysis of tweets from early October 2019, which relates to a time period when the first academic study was published linking vaping to cancer in mice. Figure 2 is zoomed into Group 2 and labels the influential users within the group. From group 3 onwards we have abbreviated the word 'Group' to 'G'. The network graph highlights that there were different clusters of discussion taking place on Twitter during this time with two large groups and several smaller groups indicating a number of communities that had emerged related to this topic. The ten largest groups were labelled. There was also a sizeable isolates group (Group 1), which indicated that a number of Twitter users were tweeting about e-cigarettes without mentioning or replying to other Twitter users. In Figure 2 , we zoom into Group 2 in which discussions were formed around a number of influential user accounts such as President Donald Trump, the World Health Organisation, and Fox News. Alongside this network graph, we were also able to identify the most frequently used words, hashtags, websites, and most influential users in the network, which are described below. Table 1 below displays the most frequently occurring words during this time period. It highlights that mentions of e-cigarettes were made in conjunction with the scientific work that linked them to cancer. The most frequently occurring words in Group 1 are displayed in Table 2 below. Here, it can also be seen that many of these words centred on the news story linking vaping to cancer. The most frequently occurring words in Group 2 (the second largest cluster of Twitter users) are highlighted in Table 3 below. It is important to note that the word-count numbers listed above would also contain hashtags that used those words. These words in Group 2 highlighted the polarisation on Twitter as certain hashtags were against the idea of any restrictions on vaping by governments, and Twitter users expressed this through the use of the hashtag \"#wevapewevote\", whereas those against e-cigarettes would use hashtags such as \"#vapeban\".", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 186, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 602, "end": 610, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 793, "end": 801, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1421, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1782, "end": 1789, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 2052, "end": 2059, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2282, "end": 2289, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "The most frequently occurring hashtags overall are summarized in Table 4 below.

The study was tweeted by several mainstream media outlets and dominated discussions of e-cigarettes on Twitter. The study, however, was questioned by several experts as they noted that the study conducted on mice could not be generalised to humans. Our study highlighted the impact of academic research on Twitter when it is disseminated through the mainstream media. The publication of the study caused great concern over the safety of e-cigarettes on Twitter, and users of the platform were quick to point out that e-cigarettes were still a much safer alternative to traditional smoking. For instance, health authorities such as the National Health Service in the United Kingdom still noted that e-cigarettes contained a fraction of the risk when compared to that of traditional cigarettes [19] . However, the publication of the study linking cancer to mice may have incorrectly been interpreted and understood by some members of the public who would now believe that e-cigarettes were just as unsafe and/or more unsafe when compared to traditional tobacco based cigarettes. Current advice provided by Centers for Disease Control [20] [21] [22] notes that e-cigarettes are likely to be safer than smoking traditional cigarettes. Our recommendation to health authorities is to offer guidance to the public in order for citizens to make informed decisions about whether e-cigarettes are safe to consume. A key aspect of assessing whether vaping is safe depends on whether an individual is already engaged in using traditional cigarettes and/or rolled tobacco products. However, information disseminated to consumers around the safety of e-cigarettes can be confusing and vague. Moreover, we found that Twitter users tended to be unsure about the safety of e-cigarettes. Henceforth, based on a review of the literature and the advice provided by the Centers for Disease Control, the National Health Service (NHS), and Cancer Research UK [20] [21] [22] , we developed a flowchart, as shown in Figure 3 , that could be utilised by consumers and medical professionals when making a decision about whether e-cigarettes are likely to be safe or unsafe based on their circumstances. By analysing public comments on Twitter, we were able to identify potential points of confusion by consumers, and combining our results with that of current medical advice led to the development of the flowchart above. Social media may be a source of information for a subset of the population, and it is important to analyse this information from a public health surveillance perspective. Our findings can also be contrasted with previous empirical work in this area. A study published in 2018 [23] conducted an analysis of e-cigarette discussions on Twitter from 2012 to 2015, which examined the reasons for using such devices. The study found that one of the most popular reasons for using e-cigarettes was to quit traditional cigarettes, and Twitter users were positive towards e-cigarette devices. Moreover, they found that 43% of Twitter users were able to give up traditional cigarettes, which demonstrated the potential of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation. The findings of this study were similar to our present study, which also found that there was a sizeable \"pro-vaping\" community on Twitter. A further study [24] published in 2014 looked at a specific case study containing tweets for and against public health policy related to the Chicago Department of Public Health. This study also found pro-and anti-e-cigarette views such as that they promote smoking cessation, but also that they are harmful and foster nicotine addiction. A further study in the United Kingdom [25] surveyed 3538 current and 579 recent smokers in November and December 2012. It was also found that there were mixed views among the public about whether e-cigarettes were more or less harmful than traditional cigarettes, with a number of citizens unsure of their safety at the time. These results further highlight the need for easy-to-understand guidance for consumers, and our flowchart developed above will be of interest to health authorities.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 887, "end": 891, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1231, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1236, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1237, "end": 1241, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2031, "end": 2035, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2040, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2041, "end": 2045, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2766, "end": 2770, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3394, "end": 3398, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3754, "end": 3758, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2086, "end": 2094, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This paper conducted an analysis of current debates surrounding e-cigarette usage on Twitter.
