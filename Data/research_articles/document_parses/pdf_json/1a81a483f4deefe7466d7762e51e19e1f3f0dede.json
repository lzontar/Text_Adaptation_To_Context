The prevalence of cryptosporidia, potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Clostridium perfringens was similar in normal or diarrhoeic foals. Rotaviruses had a similar prevalence in all age groups of scouring foals up to three months of age, with an overall prevalence of 37 per cent among diarrhoeic foals. The number of cases of diarrhoea varied considerably from year to year, but in all three years of the survey rotavirus was a significant pathogen. A comparison of diagnostic tests for rotavirus in the faeces showed electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to have similar sensitivity. The Rotazyme ELISA test kit was found to have the same sensitivity as a combination of EM and PAGE. A. hydrophila had an overall prevalence of 9 per cent among diarrhoeic foals, although its prevalence was higher in some age groups. A. hydrophila has not been established previously as a significant enteric pathogen in foals. Other putative pathogens found at very low prevalence were coronavirus, the putative picobirnavirus, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. No evidence was found of synergistic effects between rotavirus, cryptosporidia and potentially pathogenic E. coli.

", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Significance of co-infection (Table 4 )"}, {"text": "This study confirms the importance of Group A rotaviruses in causing diarrhoea in young foals. Previous surveys have found rotaviruses in the faeces of diarrhoeic foals in Britain (Flewett, Bryden and Davies 1975) , the United States (Kanitz 1976; Conner and Darlington 1980) , Australia (Studdert, Mason and Patten 1978) , New Zealand (Durham, Stevenson and Farquharson 1979) , Ireland (Strickland, Lenihan, O'Connor and Condon 1982) , Japan (Imagawa et a1 1984a) and Germany (Herbst et a1 1987) . The proportion of diarrhoeic foals excreting rotavirus has varied considerably between different studies, from 11 per cent (Herbst et a1 1987) to 62 per cent (Gillespie et a1 1984) , but most studies have implicated rotavirus in 30 to 40 per cent of cases of diarrhoea in foals, which generally supports our observations. Dwyer et a1 (1988) detected rotavirus in 3.1 per cent of 1602 samples from normal foals, and in 26.4 per cent of 269 samples from diarrhoeic foals. Our observations, therefore, confirm the highly significant association between rotavirus infection and diarrhoea, and suggest that rotaviruses are probably responsible for at least a third of all cases. Also, experimental infection of foals with equine rotaviruses induced diarrhoea (Imagawa et a1 1984b; Higgins ef a1 1988; Browning, Chalmers, Scott and Snodgrass unpublished data). Previous surveys have not recorded the age distribution of rotaviruses. Our survey indicates that rotaviruses are significant pathogens throughout the first 3 months of a foal's life, although they may be responsible for a greater proportion of cases of diarrhoea in foals aged one to two months. There were comparatively few cases of diarrhoea in foals aged less than one week or more than 2 months. As most foals remained on the studfarms from birth until 3 months of age this distribution is unlikely to be due to sampling bias. Foals aged less than 1 week probably gained passive protection against enteric infection from the higher concentrations of antibody in colostrum and milk bathing the gut. Foals older than 2 months as well as being more tolerant of upper intestinal insult due to development of colonic function, might have developed active immunity as a result of sub-clinical infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 213, "text": "(Flewett, Bryden and Davies 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 234, "end": 247, "text": "(Kanitz 1976;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 248, "end": 275, "text": "Conner and Darlington 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 288, "end": 321, "text": "(Studdert, Mason and Patten 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 336, "end": 376, "text": "(Durham, Stevenson and Farquharson 1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 387, "end": 434, "text": "(Strickland, Lenihan, O'Connor and Condon 1982)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 443, "end": 464, "text": "(Imagawa et a1 1984a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 622, "end": 641, "text": "(Herbst et a1 1987)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 657, "end": 679, "text": "(Gillespie et a1 1984)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 477, "end": 496, "text": "(Herbst et a1 1987)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The variation in the total number of rotavirus cases each year also was reflected in the month of peak prevalence; the greater the number of annual cases, the earlier the month of peak prevalence. This probably reflects the relative concurrence of high levels of exposure in a population of susceptible animals. When environmental contamination occurs early in the season, a greater exposure to rotavirus is present when the maximum number of susceptible foals are on the studfarm (AprilFlay). Two studies (Conner and Darlington 1980; Traub-Dargatz et a1 1988) noted an association between the introduction of foals to studfarms and epidemics of rotavirusassociated diarrhoea, but it was not established whether the epidemic resulted from introduction of a new strain or multiplication and dissemination of an endemic strain. The considerable movement of stock between studs and the observation that many stud farms are affected concurrently in years of higher prevalence, suggests that epidemics are probably caused by increased levels of contamination rather than introduction of new strains. The association with introduction might be related more to the stress of transport and its effect on general levels of immunity, and also reduced ingestion of the mare's milk during and/or after transport resulting in lowered passive protection. Although the ability of milk antibody to protect foals from rotavirus infections has not been established, vaccination of the dam has been used successfully to protect calves from rotavirus diarrhoea by increasing the amount of antirotavirus antibody in the milk (Snodgrass 1986 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 506, "end": 534, "text": "(Conner and Darlington 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 535, "end": 560, "text": "Traub-Dargatz et a1 1988)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1604, "end": 1619, "text": "(Snodgrass 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "No significant difference was found between the sensitivity of ,EM and PAGE for rotavirus diagnosis. Similarly, no significant difference could be found between the sensitivity of diagnosis by both EM and PAGE and the Rotazyme ELISA kit, assuming the ELISA to be 100 per cent specific. However, it is apparent from these results that any survey based on only one of these diagnostic methods will seriously underestimate the true prevalence of rotavirus infections. The lack of an absolute standard against which to compare these assays hampers interpretation the estimates of sensitivity. Because the structural morphology and the segmented double stranded RNA genome of rotaviruses are characteristic, it is reasonable to assume that EM and PAGE approach 100 per cent specificity, but it is not possible to assume this unreservedly for an ELISA test.

Three agents warrant further consideration. A. hydrophila has been isolated from diarrhoeic foals (Tzipori 1985 ), but has not been shown to be a significant pathogen in foals prior to this study. It may have been responsible for up to 9 per cent of all cases, and further focussed study of its epidemiology appears worthwhile, particularly of the trend observed for higher prevalence in foals aged 1 week to 2 months in which it might have been responsible for as many as 16 per cent of all diarrhoea cases. The evaluation of enterotoxin production by A. hydrophila from diarrhoeic foals may be of value in future investigations because enterotoxigenic A. hydrophila are a common cause of prolonged diarrhoea in human infants (Burke et a1 1983) . Second, cryptosporidia, although not shown to be significantly more prevalent in diarrhoeic foals, still warrants attention because of its high prevalence and its potential activity as a copathogen in mixed infections (Tzipori 1985) .
