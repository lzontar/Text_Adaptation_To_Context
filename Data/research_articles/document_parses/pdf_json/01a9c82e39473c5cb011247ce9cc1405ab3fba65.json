Models are needed to understand the implications of possible relaxation options of these measures. We report such models, together with corresponding parameter estimation techniques and prediction outcomes, borrowing insights from another domain; namely, information cascades. Our models assume that containment of the virus into isolated locales is no longer possible. Instead, we explore options that reduce its rate of spread. We predict COVID-19 contagion trends in different geographic regions under a \"what if\" scenario to understand the effects of potential policy decisions on regional trends. Our model allows experimentation with other policies that, we hope, can contribute to socially viable outcomes both in terms of health system capacity and economic impact. We apply our model to over 30 highly impacted states in the US and publish the results at https://covid19predictions.csl.illinois.edu/ COVID-19 in USA | Epidemic Modeling | Domain Mixing | ...",

In the absence of a specific treatment or vaccines, social distancing becomes the most effective strategy to protect from the virus (2, 3) . Prolonged social distancing has other side-effects, both socially and economically (4, 5) , leading to mounting pressure in the US to relax current policies. It is important to reach a finer-grained understanding of available crisis management options that minimize side-effects but do not overwhelm the health system.",

Information (similarly to viral contagion) propagates through broadcast channels. In the information space, a broadcast channel might be a Facebook wall, online subreddit, or virtual \"hangout\". These virtual spaces create opportunities for information transmission among individuals who frequent them. In the world of viral contagion, physical spaces, such as stores, offices, public transport, and family residences, serve the role of broadcast channels. We shall henceforth call them, social mixing domains. Social distancing policies manipulate the availability of some of these domains. Information cascade models predict what happens to propagation when the underlying broadcast channels are manipulated. Leveraging this analogy, we capture the effects of a wide playbook of social distancing options on contagion dynamics. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 puts our model in the context of related work. Section 3 summarizes the main result and significance of the work. Section 4 elucidates the concept of mixing domains. Section 5 describes mixing domain parameter estimation, and presents the key analysis results and predictions. We conclude our paper in section 6.",

            "text": "The work is new in developing a mesoscopic epidemiological model in which the fundamental abstraction is neither the individual agent (node) nor an entire community, but rather an element in between: a single broadcast channel or mixing domain. These domains vary in prevalence from small units such as individual households (of which there are many) to very large units such as concerts, malls, and large gatherings. Often popularity or size distribution of human and social artifacts follows standard profiles, such as Zipf Law (7), resulting on the same striking statistical distribution regularity in fields as diverse as linguistics (8, 9) , urban populations (10, 11) , business income distributions (12) , and the Internet (13) . Recent executive orders in the US, in effect, manipulate the distribution of these domains by closing or reopening some of them. For example, closing all venues larger than a given threshold will effectively remove the tail of the size distribution. Our mesoscopic model, therefore allows us to link social distancing policy decisions to the distribution of remaining available mixing domains, which in turn allows estimating future viral spread. The work aims to inform decision-making on crisis mitigation policies.",

A recent survey D R A F T discusses these existing models and the corresponding cascade mitigation policies they allow (14) . On one hand, agent-centric models (15) (16) (17) (18) start with the behavior of individual agents, as well as their connectivity graphs. They enable reasoning about fine-grained mitigation strategies, such as inoculation of specific agents to reduce disease spread. Agent-based models can also be used for detailed simulations to understand the impact of a large variety of detailed interventions. While very powerful and versatile, they require inputs that are difficult to collect, such as the interaction graph of all agents in the system. This limitation often renders them less suitable in practice. On the other hand, population-centric models, such as SIR (19) , SEIR (20) , SIS (21) , and SQIS (22) , focus on the total population. They reason about statistics of entire communities, such as the total number of infected, susceptible, and recovered individuals. They can also model high-level mitigation strategies such as inoculation of a specified fraction of the entire community (i.e., their removal from the susceptible list). These models, however, do not offer a clear way of reasoning about impacts of finer grained decisions, such as closure of some fraction of businesses or meeting venues. Macroscopic methods for COVID-19 trend prediction (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) thus lack the ability to forecast effects of different policies.",

In a system, where everyone is restricted to small domains that are perfectly quarantined (for example, restricted to their family residences under strict quarantine), the ratio of infected in the quarantine zone, \u03bai = Ii(t)/I(t), will be disproportionately higher than what domain size might predict this ratio to be (i.e., Ii(t)/I(t) > Ni/N ). Similarly, the same ratio outside the quarantine zone will be lower. In our analysis, however, we assume that strict quarantine is no longer socially viable. Instead, individuals from different domains will mix (in other domains). For example, individuals from different households might mix in the same grocery store or office and individuals from different offices might mix at the same bus stop. (Of course, the opportunities for mixing are constrained by available mixing domains.) We assume that mixing fails to localize infections in any subset of domains, and instead spreads the infection as broadly as possible. The above mixing assumption leads to an important worst-case approximation. Namely, if mixing is perfect, the expected number of susceptible (infected) individuals in a domain is roughly proportional to the size of the domain. More specifically: [14] Ii(t) \u2248 Ni N I(t) [15] We consider this a worst-case approximation because the resulting analysis tends to maximize estimates of total spread. If mixing is imperfect, then virus spread will slow down sooner in more heavily impacted domains (due to scarcity of remaining susceptible individuals), while it will also proceed at a slower rate in other domains (due to scarcity of infected individuals). The worst-case assumption is helpful from the perspective of erring on the safe side. Let us define \u03b1i to be the fraction \u03b1i = Ni/N . From the above, we get: [16] Substituting from Equation (16) into Equations (11), (12) , and (13), we get: [19] where:",

By manipulating some of the domains (e.g., closing them), one can thus reduce the equivalent transmissibility, \u03c4eq, of the disease. For example, reducing the fraction of time, \u03b7i, that is spent in domains with a higher \u03c4i\u03b1 2 i (i.e., bigger domains, where \u03b1i is high) can lead to a reduction in \u03c4eq. Intuitively, this is the motivation for social distancing policies that prevent large meetings, close non-essential businesses, move towards remote instruction, and implement curb-side pickup (e.g., instead of dine-in) alternatives. Now let us break the local population into a set G of nonoverlapping groups. Let \u03b7ij denote the average amount of time that individuals in group gj \u2208 G spend in domain i (some fractions could be zero). Also, let fij be the average fraction of occupancy of domain i who are from group gj, and let \u03c4ij be the probability that an infected person in domain i who encounters a member of group gj successfully infects them (i.e., transmissibility). One can thus approximately rewrite the product \u03c4i\u03b7i as a weighted sum of per-group products: \u03c4i\u03b7i = j\u2208G (\u03c4ij\u03b7ij)fij [21] Substituting from Equation (21) [22] In general, announced social distancing measures might not come into effect immediately. In the model, we may consider an exponential function f (t) by which \u03c4eq changes to \u03c4 eq .

The prediction is shown to match the actual impact of the policy after implementation. \u2021 https://covid19predictions.csl.illinois.edu/ A. Background.. The government of Illinois announced the \"social distancing\" measures on March 21st, 2020, which limits certain social interactions and urges self-quarantine. The policy changes people's mobility and the landscape of COVID-19 spread. We refer to Google Mobility Report \u00a7 , US Bureau of Labor Statistics \u00b6 and US Census Bureau \u2016 , for the total population, total labor force, and mobility trends of Retail & Recreation, Grocery & Pharmacy, Parks, Transit stations, Workplaces and Residential in Illinois. We also assume that only the employed people will be exposed in workplace domain, and every citizen in Illinois will be exposed to other five domains. Overall, the computed fraction before and after the policy is \u03c4 eq /\u03c4eq = 0.7829.",

We apply our model on the cumulative confirmed cases in Illinois starting from the date when the confirmed cases are larger than 10, which is March 10th, 2020. In the experiment, regular SIR and our broadcast SIR are compared for two scenarios. The first evaluation emphasizes the \"what-if\" condition. We try to present how well our model could predict after social distancing measures. Both models are trained before March 21st (the policy announcement) and predict for the next two weeks afterwards. Secondly, we compare the prediction accuracy using one-week data as test (April 07th -April 13rd) and the rest of the history (March 10th -April 06th) as training. For our model, we provide pessimistic Prediction, where \u03c4 eq /\u03c4eq = 0.7829, as computed above, and optimistic Prediction, where we assume closure of all non-necessary businesses and transportation (i.e., the occupancy for retail & recreation, parks, and transit stations are set to 0, grocery & pharmacy is cut by half). In the latter case, \u03c4 eq /\u03c4eq = 0.5668. An average prediction is taken as their average.",

The training data consists of a 12-day time series, and social distancing happens on March 21st. Each curve fits the ground truth data well during the training period. Since regular SIR model is agnostic to the policy, it (blue curve) increases exponentially and shows the consequences without social distancing. By considering the policy and utilizing external sources, we quantify the change of infectious broadcast domains and generate the pessimistic/optimistic ratio, 0.7829 and 0.5668, respectively. With these two ratios and the mitigation function (in Section B), our domain-specific SIR (pink curve) provides a more realistic and relatively accurate prediction.",

From the basic derivation of an SIR model, the above equations roughly assume that each infected individual in Di makes, say, ci encounters in the domain per unit time, of which, therefore, ciSi(t)/Ni are in susceptible population (Si(t)/Ni is the probability of the susceptible in Di) . If the probability of transmission per encounter is \u03c4i, then each infected individual passes the virus to \u03c4iciSi(t)/Ni others, leading to the above questions, where \u03b2i = \u03c4ici. In our analysis, we assume that the number of other encountered individuals in a domain grows with the size of the domain (e.g., one passes more",
