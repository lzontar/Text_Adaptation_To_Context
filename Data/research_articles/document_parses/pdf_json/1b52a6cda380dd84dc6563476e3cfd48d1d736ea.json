As we have observed while working as clinicians and researchers on such wards in Uganda, early identification of evolving critical illness remains challenged by infrequent vital sign monitoring and lack of standardized management practices for patients with severe respiratory distress and sepsis syndromes, a leading cause of ARDS in resource-limited settings [1, 2]. As prompt recognition and aggressive treatment of early clinical deterioration can often prevent illness progression and death, there remains an ongoing need for the development, validation, and implementation of basic triage tools to systematically guide identification and emergent treatment of severely ill patients in such settings. One such tool that is available now is the \"Quick Check\" protocol included in the World Health Organization's Integrated Management of Adolescent and Adult Illness (IMAI) District Clinician Manual. Available as a standalone wall chart and accessible through mobile phone platforms, the \"Quick Check\" offers clinicians in austere environments a rapid, standardized approach to triage and initial management for patients arriving to the health facility [3]. In the \"Quick Check, \" for example, all patients with severe respiratory distress are to be placed on supplemental oxygen while vital signs are collected and indications for other emergent therapies are evaluated (e.g., empiric antimicrobials for patients with fever and judicious volume resuscitation for those with concomitant shock) [3]. In addition, recent data from Uganda suggest that \"early warning\" scores, which allocate points for derangements in vital signs and mental status, can be applied at the bedside to identify hospitalized patients at high risk for decompensation and death from sepsis and other severe illness, thereby providing opportunities for similar targeted interventions [4, 5] .",
