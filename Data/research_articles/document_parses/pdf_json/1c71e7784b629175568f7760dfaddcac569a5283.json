Memorial Hermann Life Flight services an area in Houston, TX, of \u2248150 miles and a population of over 4 million, completing >3,000 missions annually. Following the first patient identified with COVID-19 in Houston on March 1, 2020, the clinical administrative staff at Memorial Hermann's Life Flight air ambulance service was tasked with establishing a guideline for the transport and management of COVID-19",

Flight crew buy-in was felt to be critical in the success of establishing such a protocol. Out-of-hospital providers have been shown to be more comfortable in caring for patients with HCIDs (as seen in the response to the Ebola Virus) when they are provided adequate training on the procedures and transparency from hospital and organizational administration. 16 Challenges Identified in the Creation of the COVID-19 Rotor Wing Guidelines: Early in the process of development of these guidelines, several key areas of focus were identified: (1) dispatch, (2) personal protective equipment (PPE), (3) medical crew arrangement & patient care, (4) aviation operations, and (5) decontamination.",

As mentioned previously, turbulence in the aircraft as well as the limited space increases the risk of exposure to flight crews when patients require potentially aerosol-generating procedures (ie, nebulizer therapy, suctioning, high flow nasal cannula, CPAP, BiPAP, etc).7 Though our guidelines did not mandate intubation of every COVID-19 patient, recommendation was given for patients to be intubated at the sending facility prior to flight if they had the potential for respiratory failure in flight or requirement of the above-mentioned procedures.",

In order to minimize the potential for aborted missions due to weather and unexpected turbulence in flight, it was determined that the COVID-19 patients would be flown solely under visual flight rules (VFR). As part of this operational guideline, VFR minimums were increased to the following, utilizing the standard flight measurement value of statute miles (SM): restrictions and landing zone issues Due to the sensitive nature of these interfacility transports, once patient-loaded, refueling was restricted until after completion of the mission and decontamination of the aircraft. The purpose of the fueling modifications was 2-fold: (1) reducing contact with the general public, and (2) generating a quicker turn-around time at our personal fueling locations. This is important in returning the aircraft to service after a lengthy decontamination process. Hot-loading and offloading were also removed from operational guidelines on the COVID-19 aircraft. Finally, an unexpected barrier to patient care and transport was discovered during the early phases of hospital response to the pandemic in Houston. Many community hospitals were erecting triage field tents in their parking lots. This created a potential hazard for the pilot, as many of these were being placed in the vicinity of the designated helipads. This required detailed reconnaissance of our Houston area helipads and open lines of communication with flight crew on approach",

Although this guideline was intended to focus on interfacility transports for known COVID-19 positive patients and patients under investigation (PUIs), it was recognized that some PUI and COVID-19 patients may not self-identify in this manner. The following list of screening questions was utilized to help identify HCID patients: 1. Does the patient have a temperature \u2265100.1? 2. Does the patient have new onset of coughing? 3. Does the patient have nasal congestion unrelated to allergies? 4. Does the patient have a sore throat? 5. Does the patient have shortness of breath unrelated to chronic disease? 6. Does the patient have new onset of diarrhea? 7. Is the patient living with someone who is under mandated 14-day quarantine for COVID-19 exposure? 8. Does the patient have a known contact with someone with COVID-19?If any answers to the above questions were yes, guidance was given to contact the Chief Flight Nurse in order to dispatch the designated COVID-19 crew.Dispatch plays a critical role in screening and prioritizing the incoming interfacility transfer requests for COVID-19 patients, and those identified as PUIs (persons under investigation). Each request for transport of a COVID-19 or PUI patient is first screened by dispatch, then discussed with the Chief Flight Nurse and Medical Director for both safety and appropriateness. Prioritization is given to higher acuity patients requiring ventilatory support, vasopressor support, and ECMO. The flight medical crew is provided an opportunity to review the patient chart from the sending facility, when available, and to have a phone conversation with the sending medical providers.
