            "text": "Data mining algorithms play an important role in the prediction of early-stage breast cancer. In this paper, we propose an approach that improves the accuracy and enhances the performance of three different classifiers: Decision Tree (J48), Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). We also validate and compare the classifiers on two benchmark datasets: Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) and Breast Cancer dataset. Data with imbalanced classes are a big problem in the classification phase since the probability of instances belonging to the majority class is significantly high, the algorithms are much more likely to classify new observations to the majority class. We address such problem in this work. We use the data level approach which consists of resampling the data in order to mitigate the effect caused by class imbalance. For evaluation, 10 fold cross-validation is performed. The efficiency of each classifier is assessed in terms of true positive, false positive, Roc curve, standard deviation (Std), and accuracy (AC). Experiments show that using a resample filter enhances the classifier's performance where SMO outperforms others in the WBC dataset and J48 is superior to others in the Breast Cancer dataset.",

In 2019, 268,600 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S., along with 62,930 new cases of non-invasive breast cancer [2] . Early detection is the best way to increase the chance of treatment and survivability. Data mining has become a popular tool for knowledge discovery which shows good results in marketing, social science, finance and medicine [19, 20] . Recently, multiple classifiers algorithms are applied on medical datasets to perform predictive analysis about patients and their medical diagnosis [6, 9, 10, 21] . For example, using machine learning techniques to assess tumor behavior for breast cancer patients. One problem is that there is a class imbalance in the training data, since the probability of not having this disease is higher than the one of having it. This paper introduces a comparison between three different classifiers: J48, NB, and SMO with respect to accuracy in detection of breast cancer. Our aim is to prepare the dataset by proposing a suitable method that can manage the imbalanced dataset and the missing values, to enhance the classifier's performance. All tasks were conducted using Weka 3.8. 3 .",

Each time, a single subset is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k\u22121 subsets are used as training data. Three classification techniques were selected: a Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), a Decision Tree built on the J48 algorithm, and a Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). The NB classifier is a probabilistic classifier based on the Bayes rule. It works by estimating the portability of each class value that a given instance belongs to that class [15] . The J48 algorithm [16] uses the concept of information entropy and works by splitting each data attributers into smaller datasets in order to examine entropy differences. It is an improved and enhanced version of C4.5 [17] . The SMO model implements John Platt's sequential minimal optimization algorithm for training a support vector classifiers. This implementation globally replaces all missing values and transforms nominal attributes into binary ones. It also normalizes all attributes by default [18] .",

After that, resample filter was applied for 7 times. The Performance of the classifiers are improved and enhanced as shown in Table 2 . As illustrated in Table 2 , we can obviously notice that the more resample filter we apply, the improved accuracy we obtain. That is because the data is imbalanced and the filter maintains the class distribution. For the Breast cancer dataset, J48 outperforms others with 98.20%. Accuracy measures for J48 classifier is shown in Table 3 and Roc curve of J48 is shown in Fig. 2 . To measure the performance of the proposed model, we compare the obtained results with the study proposed in [9] . The same dataset and three classifiers including J48 algorithm are used to evaluate the model's performance. According to the results, the J48 classifier of the proposed model achieves high accuracy comparing to other classifiers. This is because of using the resample filter for the pre-processing phase in the proposed model rather than feature selection technique that used in [9] as illustrated in Table 4 . ",

With respect to applying preprocessing techniques all algorithms present higher classification accuracy, the difference lies in the fact that using the resample filter several times improves the classification accuracy. SMO classifier achieve 99.56% efficiency compared to 99.12% of the Na\u00efve Bayes and 99.24% of the J48. Results are illustrated in Table 5 . In the WBC dataset, SMO superior than others with 99.56%. Accuracy measures for SMO classifier is shown in Table 6 and Roc curve of SMO is shown in Fig. 3 . In terms of the WBC dataset, our proposed method is compared with two studies [6, 10] . Results shows that the performance of SMO classifier is better since our model employs pre-processing, and resampling approaches. Thus, utilizing pre-processing, and resampling techniques play an important role in increasing the SMO accuracy comparable to the other techniques in [6, 10] . Details are shown below in Table 7 . ",

Breast cancer detection can be done with the help of modern machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we focus on how to deal with imbalanced data that have missing values using resampling techniques to enhance the classification accuracy of detecting breast cancer. In our work, three classifiers algorithms J48, NB, and SMO applied on two different breast cancer datasets. Results show that using the resample filter in the preprocessing phase enhances the classifier's performance. In the future, the same experiments will apply to different classifiers and different datasets.",
