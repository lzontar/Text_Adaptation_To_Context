Healthcare professionals are at the front-line of this crisis and are those who are actively engaged in the process of providing care for patients with COVID-19 while managing critical issues daily (e.g., lack of hospital facilities, personal protection measures, exhausting working hours, fear of contagion and spreading the virus).Most of the reports and studies have examined the obvious negative outcomes on health professionals, such as increased levels of stress, anxiety and depression (Lai et al., 2020) . Vicarious traumatization (VT), secondary traumatic stress (STS), Compassion Fatigue or 'cost of caring' (CF) have all been used interchangeably -despite the nuanced differences-to describe the detrimental effects of being exposed to the trauma reports of others and the empathic engagement with their traumatic experiences. Undoubtedly, the exacerbation of existing or the onset of new mental health symptoms and disorders should be a priority and a serious public concern.",

It is increasingly recognized that a number of personal assets and resources (e.g., communication, social support, coping strategies) are positively associated with either resilience or posttraumatic growth (Palacio et al., 2019) . Recognizing and further strengthening these should be a priority for health professionals. Coordinated and cooperative efforts worldwide should conduct large-scale cross-sectional and longitudinal studies despite the difficulty in accessing and recruiting participants, such as specific professional groups.",

Evidence-based interventions aiming at safeguarding health professionals from the negative effects of the pandemic, while concurrently -and mainly-strengthening their personal assets and resources, are of paramount importance both for the safety of all the parties being involved (i.e., professionals and patients), and the quality of patient care itself. These efforts should be developed amidst the pandemic and be intensified after the pandemic. Tailored-based interventions addressing the specific needs of diverse groups of health professionals are needed. The psychological empowerment of those professionals will guarantee a physically and mentally healthy workforce devoted to high-quality care provision.",

Rather than adopting a loss and deficit framework or a wear hypothesis, a positive salutogenic perspective can and should be applied by all.
