On March 23 rd however, Ben Morris, a resident of Mallorca, made a post that went viral, which, within a week, had been shared over 13,000 times. A collage of photos which had appeared to have been taken by Morris at a local beach shows dozens of single-use face masks washing ashore: a part of the collective detritus of our efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic (see Figure 1 ). Further investigation revealed, however, that Morris had merely cropped and shared the photos, which were not from Mallorca at all, but had rather been captured in late February in the Soko Island's near Hong Kong (Boyle, 2020; OceansAsia, 2020) . Nonethless, the post, its rapid spread, and its confused provenance, are indicative of the power of the image itself, as well as the power of social media to spread information, and misinformation, during a time of crisis.",

Many of these have proven to be fabrications, such as the images of dolphins frolicking in the canals of Venice, but others, like improved air quality in major cities ii and the global decrease in greenhouse gas emissions are both noticeable and verifiable. The other indelible images of this pandemic, have been less eco-friendly, however. With looming uncertainty, and restrictions on movement, the pandemic in many countries has also been characterised by consumption: the stockpiling of supplies, hoarding, and in some instances, panic buying. These more extreme reactions have also been accompanied by more subtle consumption changes: switching to single-use products for hygeine and convenience, using disposable wipes for disinfecting surfaces, carrying small bottles of hand sanitiser, and of course the masks, which may well continue to wash up on shores, either in Mallorca or Hong Kong, long after the pandemic recedes.",

            "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic is a disaster on a global scale, and in addition to its human impact, it will produce an immense amount of waste that will need to be managed sustainably. But this reflection is not necessarily groundbreaking. When sharing the pictures of face masks washed ashore on the beach,Morris titled his post 'this is our next problem', but this is not new. Our responses to disasters, both man-made and natural, have been a significant source of waste and have been producing evocative images for decades, from mountains of discarded water bottles in post-hurricain Haiti to piles of cardboard packaging waste outside on the margins of a refugee camp in Bangladesh. Moreover, disasters, and the management of disaster waste, have been a well invesitaged topic within waste management studies discourses. However, this body of literature is predominantly concerned with the waste directly caused by disasters (i.e. building rubble, plant material, etc.). Specific focii of investigation have centered on strategies for managing disaster waste (see (Amato et al., 2020; de Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2018; Domingo & Luo, 2017; Dugar et al., 2020; Gabrielli et al., 2018; Karunasena & Amaratunga, 2016; Karunasena et al., 2009 ) including possible options for reuse or recycling (see (Brown & Milke, 2016; Regattieri et al., 2018; Tabata et al., 2019) , the modelling of potential impacts and systems reliability (Cheng et al., 2018; Trivedi et al., 2015) , and the restoration of waste management systems post-disaster (see (Petersen, 2004; Ulusan & Ergun, 2018) . However, what is less understood are the waste impacts of the human or societal responses to these disasters, such as disaster relief, socio-economic restrictions, or shifts in consumption patterns. When waste, stemming from the humanitarian or socio-cultural responses to disasters is discussed, the conversations have not occurred within waste management studies literature, but rather in disaster relief and logistics literature, and then, only tangentially iii . Moreover, despite substantial scholarly attention within waste management studies towards how to sustainably and hygienically manage infectious and other potentially hazardous medical waste, there has been generally little accounting for disaster scenarios, while the literature on emergency medical disaster relief pays, at best, tokenist lip service to waste management issues iv . Although the current Covid-19 pandemic makes this topic feel timely, its urgency is more broadly rooted in climate change. As global temperatures continue to rise, the number of catastrophic climactic events are expected to increase. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between population density and the risk of pandemic, and with current population growth trends, the risk of human-made disasters (both climactic and disease), especially within the Global South, is expected to increase expontentially (Gholipour, 2013) . As such, the waste impact of these disasters is likely to significantly increase, as well as the waste footprint of our reactions to them. In these circumstances, the current silence within waste management discourses on this topic is unacceptable. The purpose of this discussion is to draw attention to this knowledge gap and to highlight the absolutely essential role that solid waste management must play in a humanitarian response, now, towards Covid-19, and to other, future disasters.",

Fears of contamination, social distancing regulations, and stay-at-home orders have contributed to a visible resurgence in consumer preference for single-use products for both hygenic reasons, as well as convenience. Largely, this has been in response to state-issued instructions and guidelines for disaster preparedness, so we must be cautious how we characterise and contextualise individual choice. Nonetheless, as Kaufman (2020) has observed, the Covid-19 pandemic has served as an opportunity for the plastics industry to restore a legitimacy to single-use plastic products that had eroded over the past decade. How can we quantify the waste impact of this consumption and disposal, as well its potential impacts on muninicipal waste management systems? Moreover, how many of these consumption patterns will become ingrained, and how do we push the reset button to continue to move towards sustainability and zero waste? These shifts may have unforseen consequences which resonate long after the pandemic recedes. For example, lockdown conditions in the Global North have corresponded to a dramatic increase in consumers flushing thick, fabric-like wipes down home toilets (Kaur, 2020) . These products cause serious problems for sewer systems that have not been designed for the volume and quantity of this novel material v . Coping with the resulting blockages puts a burden on municipal governments already operating under severe strain. Moreover, the implications for non-sewered sanitation across much of the Global South are even less understood.",
