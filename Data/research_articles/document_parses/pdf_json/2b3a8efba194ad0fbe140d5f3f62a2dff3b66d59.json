On a given day during the summer season (late June to early August) approximately 150 000 visitors are on Gotland (so about 50 000 short-term visitors). Further, we assume that the short-term M-visitors have double the interaction with P -individuals due to more contacts at restaurants, hotels and similar, so k S = 1. In our base model it is assumed that the basic reproduction number, effects of preventive measures and immunity level among the Stockholmer's are R (1\u2212c (M ) ) = 1.1, so the amount of close contacts long-term metropolitans have with provincial people is about 1/3 compared to contacts with other metropolitans (including family).

The level of immunity among M-individuals, r M , and the reproduction number among P -individuals also play a significant role.
