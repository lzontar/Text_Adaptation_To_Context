For parents and children, staying at home is one of these measures. In this situation the handling of young children with special needs such as autism spectrum condition (ASC) could be challenging for families and caregivers. Usually these children have interventions for several hours a week at home with special therapists or in dedicated hospitals and institutes. However at the moment, due to contagion containment measures, both the families and the ASC children are not physically supported by their therapists and they cannot attend the outside interventions. These measures, necessary for the health of all of us, need to be carefully handled to avoid an increase in parental stress and an exacerbation of children's behavioral problems. ASC is a severe multifactorial disorder characterized by an umbrella of specific peculiarities in the areas of the social communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviours [2] . The incidence of ASC is worldwide and recent epidemiological data estimated it to be higher than 1/100 [3, 4] . The main aim of this editorial is to give some advice, summarized in 10 tips, to help families to handle children with ASC during this period.",

For this purpose it is possible to appeal to augmentative alternative communication (AAC).

It would be useful to subdivide the daily activities, assigning a different room for each one of them. This structure can be useful not only for children with ASC who are low and/or middle functioning but also for those who are high functioning. This can be an activity to share with the entire family as a type of game. Using a blackboard, each member of the family can have his space to write the planned activities.",

For this reason, if the children were engaged in psychotherapy before the COVID-19 alert, it is very important that they continue it.
