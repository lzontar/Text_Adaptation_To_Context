However, in our case, the task was to compose a library not restricted to certain target families, but rather a 'general purpose' library serving the academic community through the screening centres of the ChemBioNet (ChemBioNet, http:// www.chembionet.de, is an interdisciplinary consortium of chemists and biologists who exploit small molecules to study biological systems). Such a library should fulfill the following basic requirements: (a) it should be enriched with puta-tive bioactive compounds, (b) it should exhibit a high degree of chemical diversity, (c) it should permit the extraction of structurally related hit clusters, (d) it must be free of artefactcausing reactive or unstable compounds [3] , and (e) it must be physically available. Traditionally, screening collections are based on analysis of a descriptor space spanned by sets of physicochemical and topological descriptors to evaluate the diversity and similarity within the compound collection [4, 5] . The main disadvantage of these descriptor-based strategies is their abstract formulations of molecular structures and properties. Thus, applications of such strategies are often disappointing because a single class of compounds defined by their similarity within a descriptor space can contain different substructures and does not integrate the collected experience of medicinal chemists. The occurrence of defined substructure elements, however, is crucial not only for the biological activities of drugs but even more for their pharmacokinetic or absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties. Recently, fragment-based screening approaches have been applied successfully [6] . However, the binding of small fragments is weak and needs highly sensitive methods such as X-ray crystallography [7] , NMR spectroscopy [8] or the amplification of binding, e.g. by dynamic ligation screening [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 166, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 875, "end": 878, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1141, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1144, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1836, "end": 1839, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1955, "end": 1958, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1981, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2053, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Thus, identification of biologically relevant substructures is an important prerequisite of all the screening libraries.

In order to identify substructures, the maximum common substructure (MCS) algorithm of ClassPharmer version 3.2 was applied (ClassPharmer, Simulations Plus Inc., Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA). The MCS algorithm is based on a genetic approach published by Gasteiger [16] . It performs a graph-based analysis of compounds from a database to classify them topologically and to place them into classes based on large, significant substructures learned on the fly. The principle of the MCS approach is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Using the parameters described in computational methods, 1305 classes of substructures were identified using the 35,000 small molecules of the WDI as input.

One important parameter used in the calculation of the diversity set is the number of the WDI-derived substructures found in the compound. This parameter, used as a numerical descriptor, ensures that the compounds within the subli-braries selected for each of the available substructure classes contain not only the substructure by itself but also the substructure in combination with an increasing number of other identified substructures.

These descriptors capture hydrophobic and hydrophilic effects, polarizability and electrostatic interactions, and therefore represent a meaningful chemical space and pay attention on as many properties of the molecules as possible. Moreover, these descriptors are independent of our substructure approach. In order to reduce the dimensionality and to avoid collinearity, a principal component analysis was performed on the basis of these descriptors. Figure 4a represents the chemical space spanned by the ChemBioNet collection in comparison to the vendor stock collection. It can be observed that the 16,671 compounds occupy almost the same chemical space as the 550,000 compounds of the ChemDiv stock collection, although they constitute only 3% of the compounds. Therefore, our strategy for compiling a screening collection did not lead to a major loss of chemical diversity compared to the vendor stock collection. Furthermore, the chemical space of our screening collection was compared to the chemical space of the annotated drug molecules from the WDI [20] and an available chemical database of 237,046 compounds (ChemACX) [25] . The ChemACX library was chosen as an example of a typical database with commercially available chemical compounds. Although, of course, it also contains bioactive molecules, this is not the emphasis of this database. The result can be seen in Fig. 4b . Comparison of the ChemBioNet compounds with those of the WDI shows that both libraries occupy a similar region of the chemical space represented by the first ten principal components. Furthermore, it can be seen that this region of the chemical space is only a small portion of the chemical space spanned by the ChemACX compounds. Though normalized, the chemical space of the 237,046 compounds of the ChemACX spans a much larger space than that of the ChemDiv stock compounds, despite the fact that these are only roughly half the number of compounds contained in the ChemDiv stock collection. Assuming that the selected drug molecules from the WDI represent the biologically relevant chemical space, the Fig. 4 Representation of the chemical space of our screening collection in comparison to the ChemDiv stock collection, the WDI and the ChemACX 32 P_VSA descriptors were calculated, and then principal component analysis was performed [24] .

For example, adamantane, one of our WDI-derived substructures, may be interpreted as a combination of several cyclohexane rings or a combination of the decaline ring with another cyclohexane ring. Of course, one might argue that there is a certain risk in only identifying substructures from the WDI which contains no new chemical entities and therefore no novel ones can be found using our strategy. It should be noted, however, that novel drugs are usually combinations of known bioactive substructures. Moreover, the mentioned risk was further minimized by using the content of substructures as a numerical descriptor for the diversity set of 100 compounds per substructure. As a result, it is possible that combinations of substructures are provided in the final library, which have not been found before in bioactive databases. Using this approach, we selected the compounds with our WDI-derived substructure alone (though with differing side chains) and also in combination with other substructures, where both the number and the combinations with the other substructures varied heavily.
