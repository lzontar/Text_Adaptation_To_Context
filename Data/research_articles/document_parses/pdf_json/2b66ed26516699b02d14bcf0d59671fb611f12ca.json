At the beginning of the VOA, the focus of the algorithm is on the identification of new viruses in the decision space. During the replications and with increasing the Int value, the changes in the produced virus decreases, and the neighbors of the SVs, as the best viruses in the host cell, are exploited. The number of generated viruses from CVs and SVs are determined using two control parameters called common viruses' growth rate (CVGR) and strong viruses' growth rate (SVGR), respectively.

In the VOA, the number of existing viruses is dynamic and can vary from one replication to another one. The third phase of the VOA is the maintenance procedure in which several viruses (n kv ) are killed to survive the host cell. The number of killed viruses in each replication is defined as a random integer between one and the number of viruses in the cell minus the number of strong viruses. To select the candidate viruses to be killed, more chance is given to the worst viruses, which are the weakest ones. Based on the scientific experiments, the average capacity of a host cell is about 1000 viruses. It means that if the number of viruses in a host exceeds this threshold, more viruses should be killed to keep the capacity of the cell.

Prior to computing the membership degrees, the membership functions of the input variables and the regression coefficients of the consequence parts of all fuzzy rules, as well as the number of the fuzzy rules,should be determined. The number of fuzzy rules in the ANFIS is set using subtractive clustering (SC) algorithm, as one of the fastest unsupervised training algorithms[33]. Moreover, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is served to determine the initial center and spread of Gaussian fuzzy membership functions of the input variables[34]. Additionally, the regression coefficients of the consequence parts of all fuzzy rules are the same and equal the regression coefficients achieved from the linear regression model fitted the existing data. After generating the initial fuzzy rule base, the training phase of the ANFIS begins in which the membership functions and regression coefficients are optimized in such a way that the error of the system minimized. The hybrid optimization algorithm is the most popular training algorithm of the ANFIS in which the least-squares method (LSM) is used to optimize the regression coefficients of fuzzy rules in the forward movement of information from the first layer to the fifth layer[35].Meanwhile, the gradient descend (GD) algorithm is used to optimize the parameters related to the membership functions in the backward movement.Second layer: After calculating the membership degrees of all membership functions for given input variables, the aggregated value of the antecedent part of each fuzzy rule is calculated, using the following equation, which shows the firing strength of the rule.Fourth layer: Having the regression coefficients of all rules, the consequence value of each rule is calculated for given input variables, as follows: \u2211 (6) Fifth layer: The output of the ANFIS model for given input variables is calculated as the weighted consequence values of all rules, formulated as follows: \u2211 (7) 3.3. Incorporated model of ANFIS and VOA Trapping in the local optima is the critical drawback of the GD algorithm. The accuracy of this algorithm depends totally on the initial values of decision variables in the optimization problem. Therefore, serving VOA can be a good idea to optimize the centers and spreads of membership functions of input variables as well as the regression coefficients of the consequence parts of fuzzy rules in such a way to avoid the local optima through the exploration of searching space at the beginning of replications and also to converge to the optimal solution through the exploitation of the best existing solutions. In this regard, each virus in the VOA is represented as a matrix with the dimension of NR\u00d7 (3\u00d7n+1) in which n is the number of input variables, and NR is the number of rules in the rule base. A schematic representation of a virus in the proposed model is revealed in Fig. 6. The flowchart of the proposed model is shown in Fig. 7, and its different stages are explained in the followings: Fig. 6. A schemat ic representation of a virus in t he proposed model. Stage 1: Prior to running the proposed algorithm, its control parameters, including the maximum number of virus replication (MNVR), the number of initial viruses (NIV), the number of SVs (NSV) in the host cell, the CVGR and the SVGR are set. Stage 2: The initial fuzzy rule base is created using the SC and FCM algorithms; where its parameters are coded as the first virus in the host cell, and other viruses are randomly created. Stage 3: Each virus represents an ANFIS model with the defined parameters. Using the first to the fifth steps in the ANFIS, the predicted values are computed for given input variables, compared to the real values, and the error of a virus can be calculated. Stage 4: All viruses are sorted from the best to the worst ones, and the first SVN viruses are chosen as the SVs, while the rest are selected as the CVs. Stage 5: Based on the CVGR and SVGR, the new viruses are, respectively, created using Eqs. (1)and(2)for the CVs and SVs, decoded into an ANFIS model, and evaluated.Stage 6:The newly generated viruses are mixed with the previous ones to make an archive, and its average error is assessed. If there is no improvement, the Int parameter is updated. Then, the maintenance strategy of the host cell is pursued to kill some vulnerable CVs for the surviving principle of the host cell. If the virus population is more than 1000, the additional weak viruses should be removed. The replication process of viruses is continued number of virus replication is satisfied. After finishing the algorithm, the best virus is saved as the final ANFIS model, called the ANFIS-VOA-I model in this study.Stage 7:In the ANFIS-VOA model-II, the parameters achieved from the best virus of the previous stage are used to train using LSM and GD algorithms.

Additionally, the slight decline in the infection rate isobserved by increasing the wind speed.
