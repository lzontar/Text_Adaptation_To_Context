Here, we quantify the biases caused by the use of inaccurate data in the estimation of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number R(t). By focusing on Italy and Spain, two of the hardest-hit countries in Europe and worldwide, we show that if the symptoms' onset time-series is inferred from the notification date series, the R(t) curve cannot capture nor describe accurately the early dynamics of the epidemic. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the containment measures that were implemented, such as national lockdowns, can be properly evaluated only when R(t) is estimated using the real time-series of dates of symptoms' onset. Our findings show that extreme care should be taken when a pivotal quantity like R(t) is used to make decisions and to evaluate different alternatives.",

R(t) represents the mean number of secondary infections generated by one primary infected individual, over the course of an epidemic. In contrast to the basic reproductive number, R 0 [2] , which assumes the population to be fully susceptible, the temporal variations of R(t) reflect the changes in transmissibility caused by the depletion of susceptibles during the epidemic, and by the presence of control interventions and spontaneous behavioral responses. When R(t) decreases below the threshold value of 1, the number of new infections begins to decline. This quantity is thus pivotal to evaluate the impact of interventions, calibrate epidemiological models, and guide the lift of restrictions, where in place.",

Several estimation methods account for such lack of information by using time-independent delay distributions from symptom onset to reporting [5, 6] . However, the impact of using case-notification data -instead of the true symptom onset -as the main data input for estimating R(t) has not been investigated so far.",

We focus on two European countries that are among the most severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, Italy and Spain.

Secondly, we use the time-series of reported cases by notification date, as provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The third time-series of symptoms' onset is inferred (Inferred Symptoms A) by applying a convolution to the time-series of notification dates with the probability distribution P(\u2206t) of the elapsed time between the dates of symptom onset and laboratory confirmation, measured from a large line list dataset [7] . Lastly, another time-series of symptoms' onset could be inferred (Inferred Symptoms B) by backwards shifting the dates of laboratory-confirmed deaths by 11 days, which corresponds to the median time elapsed between symptom onset and death in Spain and Italy . The resulting time-series of real symptoms' onset, notification 1 2 date and inferred symptoms' onset A and B are shown in Fig. 1 . One can see how the time-series of the time-shifted deaths, while obtained with a rough approximation, is remarkably similar to the time-series of the symptom onset dates inferred through the delay distribution P(\u2206t). However, both curves fail to match the true epidemic curve by symptom onset, which peaks earlier and declines faster than the two inferred curves. Note also that there is a significant delay between the time-series of the real symptom onset and the notification date, as reported by the ECDC, and that such delay is not constant in time. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Note that since surveillance data consolidates as time goes by, our R(t) estimations do not take into account the last month of data. Figure 2 shows a comparison of the values obtained for R(t) for each of the time series considered. The comparison reveals remarkable differences between the different R(t) curves. Several observations, which hold for both countries, are in order. First, neither the incidence curve by notification date, nor the ones by inferred symptoms' onset allow for a correct assessment of the early behavior of the epidemic. The curve obtained using the symptom onset inferred by convolution underestimates the true R(t) value, while those corresponding to notification dates and time-shifted dates of death greatly overestimate it (R(t) could be up to 6). Second, both of the inferred symptoms' onset time-series yield R(t) curves which, past the dates of implementation of the containment measures, decline slower than the one obtained for the real symptoms' onset. Third, only when using the time-series of real symptoms' onset, R(t) falls below 1 within 5-6 days after national lockdowns in both countries, which is compatible with the incubation period of the disease [9] . On the contrary, by using notification dates, R(t) does not fall below 1 until early April. These dates are explicitly shown in Table 1 . Figure 2 . Estimated R(t) curves for Spain (left) and Italy (right) for each of the four time-series considered. We use EpiEstim with 7 days sliding windows and a gamma distributed serial interval with shape 1.87 and rate 0.28 [10] . 95% credible intervals are plotted as pink areas. The dashed vertical lines represent the dates in which main containment measures were applied in each country. For Spain, the \"second lockdown\" represents the all non-essential activity closure that was implemented on top of the lockdown imposed earlier.",
