For illustration, we make use of the Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) mortality data and vaccination data of the very young (age 0-2) and the very old (age >64) during 2004-2005 Taiwan winter influenza season to fit our model and to compute the relevant reproduction numbers. The reproduction number for this winter flu season is estimated to be slightly above one (~1.0001). Conclusions: Comparatively large errors in fitting the P&I mortality data of the elderly (>64) were observed shortly after winter school closings in January, which may indicate the impact of younger, more active age groups transmitting influenza to other age groups outside of the school settings; in particular, to the elderly in the households. Pre-symptomatic infections seemed to have little effect on the model fit, while asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives has a more pronounced impact on the model fit for the elderly mortality, perhaps indicating a larger role in disease transmission by asymptomatic infection. Simulations indicate that the impact of vaccination on the disease incidence might not be fully revealed in the change (or the lack thereof) in the effective reproduction number with interventions, but could still be substantial. The estimated per contact transmission probability for susceptible elderly is significantly higher than that of any other age group, perhaps highlighting the vulnerability of the elderly due to close contacts with their caretakers from other age groups. The relative impact of targeting the very young and the very old for vaccination was weakened by their relative inactivity, thus giving evidence of the lack of impact of vaccinating these two groups on the overall transmissibility of the disease in the community.

Moreover, vaccines against a novel pandemic strain might take up to six months to manufacture and deliver, even in developed countries [5] . Given the potential threat of drug-resistance resulting from widespread use of antiviral treatment against pandemic flu, vaccine appears to be our primary weapon to prevent and to mitigate a pandemic.

However, when vaccinating those at greatest risk of mortality becomes impractical (if, e.g., medical care is relatively inaccessible) or inefficient (if, e.g., immune response is deficient), targeting those most likely to expose them to infection might be more preferable [10] . In this way, the very young and the old might be better protected by vaccinating those who are most likely to be in contact with them (thereby reducing their risk of exposure), rather than by being vaccinated. Comparison of influenza mortality among elderly Japanese during time periods when schoolchildren were and were not vaccinated suggests that the infected children pose a risk to others [11] , including the elderly.

Using a range of mortality rates reported previously for past influenza epidemics and pandemics, they concluded that the optimal strategy depends critically on the viral transmission level (or reproduction number) of the virus.

We note that day 105 was January 22, 2005 , when all schools in Taiwan closed for the winter vacation which lasted until after the traditional lunar New Year holiday, in mid-February of that year. The school closure, and subsequent shutdown of all non-essential venues during the week-long New Year holiday, surely had a significant impact on the contact rates which was not reflected in our constant contact matrix that implicitly assumes that inter-age group contact patterns remain the same during the whole season. More precisely, the P&I deaths for the elderly exhibits a slight increase for about 3 weeks after the closing of schools (shortly after the New Year) when compared to the model predicted values, while the P&I deaths for the adults of age 22-64 dropped substantially below the theoretical curve. These results indicate that the school closure and the subsequent New Year holiday led to more frequent contacts by the elderly in the households with family members who spent more time at home during the holidays At the same time, there were less contacts for the adults at the workplace (especially for those working in the educational facilities who had longer holidays) during this time period. Since most individuals in the elder group (and the very young) are not directly affected by the school closings and the holidays, one may speculate that the difference in the actual mortality and the theoretical mortality of the elderly, as averaged over the whole time period, is due at least in parts to the impact of interaction between the elderly and younger children with the school-age children and adults, when the activity levels (in terms of frequency as well as whom to make contact with) of the latter groups were significantly changed by the holidays.

Therefore, the relative impact of targeting these two groups for vaccination was weakened by their relative inactivity, thus giving further evidence of the lack of impact of vaccinating the very young and the very old on the overall transmissibility of the disease in the community. However, simulation with the same parameter values as in Fig. 3 except assuming no vaccination in the young children and elderly age groups, i.e., \u03c5 1 (t) = \u03c5 7 (t) = 0, and everything else the same produces Fig. 5 , where the result indicates that the impact of no vaccination (red curves) would still be significant, resulting in nearly 4-fold increase in mortality of elderly and 2-fold increase in mortality of adults. Therefore, the impact of vaccination on the disease incidence sometimes might not be fully revealed in the change (or the lack thereof) in the effective reproduction number with intervention but could still be substantial, since it is a simple mathematical property that distinctly different (next generation) matrices may have similar eigenvalues.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 638, "end": 646, "text": "Table A2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1183, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1334, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Vaccination"}, {"text": "Furthermore, in our simulations we had assumed vaccine efficacy (proportion of infection prevented) of 40% for elderly and 70% for young children, to be in line with current literature [8, 9] .

This further highlights the high vulnerability of the elderly (or the younger children) to exposure from other age groups, and demonstrates the need for morbidity-based strategy to prevent the elderly (or younger children) influenza Figure 5 Simulation with the same model parameters as in Fig. 3 , except \u03c5 1 (t) = \u03c5 7 (t) = 0.

The higher transmission probabilities of young children and elderly infectives could reflect, again, the fact that contacts with these individuals are usually of a more intimate nature, although these probabilities are not as drastically different as their vulnerability to be infected.

In other words, vaccination is not always beneficial in reducing incidence and the design of an effective vaccination program in multigroup model is highly nontrivial, unlike in simple epidemic models where there is a simple formula for the critical vaccination coverage level necessary for eradication (p c ) [20] . In fact, it has been shown mathematically by Hadeler and Castillo-Chavez [32] , using a model with a core group, that partially effective vaccination program may actually increase the total number of cases. Explicit quantification of an optimal vaccination policy ( [33] ) in a multi-group population scenario remains to be a challenge for mathematical modelers and is beyond the scope of this work. Moreover, the model fit was carried out with vaccination (of the elderly and small children of age 2 or less) as the only intervention since vaccination was the only intervention that was implemented during the flu seasonal for which the fitted P&I data was collected.

One would expect that pre-epidemic immunity does impact the outbreak, but nonetheless it is not reflected, at least not in the reproduction numbers. Pre-symptomatic infection and asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives were incorporated into the proposed model. To gauge the roles these two features of influenza might play in a seasonal influenza epidemic, we performed the following simulations. Again using Fig. 3 as a benchmark, we first assume no pre-symptomatic infection (\u03c4 = 0) with all other parameter values unchanged (Fig. 6 ). Next we assume no asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives (a i = a i V = 0) (Fig. 7) .
