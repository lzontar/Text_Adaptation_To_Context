The R 0 of an infection determines its potential to start an outbreak, the severity of control measures needed to contain the spread, and the fraction of the population that will be infected in the absence of interventions. 5 However, once an outbreak is underway, the timevarying effective reproduction number 'R t ' is more relevant as it tracks the subsequent changes in transmission, and can thus be used to monitor the efficacy of control measures and adjust them accordingly. [6] [7] [8] However, any given transmission event is reflected in the data only after a delay, which must be accounted for in the estimation of such indicators for accurate interpretation. 7 Previous studies have shown that a severe epidemic with R 0~2 \u20224 can be contained by combining effective quarantine, behavioral change to reduce social mixing, targeted antiviral prophylaxis, and prevaccination. 5 However, in the absence of targeted therapeutics and vaccination for COVID19, an unprecedented onethird of the world's population is currently under lockdowns -with the primary target of reducing the R t below the threshold of 1. 6, 9 India responded to the COVID19 pandemic rapidly and decisively by imposing a nationwide lockdown on 25", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 145, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 288, "end": 289, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 407, "end": 408, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 885, "end": 886, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1143, "end": 1146, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1150, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1154, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1333, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1547, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1780, "text": "6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1781, "end": 1782, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "March 2020, when there were 536 cases and 10 deaths. 3, 10 This 'suppression strategy', though effective, has its limitations the social and economic cost of such populationwide social distancing is huge, which limits the long term implementation of these measures. 9, 11 Additionally, containing COVID19 in India is a unique challenge due to its high population density, underprepared healthcare system, and wide socioeconomic disparity. 12 A large proportion of India's labour force works as dailywage laborers or migrant workers, and are especially affected during such times, making lockdowns untenable without parallel social support. 13 There could be yet unseen adverse effects in the form of nonCOVID19 morbidity and mortality due to aggravation of malnutrition, chronic diseases and lack of access to healthcare during this time. 14 At the same time, premature withdrawal of lockdowns without adequately planned interventions for the postlockdown phase may lead to reemergence later, or the second wave. 6, 9 Thus there arises a need to create a balance to ensure that the disease is contained and the healthcare system remains well prepared while minimizing the collateral damage from intensive blanket interventions.

Kerala's ability to maintain a low Rt may be attributed to its high literacy rate, active community participation and decentralisation of power-village councils taking the initiative to contain cases locally, use of drones for cluster containment, and social welfare initiatives which provided isolation rooms for people with cramped homes which didn't allow social distancing from family.
