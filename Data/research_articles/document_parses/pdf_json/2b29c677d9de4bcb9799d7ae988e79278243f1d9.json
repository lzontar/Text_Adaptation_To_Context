However, due to the loss of contrast at high frequencies, they generally need to be post-processed before modeling in order to improve their interpretability. To that end, approaches based on B-factor correction are the most popular choices, yet they suffer from some limitations such as the fact that the correction is applied globally, ignoring the presence of heterogeneity in the map local quality that cryo-EM reconstructions tend to exhibit. With the aim of overcoming these limitations, here we present DeepEMhancer, a deep learning approach designed to perform automatic post-processing of cryo-EM maps. Trained on a dataset of pairs of experimental cryo-EM maps and maps sharpened by LocScape using their respective atomic models, DeepEMhancer has automatically learned how to post-process experimental maps performing masking-like and sharpening-like operations in a single step. DeepEMhancer has been evaluated on a testing set of 20 different experimental maps, showing its ability to obtain much cleaner and detailed versions of the experimental maps, thus, improving their interpretability. Additionally, we have illustrated the benefits of DeepEMhancer with a use case in which the structure of the SARS-CoV 2 RNA polymerase is improved.",

Beginning from thousands of single particle projection images, cryo-EM workflows are capable of obtaining three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of many macromolecules at \"nearatomic\" resolution levels.

Fortunately, loss of contrast can be alleviated using different contrast restoration algorithms, which are usually known as sharpening methods. The first sharpening approach for cryo-EM maps was introduced by Rosenthal and Henderson (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003) and its formulation, based on the B-factor correction, is still at the basis of the most commonly employed sharpening methods, including RELION postprocessing (Kimanius et al., 2016; Zivanov et al., 2018) or Phenix AutoSharpen (Terwilliger et al., 2018) . The principle behind these algorithms consists in the correction of the raw maps by boosting the amplitude of their high frequency Fourier components. The strength of the amplitude boost at each frequency depends on the frequency itself and on a single number, the B-factor, that measures the global loss of contrast. Thus, although the different B-factor-based methods differ in the procedures employed to determine the B-factor that is applied, all of them modify the volume globally in a similar manner.",

Consequently, for the case of maps that exhibit heterogeneous local resolution, some regions could be undersharpened whereas others could be oversharpened. Recently, local sharpening algorithms, that alleviate this shortcoming, have been proposed. Thus, the LocScale (Jakobi et al., 2017) algorithm uses the information contained in an atomic model to locally scale up a map. Such transformation is achieved by means of a sliding window approach in which the amplitudes of the map region that lay inside the window are scaled up to agree with the atomic model provided. Following a totally different strategy, the LocalDeblur (Ram\u00edrez-Aportela et al., 2020) algorithm employs a Wiener filtering approach that performs local deblurring with a strength proportional to an estimation of the local resolution, that has to be pre-computed. Similarly, LocSpiral (Kaur et al., 2020) employs the spiral phase transformation to factorize the volume and then, perform a local enhancement based on the normalization and thresholding of the amplitudes.",

Deep learning has revolutionized the field of Artificial Intelligence and its impact has been felt in many others including cryo-EM. Deep learning in cryo-EM was firstly applied for the problem of particle picking (Wagner et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017) and since then, it has evolved to deal with other questions such as map reconstruction (Gupta et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2019) , map segmentation (Maddhuri Venkata Subramaniya et al., 2019; Si et al., 2020) or local resolution determination (Avramov et al., 2019; Ram\u00edrez-Aportela et al., 2019) . As in most of those methods, our approach relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained on massive quantities of data. Particularly, our development, that follows a simple image super-resolution setup (Yang et al., 2019) , exploits the vast amount of structural information that is contained in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) database (Lawson et al., 2015) in order to mimic the local sharpening effect of the LocScale algorithm. However, DeepEMhancer does not require any atomic model to function and, contrary to previous methods, it also performs automatic (tight) masking of input maps. Our results show that DeepEMhancer, that works in a fully automatic manner, is able to largely improve the interpretability of the maps contained in our benchmark, performing better than classical Bfactor approaches.",

The first one is empirical: we obtained better results when targets were produced with LocScale, probably because the input and target maps, although different, they still share some similar properties such as intensity ranges or local quality, which are not necessarily preserved when using simulated maps as targets. The other reason is that we wanted to reproduce the state-of-the-art local sharpening effect and not a new type of postprocessing that could not be compatible with downstream atomic modelling tools.",

On the contrary, we have relaxed our quite strict redundancy control policy in the training set allowing up to five cluster representatives in an attempt to increase the size of this set.

Thus, for DeepEMhancer maps, we measured a median correlation coefficient of 0.91 in contrast to 0.60 for input maps (see Supplementary Material Figure S1 ). Such an important increase in the correlation coefficient implies that DeepEMhancer has learned to accurately reproduce the effect of LocScale sharpening with one important advantage: no atomic models are required to employ DeepEMhancer. Although reproducing the LocScale sharpening effect was our main objective, the ultimate goal of map post-processing is to simplify the process of atomic model building. With the aim of studying if DeepEMhancer also contributes to that purpose, we next explored whether DeepEMhancer postprocessed maps were more similar to the actual atomic models. To do so, we computed, for all the maps included in the testing set, the Fourier Shell Correlation coefficient (FSC) between the input and post-processed maps against the reference maps obtained from the atomic models. As it is shown in Figure 1 , for all the examples included in the testing set, the application of DeepEMhancer increased the similarity of the input maps with respect to the references (blue and green bars). Indeed, the post-processed maps exhibit a median FSC resolution value of 3.3 \u00c5 compared to 3.9 \u00c5 for the input maps. Particularly, the median improvement achieved by DeepEMhancer was ~0.6 \u00c5 (~14% in the frequency domain). Such an important improvement confirms that the maps computed by DeepEMhancer are much more similar to the target maps. DeepEMhancer post-processing operation performs a non-linear transformation of the experimental volume that produces a set of effects that could be broadly classified as masking/denoising and sharpening-like features enhancement. In order to disentangle the contribution of the different effects, we have also computed the FSC of the input and post-processed maps using a very tight mask derived from the atomic model. As it can be observed in Figure 1 , the FSC resolution obtained for the post-processed maps tend to be better than the values computed for the input independently of the mask application (green and red bars vs orange bar), which implies that the masking effect is of highquality, as the resolutions for the unmasked DeepEMhancer results tend to be better than the ones for the masked input maps.",

EMD-7099 presents 17 transmembrane helices and, although the overall quality of the map is excellent, visualizing the transmembrane regions is challenging because of the signal that comes from the lipids. As a result, important parts of the protein are not traced. Due to the fact that DeepEMhancer was trained to ignore the signal coming from lipidic layers, this example illustrates the unique characteristics of DeepEMhancer when applied to membrane proteins. Thus, as can be observed in Figure 4a -d, DeepEMhancer has been able to suppress the signal coming from the lipid layer in a much more simple and effective way than diminishing the threshold in the raw map or the B-factor-based sharpened maps. The noise suppression effect simplifies the process of model building, as the researchers do not have to deal with masks or larger thresholds that make the visualization of near to noise level features more difficult. Yet, not only DeepEMhancer produces a noise reduction effect, but also it is able to enhance some parts of the map that under B-factor based sharpening seem noisy and disconnected. Such improvement, although observed in several regions of the map, Figure 6 .

As in the previous example, the overall quality of the map is quite good, yet it presents lower quality regions. Figure  5a shows an overview of the published map, displayed at the recommended threshold, and the map obtained with DeepEMhancer. Although it is true that both the original map and the postprocessed map look very similar, it is also true that there exist important differences. Firstly, the map processed with DeepEMhancer is cleaner than the original one. Serve as an example the removal of the artifacts that the published map presents near the elbow of the complex (see Figure 5a , red box). More importantly, there can also be found many regions for which the DeepEMhancer postprocessed volume resolves better the different residues of the regions. One of such examples can be found near the N-terminal end of the protein complex. Thus, as it is shown in Figure 5b , the densities that correspond to the strands of the beta sheet are better separated than in the published volume. It is important to notice that this better separation is not a consequence of the employed thresholds, as it is proven by the fact that rising the threshold makes the densities corresponding to the backbone discontinuous before the densities for the two strands separate (see Figure 5b) . As a result, we can affirm that the quality of this region has been improved by the usage of DeepEMhancer.",

(Gao et al., 2020) , corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The original map presents detailed structure up to 2.9 \u00c5 resolution, however as is often the case in cryo-EM, the resolution of the map is highly heterogeneous. We have chosen this map not only for the importance of this structure in current days but also because of the fact that the heterogeneous quality of the map density presents an ideal case for DeepEMhancer software. As it is shown in Figure 6a , the application of the algorithm reduces the noise and improves the consistency and depiction of the map. To better illustrate these differences, we have chosen two different regions in chains A and D where the differences between the original and the DeepEMHancer map can be appreciated ( Figure. 6b-c). While the density in the original map looks noisy or discontinuous depending on the displayed threshold (Figure 6 b-c, left and middle panel), the application of the DeepEMhancer software results in a well-defined continuous density where the side chains are nicely depicted (Figure 6 b-c, right panel). This improvement in the map density allowed us to close the loop between residues C114 to I132 from chain D tracing 4 new residues that were not traced in the original structure ( Figure 6b and Figure 7a ). The improvement of the density is not only applicable to the edges of the map but it can be also appreciated in its core. Residues H362 to L366 in chain A, traced on the original map where positioned more accurately on the density after map post-processing ( Figure 6c and Figure 7b ).
