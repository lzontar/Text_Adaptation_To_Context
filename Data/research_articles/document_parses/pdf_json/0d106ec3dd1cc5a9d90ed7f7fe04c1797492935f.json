To provide a system for understanding and prototyping designs we have developed a mathematical model of two patients supported by a mechanical ventilator. We propose a standard setup where we simulate the introduction of T-splitters to supply air to two patients and a modified setup where we introduce a variable resistance in each inhalation pathway and one-way valves in each exhalation pathway. Using the standard setup, we demonstrate that ventilating two patients with mismatched lung compliances from a single ventilator will lead to clinically-significant reductions in tidal volume in the patient with the lowest respiratory compliance. Using the modified setup, we demonstrate that it could be possible to achieve the same tidal volumes in two patients with mismatched lung compliances, and we show that the tidal volume of one patient can be manipulated independently of the other.

The disease originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and was first documented through a series of unexplained pneumonia cases in December 2019. 1 The disease has subsequently spread rapidly worldwide and by the end of February 2020 several countries, including in Europe, were experiencing sustained transmission. According to the WHO as of 2 nd April 2020 there were 900,306 confirmed cases worldwide in 206 countries, areas or territories and 45,693 confirmed deaths. 2 The virus continues to spread globally with a reproductive number estimated at 2.5.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 284, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 609, "end": 610, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Covid-19 causes a multitude of symptoms with the main symptoms seen being fever and dry cough.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Although some cases are asymptomatic, severe disease can cause death at an estimated rate of around 3-4%. 2 Although myocardial damage and circulatory failure contribute to Covid-19 deaths, the main cause of death is respiratory failure 3 and the majority of serious cases require intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation. It is estimated that the ICU capacity of all EU/EEA countries (including the UK) would be exceeded at a prevalence of 100 hospitalised Covid-19 patients per 100,000 of the population (based on the Hubei providence scenario at the peak of the epidemic). 4 According to the most recent European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control report the majority of EU/EEA countries were predicted to reach this scenario by the end of March 2020. 4 Major difficulties in predicting the course of the outbreak given the exponential spread during the early phase, mitigated by behavioural changes and government methods, mean there is large uncertainty in the models, but widespread agreement that ventilator availability is likely to be a critical factor in patient care. As such, there is worldwide concern that there will be a shortfall of mechanical ventilators at the height of this global pandemic. As one example, estimates of the number of ventilators in the USA range from 60,000 to 160,000, whilst up to 1 million ventilators may be required at the height of the USA pandemic. 5 Regardless of the strategy used for estimating this latter number, the national strategic reserve is not thought to be sufficient to fill the projected gap. 6 Given the predictions for a huge global shortfall in ventilators, strategies have been proposed for ventilator sharing. In 2006, Neyman et al found that a single ventilator could be modified quickly in an emergency department setting to ventilate 4 simulated adult patients for a short period of time. 7 Subsequently Paladino et al successfully ventilated 4 adult-human-sized sheep on a single ventilator for at least 12 hours. 8 During the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic this approach has received significant media attention, 9 with at least two clinical protocols in development, 10 and it is reported that national decision makers are either considering 11 or have recommended this approach. 12 Importantly, such ventilation strategies assume equal lung physiology in all patients and are likely only to be successful in situations where multiple patients with similar lung physiology require ventilation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 106, "end": 107, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 598, "end": 599, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 784, "end": 785, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1423, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1582, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1885, "end": 1886, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2011, "end": 2012, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2173, "end": 2175, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2286, "end": 2288, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "During Covid-19 the clinical picture can range from a mild illness to pneumonia, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock. 13 ARDS is an acute diffuse, inflammatory lung injury, leading to increased pulmonary vascular permeability, increased lung weight and loss of aerated lung tissue. 14 It is a heterogeneous disease that lowers lung compliance as a function of disease severity and it is highly unlikely that any two Covid-19 patients will have either the same lung physiology or the same ventilator requirements.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 170, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "As such, the practice of ventilator sharing has been widely debated.

We designed four experiments to answer the research questions for this work: i. Model validation. Using the Standard Splitter, we connect patients that have lungs with identical parameters, i.e. Lung Models A-A, B-B, C-C and D-D, and ventilate using pressure control ventilation. ii. Evaluating the Standard Splitter when ventilating two patients with mismatched lung compliance. Using the standard setup, we connected patients with different levels of respiratory compliance, i.e. Lung Models A-B, A-C and A-D, to quantify the effect of delivering the same ventilator settings to two patient with mismatched lung compliance. iii. Achieving equivalent tidal volumes in patients with mismatched lung compliance. Using the Modified Splitter, we connected patients with different levels of respiratory compliance, i.e. Lung Models A-B, A-C and A-D, to demonstrate whether, by adjusting the values of RV1, RV2, and PIP, we are able to deliver equal tidal volumes to two patients with mismatched respiratory compliance. iv.
