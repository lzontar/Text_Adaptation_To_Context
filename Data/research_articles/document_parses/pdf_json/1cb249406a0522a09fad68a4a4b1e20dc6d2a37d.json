[3] [4] [5] [6] The mortality gap among individuals with SMI has been the subject of extensive epidemiologic study. Although increased mortality among individuals with SMI is multifactorial, serious medical illnesses, most notably cardiovascular disease and cancer, contribute significantly to increased mortality. People with SMI experience standardized mortality ratios of 3.6 for cardiovascular disease, 2.4 for cancer, and 9.9 for COPD. 6 These disparities persist even when controlling for confounders like socioeconomic status and comorbidities. 7 The high burden of serious medical illness among individuals with SMI suggests a need for tailored palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care. Palliative care, a specialty of medicine dedicated to the holistic care of individuals with serious medical illnesses, has become part of the standard of serious illness care. 8 The roles of palliative care include psycho-social-spiritual care, symptom management, and medical communication. However, most palliative care clinicians are not psychiatrists, and may not have training in managing comorbid SMI. We submit that consultation-liaison (CL) psychiatrists are well positioned at the interface of specialist medical services (oncology, cardiology), palliative medicine, and psychiatry, to fill this gap and improve the quality of EOL care for individuals with SMI. 9, 10 In particular, the role of CL psychiatrists in improving end-of-life care for individuals with SMI is more important now than ever. The COVID-19 pandemic has put unprecedented strains on palliative care delivery systems require new models and tools, many of which may not be inclusive of or tailored towards individuals with SMI. 11, 12 This paper reviews current data on EOL care for individuals with SMI, with the goal of providing CL psychiatrists necessary information to provide high quality care to individuals with comorbid SMI and life-limiting medical illness. Following a review of existing epidemiologic data on EOL care for individuals with SMI, we identify barriers to the provision of quality EOL care for such individuals and identify best practices in the role of the CL psychiatrist to overcome such barriers.

Chochinov et al. used 12 years of provincial health data from Manitoba, Canada, comparing utilization of various health services among individuals with schizophrenia with matched controls. 13 Individuals with schizophrenia were less than half as likely to receive specialty palliative care. Individuals with schizophrenia were about 30% less likely to be prescribed analgesia, possibly reflecting undertreatment or under-reporting of pain; this discrepancy was even more pronounced among individuals with cancer. While terminally ill, individuals with schizophrenia also had significantly less access to their psychiatrists and were more likely to spend their last months in a nursing home. Population-level data from other health systems including Australia and New Zealand support Chochinov's finding that individuals with SMI are 2-4 times less likely than individuals without SMI to access palliative care services in the last months of life. 14, 15 Data from studies in Taiwan and France are somewhat more ambiguous: depending on the metrics employed and the subgroups studied, palliative care utilization by medically ill patients with SMI could be seen to be either increased or decreased, or both. 16, 17 Data from the United States is limited. A retrospective study of decedents from the University of Washington Health System showed that mental illness was associated with higher nursing home use and more ED visits at the end of life. 18 However, this data was not specific to patients with SMI. Kelly Irwin and colleagues completed a retrospective study of 95 patients with breast cancer and schizophrenia in one healthcare system between 1995 and 2015. 19 Only 38% of patients who died had a palliative care consultation, with all but one being inpatient, and only 44% had documented referral to hospice. In contrast, a small study in the Veteran Affairs system showed veterans with schizophrenia were significantly less likely to initiate chemotherapy but had comparable advance directives, opiate prescription, DNR/DNI orders, and hospice enrollment. 20 To sum up so far, individuals with SMI have a heavy burden of serious medical illness, and experience disparities in availability and kinds of EOL care. Such disparities include differences in access to palliative care and specialty medical care, differences in provision of both disease modifying and life-extending treats in the EOL period, and differences in nursing home utilization and place of care. Such discrepancies may both lend themselves to and reflect suboptimal EOL care for individuals with SMI. Furthermore, there is almost no existing data on the clinical practice of EOL care for individuals with SMI; existing data focuses on systems-level utilization and access and less so on clinical discrepancies in palliative care services like analgesia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 350, "end": 352, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1111, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1114, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1367, "end": 1370, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1373, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1607, "end": 1609, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1829, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2227, "end": 2229, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Understanding the barriers to improving EOL care for individuals with SMI has been conceptualized as a tripart model which includes patient, health-care, and societal factors. 21 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 178, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Barriers to Care and Contributors to Disparity"}, {"text": "Multiple aspects of SMI make the provision of EOL care challenging.

For example, in the psychiatric setting, staff may worry about giving a patient too many pain medications and hastening the dying process or fear the legal ramifications of not performing resuscitation on a dying patient. 34 Psychiatrists may be uncomfortable with diagnosis and management of medical conditions and may have limited capacity to provide palliative care. 10 Conversely, when patients with SMI enter a predominantly medical treatment setting, they may be cared for by clinicians with no experience with SMI.

However, models from forensic and mental health research suggest that individuals with SMI are more likely to be engaged in shared decisionmaking when they are perceived as being able to contribute to treatment planning. 41 As liaisons between practitioners and systems of physical and mental health provision, CL psychiatrists can help medical providers reframe their assumptions about the care of individuals with SMI. Such psychoeducation can occur in a didactic frame, but also through the process of informal teaching through clinical consultation. 42 Patients should be assessed for capacity to participate in EOL treatment planning on an individual basis, independent on their underlying diagnosis. 43 and patients should be assessed for decisional capacity on an individual basis. 39 In addition, clinicians should avoid the tendency towards diagnostic overshadowing: attributing physical symptoms to mental illness. 43 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 93, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 334, "end": 336, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 531, "end": 533, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 823, "end": 825, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1158, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1310, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1391, "end": 1393, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1529, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Avoiding Assumptions"}, {"text": "Patients with SMI who become seriously medically ill are at risk of having minimal advance care planning in place.

These disparities may be reflected in lower rates of analgesia, loss of psychiatric services at the EOL, and high nursing home utilization. These disparities may emerge from siloes in medical and mental health care. Data show that many patients with SMI can participate in EOL decision-making. CL psychiatrists by virtue of their position at the interface of medicine and psychiatry and their familiarity with palliative care skills are ideally positioned to provide care to patients with SMI at the EOL. Going forward, the field of CL psychiatry should take a leadership role in addressing care disparities by leveraging its administrative and academic resources to study and implement new models of integrated EOL care.
