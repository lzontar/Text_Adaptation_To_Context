A deeper investigation of fuzzy transforms properties can be found in [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 19, 22] . In a recent article [9] , we demonstrated that the lower and upper fuzzy transforms can be introduced as two type of integral transforms, where the multiplication based fuzzy integral is applied [3, 4] . Namely, for a fuzzy measure space (X, F, \u03bc), an integral kernel K : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 L and a function f : X \u2192 L, where L is a complete residuated lattice, we proposed the integral transforms given by the following formulas:",

Together with the integral transform with the multiplication based fuzzy integral introduced in [9] we get a class of nonstandard integral transforms for the residuated lattice-valued functions based on fuzzy (or also qualitative) integrals that are often used in data processing. Note that the fuzzy integrals aggregate data and, in this way, provide summary information that is not directly visible from data. Obviously, the proposed integral transforms also provide an aggregation of function values, mainly, if the set Y has a significantly smaller size than the set X. This can be used, for example, in hierarchical decision making, classification problem or signal and image processing, where kernels can express relationships between different levels of criteria, object attributes and classes or introduce windows for some kind of filtering, respectively.",

The fuzzy relation K will be called the integral kernel, which corresponds to the standard notation in the theory of integral transforms. Note that the semi-normality in the second component of integral kernels is considered as a natural assumption avoiding the trivial case, namely, if K(x, y) = 0 for any x \u2208 X and some y \u2208 Y , we trivially obtain F \u2297 (K,\u2192DH) (f )(y) = 1 as a consequence of \u2192 DH 0 X d\u03bd = \u00ac0 = 1 (see Theorem 6(b)).

If an integral kernel K is normal in the second component for any y \u2208 Y and, moreover, the family of sets {Core (K(\u00b7, y) ) | y \u2208 Y } forms a partition of X, the family of fuzzy sets {K(\u00b7, y) | y \u2208 Y } is called a fuzzy partition of X, which is a crucial concept in the definition of lower and upper fuzzy transforms [20] . In this article, we significantly relax the concept of fuzzy partition because we require only that K(\u00b7, y) > 0 for any y \u2208 Y . Nevertheless, the fulfillment of certain integral transforms properties usually forces to introduce specific conditions for integral kernels (see Theorems 4.4 and 4.7 in [9] ).",
