With the spread of the virus, there are more and more false negative cases of RT-PCR nucleic acid detection in the early stage of potential infection. In this paper, we collected the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, outcomes, laboratory results and images of a SARS-CoV-2 carrier with no significant past medical history. The patient was quarantined because of her colleague had been diagnosed. After the onset of clinical symptoms, chest CT results showed patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) in her lungs, but it took a total of nine nucleic acid tests to confirm the diagnosis, among which the first eight RT-PCR results were negative or single-target positive. In addition to coughing up phlegm during her stay in the hospital, she did not develop chills, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other clinical symptoms. Since initial antiviral treatment, the lung lesions were absorbed. But the sputum nucleic acid test was still positive. In combination with antiviral and immune therapy, the patient tested negative for the virus. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was detected only in the lower respiratory tract samples (sputum) throughout the diagnosis and treatment period. This is a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with common symptoms, and her diagnosis has undergone multiple false negatives ,suggesting that it is difficult to identify certain carriers of the virus and that such patients may also increase the spread of the SARS-CoV-2.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December 2019 [1] , it has spread rapidly across the globe and has become a major public health emergency worldwide.

Subsequently, the results of two RT-PCR tests were negative.In order to further improve the relevant examination and treatment, the patient wastransferred to our hospital on February 21 for further isolation treatment. The tests of nucleic acid were still negative on February 22 and single-target positive on February 23. Until February 24, the ninth practical sputum nucleic acid test was positive, and the hospital confirmed COVID-19 infection to her clinical symptoms and laboratory test results. Nucleic acid tests were then performed on those who were in close contact with the patient. However, all results were negative. Clinical information and follow-ups This patient had no chronic history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, etc. At the time of admission, the patient presented acute symptoms, with body temperature at 36.6\u2103, pulse rate at 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate at 20 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/79mmHg, and subcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98.6%. No other abnormalities were detected in pneumonia-associated nucleic acid tests and respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid tests. The remaining laboratory results were shown in table 1. At the time of admission, the patient had been coughing for more than 20 days and had no symptoms of dyspnea, diarrhea or vomiting. There were no clinical symptoms such as fever, diarrhea and vomiting except cough during the hospitalization. The body temperature changes between admission and February 25 were shown in Fig 2.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "ACE2 is found mainly in type I epithelial cells and type II epithelial cells in the alveoli, and it is less abundant in cells such as airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages, so the amount of virus in the lower respiratory tract is significantly higher than that in the upper respiratory tract. Due to the reason that RT-PCR detection requires the cells containing a sufficient amount of virus, the virus-containing cells must be sampled when collecting specimens. Recent studies have shown that the viral load in sputum was greater than that in throat swabs[9]. The patient's RT-PCR positive nucleic acid samples during the hospitalization were all deep sputum collected after being atomized by 3% sodium chloride injection. Combined with the reported cases[10], it is suggested that the cause of several negative nucleic acid tests in highly suspected patients may be related to the sample collection site.Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher load in the upper respiratory tract [11], and the virus in the upper respiratory tract is more likely to fall off and spread, which may make it easier spread when asymptomatic. However, in the case of the patient, no virus was detected in samples other than sputum during the entire nucleic acid detection process. It can be seen that the virus in this patient mainly existed in the lower respiratory tract, and the viral load in the nasopharynx was low. It may also be one of the reasons accounting for its several false-positive RT-PCR tests and not infection of her close contacts. Similarly, no virus detected in anal swabs and stool that the virus did not infect the digestive tract, so the patient did not experience symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. But whether the distribution of the virus affects the spread of the virus needs more studies. Most notably, although the patient was undiagnosed by eight nucleic acid tests in this case, the patient's clinical manifestations, imaging examinations, and other laboratory tests showed that he had SARS-CoV-2 infection. For such multiple \"false positive\" cases, specific antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the patient's blood can be used as a supplement to nucleic acid detection. In the latest \"Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (Trial Version 7)\", it is mentioned that the serological antibody testing is used as the basis for diagnosis. COVID-19 is a new infectious disease and is throughout the course of disease same as SARS. The specific IgM of SARS-CoV mainly exists in the early and middle stages of infection and specific IgG mainly exists in the middle stage of infection and recovery period [12, 13]. Because SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the same family, the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may cause the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with negative nucleic acid tests. Therefore, the negative result of several nucleic acid tests may be due to the high specific IgM in the early stages of onset. The high specific IgM makes the SARS-CoV-2 low load in the body and amount of virus insufficient in the sample, leading to RT-PCR result is negative. But the virus does exist in the patient and is infectious at early stage. Considering that the production of specific antibodies takes time, and antibody detection is easily affected by rheumatoid factor, non-specific IgM, autoantibodies in blood samples, the RT-PCR result could be false positive. So even if the antibody is positive, continue to take samples to detect the viral nucleic acid. With the outbreak in many places around the world, more and more infected people, like the patients in this study, may have no obvious clinical symptoms or even no clinical symptoms after infection[14], and have negative or single-target positive", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "difficult to detect infections due to the reason that the clinical symptoms of the COVID-19 in the early stage of infection were mild or even absent. Such unknown infection has caused 79% of the overall infection [16], and is the main reason for the widespread spread of this virus. The patient in this case was isolated in a timely manner after her colleague was diagnosed, reducing the risk of transmission. Therefore, it can be seen that the follow-up of COVID-19 patients' contacts or experience areas is necessary to control the disease. Considering asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections, it is recommended that contacts of confirmed patients should be screened and tested for viral nucleic acid regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms, and preventive use of effective antiviral drugs for asymptomatic patients to reduce viral load and reduce the risk of virus transmission from asymptomatic carriers. Such measures may help control the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, it is not yet possible to determine whether patients have virus or are still infections in the recovery period although RT-PCR tests are negative. Therefore, it is recommended to increase the number of tests and the interval between each test.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "JL, Thornburg NJ, Gerber SI, Lloyd-Smith JO, de Wit E,Munster VJ., Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1.
