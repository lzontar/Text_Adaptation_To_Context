We aimed to identify all case-control studies investigating the potential role of respiratory viruses in the etiology of ARI in older adults aged \u226565 years. We conducted a systematic literature review (across 7 databases) of case-control studies published from 1996 to 2017 that investigated the viral profile of older adults with and those without ARI. We then computed a pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval and virus-specific attributable fraction among the exposed (AFE) for 8 common viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (Flu), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (RV), bocavirus (BoV), and coronavirus (CoV). From the 16 studies included, there was strong evidence of possible causal attribution for RSV (OR, 8.5 [95% CI, 3.9-18.5]; AFE, 88%), Flu (OR, 8.3 [95% CI, 4.4-15.9]; AFE, 88%), PIV (OR, not available; AFE, approximately 100%), HMPV (OR, 9.8 [95% CI, 2.3-41.0]; AFE, 90%), AdV (OR, not available; AFE, approximately 100%), RV (OR, 7.1 [95% CI, 3.7-13.6]; AFE, 86%) and CoV (OR, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.0-4.1]",

This review supports RSV, Flu, PIV, HMPV, AdV, RV, and CoV as important causes of ARI in older adults and provides quantitative estimates of the absolute proportion of virus-associated ARI cases to which a viral cause can be attributed.

Moreover, adults hospitalized with RSV disease can develop severe respiratory complications [5] . RV has been associated with severe respiratory disease outbreaks in adults in long-term care facilities in several settings [6] . Despite advances in diagnostic technology, defining the specific causes of viral pneumonia is challenging, particularly among older adults who may have lower viral loads and for whom viral diagnosis is frequently not considered and/ or testing is not performed [7] . Therefore, it is necessary to measure concurrently the background prevalence of nasopharyngeal viral infection in a control (asymptomatic) group, to investigate the etiological role of viruses in older adults with ARI to help inform decisions on prevention and management strategies.",

The virus-specific attributable fraction among the exposed (AFE) was used to quantify the etiological role of each virus in patients with ARI. This is an estimate of the percentage of ARIs that can be attributed to each virus, in absolute terms [14] , and was calculated as 100 * [OR \u2212 1]/OR, with a 95% CI (from the corresponding 95% CI of the OR). Moreover, for a specific virus, if all included studies did not report any virus detection in one group consistently (usually the control group), we assumed that a strong association indicating a possible causal role for this virus in ARI could be concluded. In these circumstances, we considered that there was no need to run a meta-analysis that would only result in an extremely high OR point estimate and an AFE approaching 100%.",

The meta-estimate OR was higher in industrialized countries as compared to developing countries in the case of Flu (with overlapping 95% CIs), while it was similar for PIV, AdV, and RV. There were insufficient studies to conduct a similar subgroup analysis for other viruses. A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the roles of these common viruses in older adults admitted to hospitals with ARI or pneumonia [1, 16, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28] . Eight studies were included, and results are presented in Supplementary Table 4 . The meta-estimate OR did not differ significantly from the previous estimate, in which cases from other settings (ie, outpatient and general practice settings) were also included. and CoV in ARI and pneumonia in older adults, thereby indicating a potential for substantive reductions in the number of ARI cases if older adults were vaccinated against these viruses or treated with antivirals. For the other respiratory viruses studied, the role of BoV in ARI and pneumonia was uncertain because of the limited evidence available from the published literature, requiring more research to clarify its role in older adults with ARI. A sensitivity analysis focusing only on older adults who were admitted to hospitals with ARI or pneumonia did not differ significantly from our estimate, in which patients from all settings were considered. This might result from the limited number of studies available to provide a more robust sensitivity analysis. No studies calculated adjusted ORs to account for confounding effects from age or season, which might compromise the actual association and should be considered in the study design in future research.",

The EPIC (Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community) study team showed that the viruses were detected in 26% of adults who had been hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, compared with 73% of children who were admitted to the hospital [1, 33] . There are several reasons for such low levels of detection, such as the inability to obtain lower respiratory tract specimens, the use of diagnostic tests with insufficient sensitivity, the absence of appropriate diagnostic testing methods, the undetectability of the virus at the time of the study, and the presence of unknown pathogens that were not identified. The low rate of virus detection among adults who were hospitalized for pneumonia highlights the need for more-sensitive diagnostic approaches, innovative discovery of pathogens, and assessing viruses in the past history (weeks before the presence of disease) [34] . Moreover, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is a very important cause of ARIs and hospital admissions [35] . Only 7 of 16 studies included COPD in the etiologic data, and this information was unclear in the remaining studies, which might have underestimated the role of viral infection in these patients.",

Although a thorough search has been performed across 7 databases, including 3 Chinese-language databases, only 16 studies from the published literature were identified, which met our selection criteria. Not every virus of interest was tested in each study. The number of studies available was even smaller when subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed. Moreover, the sample size varied from 50 to 2320 adults in the case group and from 27 to 541 adults in the control group. The small sample size undoubtedly contributed to the imprecise 95% CIs around the ORs. Thus, we may have failed to detect clinically significant ARI-virus associations, owing to small sample sizes.",

Among them, cases were recruited from inpatients, outpatients, emergency departments, or general practices, which might reflect different healthcare behavior and disease severity. Also, since the episodes of ARI and pneumonia were only diagnosed through routine care, this introduced bias, considering that testing was only done when the clinicians deemed it necessary to test. Similarly, 5 studies used community-based controls, while another 11 studies recruited older adult controls from hospitals or general practices. Hospital or clinical ascertained controls may not reflect the general population and may have other health conditions potentially affecting their viral carriage. Moreover, recruiting controls who were selected as healthy or without respiratory symptoms could favor those who were not exposed to the respiratory virus (yielding a falsely high OR). Therefore, we consider that the ideal control group for these studies would be a random sample of an age-and sexmatched population of older adults who are from the same area of residence and studied at the same time as cases.",

High sensitivity is important for accurate assessment of etiological contribution, particularly in older adults who may have a lower nasopharyngeal viral load and an atypical clinical presentation [7] . Moreover, despite being uncommon, detection of viral coinfection (range across studies, 1%-10%) may tend to overstate the contribution of individual respiratory viruses (although dual or multiple infections, in which both or several viruses have etiological importance, are possible). Bacterial coinfections (range across studies, 15%-26%) were also reported.

The detection of viruses in control groups without respiratory symptoms might be due to a nascent infection or a persisting colonization from a previous infection [40] . These factors will tend to result in true associations being attenuated. The fact that molecular detection of viruses in older adults with ARI is higher than the detection rate in controls without respiratory symptoms may not necessarily indicate causation. Alternative explanations should be considered first before causality can be concluded. These include the respiratory viral infection acting as a so-called innocent bystander, without a causal role, and serving only as a predisposing risk factor for ARI. Similarly, the absence of a positive association (and AFE) does not mean that a virus is not a cause of ARI. Moreover, without establishing the temporal sequence of exposure and outcome, determinations of causality are less secure. Therefore, the association between viruses and ARI and pneumonia should be interpreted carefully.",
