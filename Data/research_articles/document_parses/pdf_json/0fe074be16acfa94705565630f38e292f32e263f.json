For example, the superparamagnetic particles can be remotely manipulated by a permanent magnet or an electromagnet located offchip, allowing users to run dedicated tests in single-use disposables at low cost. Because the magnetic interaction is unaffected by surface charges, pH, ionic strength or temperature, it is compatible with a wide range of substrate materials and (bio)chemical processes.

Interfacing the RNA sample preparation with real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR) makes the bioassay superior to tests currently marketed. (At present, the following RT-PCR kits for identifying H5N1 are commercially available: LightMix Kit for Influenza virus A H5, N1, M2 and H5N1 (TIB MOLBIOL/Roche), Avian Flu H5N1 RT-PCR Kit (1-step) (Veredus Laboratories), artus Influenza H5 LC RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen), and TaqMan Influenza A/H5 Kit v1.0 (Applied Biosystems).

Encapsulating the droplet in mineral oil both reduces the friction between the aqueous droplet and the solid surface and prevents the evaporation of the aqueous phase. The volume ratio of the aqueous phase and the mineral oil is 100:1 for biochemical processes at room temperature and 1:5 for processes that require temperatures of up to 100 1C. Similar to a biphasic segmented flow in microchannels, the aqueous phase glides on a thin film of mineral oil 25 . This thin film is essential for handling highly viscous body fluids, such as a feces suspension, saliva or whole blood. Aside from their role as force mediators for manipulating the droplet in a magnetic field ( Fig. 1b-g) , the superparamagnetic particles serve temporarily as a solid phase for biochemical processes ( Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 1 online) . Pulling the superparamagnetic particles out of the aqueous droplet during solid-phase extraction (SPE) requires raising their concentration by 1,000-2,500% to overcome the resistance imposed by the surface tension of the aqueous droplet. Owing to an inherent property of magnetic forces, the actuation of the droplet is distant from the surface, making it possible to place the droplet on a chip, run a dedicated test and then dispose of the chip. To perform temperature-controlled biochemical processes in real time within a droplet, the chip is placed on a microfabricated heater 26 with an integrated optical detection system 27 .",

The mineral oil prevents the aqueous phase from evaporating at temperatures of up to 150 1C. options for desorbing the RNA from the superparamagnetic particles: decreasing the ionic strength of the solution by eluting in water, or increasing the pH value and/or temperature of the solution 28 . Elution first into water and then into the RT-PCR solution would involve an additional step. Because the RT is usually carried out at a pH above 8.4 and at temperatures above 50 1C, it is more convenient to directly release the immobilized RNA into the droplet containing the RT-PCR mixture at processing temperature. However, the procedures show no difference with respect to their cycle threshold (C T ) in the subsequent RRT-PCR that targets the hemagglutinin (HA) segment of HPAI H5N1 (data not shown). The droplet-based SPE recovery of 1-50 RNA copies from the throat swab sample is a linear curve and shows an optimal PCR efficiency ( Fig. 2) , indicating that RNA is quantitatively reisolated and of high purity. The high yield and purity is attributable to the fact that there is no loss of material due to nonspecific adsorption to the substrate surface, because the RNA remains adsorbed to the superparamagnetic particles during the SPE. Potential contaminants, which could interfere with the PCR, remain in the Lysis/Binding Solution droplet (see Fig. 1 ). In addition, the surface-bound RNA is washed four times with 10 ml of washing solution. With a 1:100 volume ratio of the superparamagnetic particles to washing solution, the remaining impurities are diluted 100 million-that is, (1/100) 4 -times.",

To minimize the RT-PCR run time, each thermocycling step is shortened by decreasing the holding time and/ or increasing the temperature, but this is done without compromising the PCR product specificity, yield and efficiency. Because we continuously monitor the fluorescence signal and the temperature within the droplet during the PCR, the thermocycling conditions can be optimized over the course of one experiment (Fig. 3) . Shorter thermocycles are preferable for reducing the thermal burden on the DNA polymerase. Rather moderate heating and cooling rates of + 11.5 1C/s and -5.6 1C/s, respectively, are a compromise between the low total mass of the thermocycler (36 mg) and the low heat conductivity of the disposable chip material. However, using a disposable chip avoids cross-contamination and keeps operational costs low. Although the passive cooling makes up 27% of the overall process time, we abstain from active cooling to reduce the overall power consumption. The overall RT-PCR run time for an experiment that uses a SYBR Green-based format with an antibody-modified hotstart polymerase is 21 min 40 s. Run times can be further shortened by using a two-step, rather than a three-step, thermocycling protocol and by reducing the difference between consecutive temperatures.",

The PCR efficiency over a dynamic range of six orders of magnitude is 93% (Fig. 4) , whereby the correlation coefficient of 0.999 indicates the linearity of the linear regression fit. If the RT-PCR is carried out in 50-ml volumes in a conventional thermocycler, the PCR efficiency is close to 100% (data not shown). We hypothesize that the PCR efficiency in our system is affected by the evaporation of water from the RT-PCR buffer at elevated temperatures, which causes the relative concentration of the RT-PCR components to deviate from their optimal values. But because we only use an RT-PCR volume of 500 nl, the cost of a reaction is 2,000-5,000% lower than that of commercially available H5N1 tests, which rely on 20-50 ml buffer per RT-PCR cycle.",

This is about 440% faster than current H5N1 tests on the market that take around 4 h. Point-of-care tests in low-resource settings demand low-cost, easyto-use hand-held units that are ideally composed of an instrument and a disposable component. The basic design of our prototype instrument for the most part relies on that of a CD-ROM drive ( Supplementary Fig. 5 online) , making use of its power supply, its spindle stepper motor for microfluidic actuation and its optics for fluorescence detection. At present, we are working on the implementation of a second optical channel for an internal control that allows the user to check on the SPE of the RNA as well as for possible PCR inhibition.

Aside from its being interfaced with sample preparation, the assay was as sensitive as, and 440% faster and 2,000-5,000% more economical than, other available tests. This strategy not only is applicable for this particular assay, but could easily be adapted for other infectious diseases, such as SARS, HIV and hepatitis B, by extracting nucleic acids from other body fluids, such as blood, urine or saliva. Because an increasing number of magnetic particle-based biochemical kits are now commercially available for the processing of cells, RNA, DNA and proteins, we envision the microfluidic system described here to be an attractive diagnostic platform, especially for decentralized environmental, biological or medical testing.",
