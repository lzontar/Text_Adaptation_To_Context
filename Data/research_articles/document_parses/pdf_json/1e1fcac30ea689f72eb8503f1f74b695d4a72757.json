This is because Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, is the administrative center of Hubei province and the majority of the population displaced from Wuhan have temporarily relocated to other areas of Hubei. But contrary to the initial wave of cases, an increasing number of patients have been diagnosed outside Wuhan and/or Hubei province, many of whom did not have close contact with people from Wuhan. These patients were more likely to have been infected by secondary or tertiary transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Other investigators have assumed that the high percentage of patients with Wuhan-related exposure (indicating potentially higher virulence) drove the severe situation in Hubei. 6 Exploring the difference between patients in and outside the highly endemic area, as well as by primary and progeny virus, may help clinicians better appreciate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and lead to more efficient allocation of healthcare resources. In addition, the exploration of the driving forces underlying these observations such as virus virulence and temporary shortage of health resources may help inform clinical practice and disease prevention.

Major disagreement between two reviewers was resolved by consultation with the third reviewer.

We compared the differences in clinical characteristics and treatments. In terms of prognosis, the primary endpoint was critical illness including admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death.

Similarly, Hubei patients (7.3% vs. 0.3%, P<0.001) and patients with Wuhan-related exposure (3.6% vs. 0.8%, P=0.017) had a higher mortality rate. After adjusting for age and comorbidity, the Cox regression model without PH assumption violation revealed that patients in Hubei province (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.05-2.41; P=0.027, figure 4A ) and those with Wuhan exposure history (HR 1.34, 95%CI 0.70-2.57; P=0.385, figure 4B ) were more likely to reach critical illness.

Summarizing the experience from China and providing in-depth understanding of the situation in the previous epicenter can help to improve the strategy in the current epicenters. For the situation outside of the epicenter Hubei, two studies presented characteristics and outcomes among patients outside Hubei in Shenzhen and Zhejiang, however, the sample size is small therefore, comparison to Hubei patients cannot be performed. 9,10 To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide study in China investigating the differences in the clinical characteristics and the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 between both those in and outside of Hubei province, and those with and without Wuhanrelated exposure. We believe that our core cohort could partially represent the overall situation as of Jan 31 st , taking into account the patient number (13.4% of all cases) and the broad coverage (covering almost all major provinces/cities/autonomous regions). Moreover, this dataset showed consistent epidemiological characteristics with the surveillance dataset, indicating that it represented the real-world conditions. Compared with those with contact history with people from Wuhan or living in Hubei province, patients without Wuhan-related exposure or living outside of Hubei were younger, had fewer comorbidities, less abnormal chest radiographic manifestations, and slightly lower symptom burden. These findings suggested a potentially augmented infectivity in the general population beyond fragile individuals (i.e., the elderly). This is in agreement with the median reproduction number (R0), which has increased from 2.0 in early studies to 3.8 in more recent studies. 11, 12 In addition, viral genome sequencing of cases from Hubei province and other regions/countries has also lent support to the continuous revolution in the viral functional regions that facilitates its transmission among the human population (self-adaptation). 13 However, we should be cautious about the bias resulting from the undiagnosed cases in the early phase of transmission when most people were not aware of this disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1949, "end": 1952, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1955, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2215, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It has been believed that the onward transmission of a virus might result in attenuated disease. 14, 15 Our results showed fewer severe events and a lower mortality rate among patients outside of Hubei province and patients that had no history of Wuhan-related exposure. However, these results might have been biased by the temporary shortage of health resources, such as the limited hospital performance and detection capacity, that resulted from the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei. After the surge of cases in January 2020, hospitals in Hubei province were heavily overloaded and managed an overwhelming increase in the number of patients.

Importantly, we have found that the prolonged waiting time, rather than the geographic location or the Wuhan-related exposure history, predicted the clinical prognosis of COVID-19. We speculated that some patients from Wuhan traveled to other cities outside of Hubei province seeking more timely treatment. These patients reported a similar waiting time and medical care records, which translated into a similar prognosis with the local residents. Consistently, the incidence of severe cases and mortality continuously decreased (figure S1) since clinicians, nurses, and medical instruments have been dispatched to Hubei province.

Third, we cannot evaluate the exact healthcare capacity of each hospital but used a duration from symptom onset to admission as an indirect measure. Fourth, only a small proportion of patients had Wuhan exposure history, which may give a non-balanced result with some possible bias. Fifth, some other factors that may have impact on the prognosis, e.g. secondary infection, cannot be evaluated in this study.
