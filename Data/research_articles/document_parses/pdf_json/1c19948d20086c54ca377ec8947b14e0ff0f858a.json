Time series analysis is of great importance to determine both the similarity in the behavior of COVID-19 in certain countries/states and the establishment of models that can analyze and predict the transmission process of this infectious disease. In this contribution, an analysis of the different states of the United States will be carried out to measure the similarity of COVID-19 time series, using dynamic time warping distance (DTW) as a distance metric. A parametric methodology is proposed to jointly analyze infected and deceased persons. This metric allows to compare time series that have a different time length, making it very appropriate for studying the United States, since the virus did not spread simultaneously in all the states/provinces. After a measure of the similarity between the time series of the states of United States was determined, a hierarchical cluster was created, which makes it possible to analyze the behavioral relationships of the pandemic between different states and to discover interesting patterns and correlations in the underlying data of COVID-19 in the United States. With the proposed methodology, nine different clusters were obtained, showing a different behavior in the eastern zone and western zone of the United States. Finally, to make a prediction of the evolution of COVID-19 in the states, Logistic, Gompertz and SIR model was computed.

Clustering time series is usually an unsupervised process, with the aim of finding behavioral similarities between the different time series that are analyzed. This article has proposed a parametric metric, based on the dynamic time warping distance, in order to measure the distance or similarity between time series corresponding to different states in the United States, taking simultaneously into account the behavior of the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deceased persons due to COVID-19 . The proposed parametric metric, named \u221d ( , ), is robust to the different lengths of data sequences (different beginning of the epidemic in the different states of the United States).Using the Calinski-Harabasz criterion, the optimal number of clusters in which the different states of United States can be grouped was obtained, taken as value of \u03b1 = 0.5 (same relevance for the time series of confirmed and death patients). A total of 9 heterogeneous clusters were found, in the sense that there are clusters within a large number of states (there are two large clusters, which encompass 18 and 14 states) and other clusters with only one state (indicating that their behavior has been unique, as they do not have excessive similarities with the rest of states).Logistic, Gompertz and SIR mathematical models have been analyzed for the prediction and modeling of the evolution of the epidemic in the different states. For each of the clusters obtained, a representative state is selected and the SIR model was computed. This mathematical model, widely used in the bibliography, allows prediction of the evolution in a given state of the evolution of number of susceptible, infected and recovered patients, being this evolution and the estimate of the final size of the COVID-19 epidemic very relevant for the health authorities.With the proposed hierarchical clustering procedure, it is possible to identify and summarize interesting patterns and correlations in the underlying data of the time series of the states of United States suffering COVID-19 and therefore determine similar behaviors that different states may have.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}]}
