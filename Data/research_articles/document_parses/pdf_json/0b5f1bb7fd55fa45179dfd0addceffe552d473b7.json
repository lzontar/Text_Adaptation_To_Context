However, the toxic nature of these structures poses a threat to highly vascularized tissues, such as the lungs. Here, we identified a cell-intrinsic program that modified the neutrophil proteome in the circulation and caused the progressive loss of granule content and reduction of the NET-forming capacity. This program was driven by the receptor CXCR2 and by regulators of circadian cycles. As a consequence, lungs were protected from inflammatory injury at times of day or in mouse mutants in which granule content was low. Changes in the proteome, granule content and NET formation also occurred in human neutrophils, and correlated with the incidence and severity of respiratory distress in pneumonia patients. Our findings unveil a 'disarming' strategy of neutrophils that depletes protein stores to reduce the magnitude of inflammation.",

They accumulate receptors, proteases, antimicrobial peptides and proteins inside cytoplasmic granules that mediate the production of reactive oxygen species or DNA-based extracellular traps (NETs), both of which are highly toxic and allow for effective containment of pathogens 1, 2 . Several types of granules coexist in the neutrophil cytoplasm 3 , including primary (azurophilic) granules that store myeloperoxidase (MPO), secondary (specific) and tertiary (gelatinase) granules and secretory vesicles, each of which carry distinct types of cargo 1, 4 . The different granules form at different stages of granulopoiesis in the bone marrow 5, 6 , and the synthesis of granule proteins declines as neutrophils differentiate 7, 8 . In contrast, receptors needed for sensing, migration and phagocytosis are mostly synthesized once they reach the circulation 7, 8 .",

However, this does not imply immediate elimination, as they can be found within the vessels or parenchyma of multiple organs, with a preference for the spleen, bone marrow and lungs 10 . The homeostatic infiltration of granule-laden neutrophils, a process enabled by a cell-intrinsic program that relies on the chemokine receptor CXCR2 and the core clock protein Bmal1 (ref. 12 ), can be potentially damaging to highly vascularized tissues such as the lungs. Indeed, lungs are highly susceptible to neutrophil-mediated damage, which can cause respiratory dysfunction and death, as shown in murine models of lung injury [13] [14] [15] . In humans, neutrophil-mediated acute vascular damage followed by pulmonary edema and distress is common in patients with underlying pneumococcal infections or other pre-existing conditions 13, 16 .",

However, because transcriptional changes take a relatively long time (in the range of hours) and diurnal transcriptional programs in mouse neutrophils favor their migration into tissues, we examined alternative mechanisms that might protect the tissues from the toxic activity of neutrophils. We undertook a proteomic approach to explore the changes in protein content in neutrophils at different times after their release from the bone marrow. Because the number of neutrophils that can be purified from the blood of na\u00efve mice at night (when neutrophils are released from the bone marrow) or at noon (when neutrophils have spent several hours in the circulation) 17 is low, we increased the number of night-like neutrophils released from the bone marrow by a one-time intraperitoneal injection at zeitgeber time 4 (ZT4, or 4 h after lights on) of AMD3100, an antagonist for CXCR4 that induces the rapid mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow 18 . To increase the number of day-like neutrophils in circulation we injected blocking antibodies against endothelial selectins (1 mg kg \u22121 , intravenously at ZT5 at days \u22125, \u22123 and \u22121 before collection) 12, 17 (Extended Data Fig. 1a) . The proteomic analysis of these night-and day-like neutrophils isolated at ZT5 from the blood of wild-type mice yielded 6,677 proteins (Supplementary Table 1 ). A total of 171 proteins were differentially detected when comparing the night-like versus the day-like group, with proteins involved in regulation of the cytoskeleton (Arghdib, Rufy3), adhesion (Thbs1, Itgam), inflammasome (Nlrp3, Nlrp4e) and vesicular transport (Vps33b) (Fig. 1a) enriched in night-like neutrophils compared to day-like neutrophils. The differential expression of identified proteins in night-versus day-like neutrophils, such as VEGFR1, CD74, CD16/32, CD63 or CD14, was confirmed by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 1b) . Gene ontology analyses (Supplementary Table 2 ) indicated involvement of the differentially expressed proteins in immune defense, cytokine signaling and angiogenesis (Extended Data Fig. 1c ). Night-like neutrophils were enriched for pathways linked to c-Kit signaling and platelet production, possibly reminiscent of their time in the bone marrow, as well as GTPase Rho signaling (Fig. 1b) , consistent with the enhanced migratory capacity of 'younger' neutrophils 12 . Day-like neutrophils showed upregulation of protein synthesis, pathogen sensing and respiration (Fig. 1b) , suggesting specialization for effector functions and enhanced TLR signaling, as previously suggested 12, 19 . Comparison of the neutrophil proteome with transcriptional datasets associated with diurnal time 12 showed poor correlation (Extended Data Fig. 1d) , suggesting that the proteomic changes are not driven by direct transcriptional regulation. These results therefore identify prominent changes in the neutrophil proteome that are associated with the time spent in the circulation.",

To assess if these variations in side scatter were caused by degranulation, we stained cytospins of Ly6G + blood neutrophils purified at the same times as for MPO, a protein of azurophilic granules, and analyzed granule content by high-resolution confocal microscopy (Fig. 1d) . The maximal abundance of MPO + granules was observed at ZT17 (midnight, when neutrophils leave the marrow), while the valley was at ZT1 (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2c ), indicating progressive loss of primary granules. MPO + granule content in neutrophils was in antiphase with elastase activity in plasma (Fig. 1f) , suggesting the release of granule content into blood. A 12-h shift in the animal light cycle for three weeks completely readjusted the pattern of granule content in neutrophils (Extended Data Fig. 2d ), indicating that degranulation was circadian in nature. Finally, Ly6G + neutrophils from lungs, spleen and liver had a lower MPO + granule content compared to Ly6G + neutrophils in the blood (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f) .",

Proteases stored in the azurophilic granules degrade the nuclear histones and promote chromatin decondensation during NET formation 20 and granule proteins have been identified in the NET proteome 21 . Among the proteins found in the proteomic analyses, those associated with NETs (Supplementary table 3) were enriched in the proteome of night-like neutrophils (Fig. 2a) , suggesting that NET release is more prevalent at this time. To directly examine whether the formation of NETs varied during the course of a day, we treated Ly6G + neutrophils purified at ZT5 or ZT13 from the blood of wild-type mice with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a NET-inducing compound, and analyzed for the presence of extracellular DNA decorated with MPO protein and citrullinated histone 3 (cit-H3). We found that neutrophils at ZT13 (night) formed more NETs than at ZT5 (daytime) (Fig. 2b) , revealing a correlation between diurnal azurophilic granule content and NET-forming capacity in blood Ly6G + neutrophils. Next, we assessed the presence of NETs by whole-mount immunostaining with the same markers in cremaster muscles of wild-type and Lyz2 Cre Mcl1 fl/fl mice, which are neutropenic 22 , after ischemia-reperfusion. Many more NETs were detectable in the muscles of mice at ZT13 than at ZT5, while no NETs were detected in the Lyz2 Cre Mcl1 fl/fl mice (Fig. 2c) . Thus, proteomic changes and degranulation of circulating neutrophils temporally coincide with loss of NET-forming ability.",

Diurnal changes in neutrophil transcription and migration are controlled by a cell-intrinsic mechanism, in which the expression of the chemokine Cxcl2 is regulated by the molecular clock protein Bmal1 and leads to the cell-autonomous, diurnal activation of neutrophils by signaling through CXCR2 (ref. 12 ). We therefore tested whether this mechanism caused the proteome changes. Treatment with CXCL2 induced degranulation in isolated wild-type Ly6G + , circulating neutrophils (Fig. 3a) . Analysis of the granule content of blood neutrophils from MRP8 CRE Cxcr2 fl/fl (referred to as CXCR2 \u0394N hereafter) 12 , which have a neutrophil-specific deficiency in CXCR2, at ZT5 and ZT13, showed no differences in MPO + granule content or in sidescatter properties in blood neutrophils, compared with neutrophils from wild-type mice ( Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 2b ). CXCR2 \u0394N neutrophils degranulated in response to PMA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b) , indicating that degranulation could be induced in these cells. We also found a loss of diurnal oscillations in granule content in blood neutrophils from Cxcl2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3b) . Neutrophils from CXCR2 \u0394N and Cxcl2 \u2212/\u2212 mice also showed no differences in NET formation between ZT5 and ZT13 (Fig. 3c) . In chimeric mice transplanted with equal mixes of bone marrow from DsRed + wild-type and Cxcl2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, Cxcl2 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils had a higher granule content than wild-type neutrophils analyzed at the same time (ZT5; Fig. 3d ), suggesting that CXCL2 signaled in neutrophils in an autocrine fashion to control granule content.",

To test whether the diurnal changes in the neutrophil proteome influenced the outcome of inflammatory responses in tissues, we used a model of endotoxin and antibody-induced acute lung inflammation (ALI) 15, 23 , which is dependent on neutrophils and NETs [24] [25] [26] , and recapitulates the pulmonary injury observed in transfused patients 27 . We used ALI-prone Balb/c mice, which displayed normal diurnal variations in neutrophil number and phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 5a-c) 12 . Lungs from Balb/c mice treated to induce ALI (by intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mg kg \u22121 LPS 24 h before intravenous injection of 0.5 mg kg \u22121 of an anti-H2d antibody) showed evidence of NETs, defined by staining for MPO, DNA and cit-H3 ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2) 24, 26 . To assess the kinetics of NET formation in vivo during ALI, we performed high-speed multichannel intravital imaging of the lung microcirculation 28 . Neutrophils were identified by Ly6G staining, while NET-like structures where identified by the rapid extrusion of Sytox-green-labeled DNA from Ly6G + neutrophils, as a result of intravenous injection of the The Sytox-green + extrusions were inhibited by the PAD4 inhibitor chloramidine injected intravenously 1 h before induction of ALI (Fig. 4c) , indicating that they represented NETs. Continuous tracking of neutrophil behavior for 40 min showed higher release of Sytox-green + extrusions at ZT13 compared with ZT5 ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Video 3). The enhanced NET production at night was detectable minutes after induction of ALI and was sustained for the rest of the experiment (Fig. 4c) . In contrast, the number of Ly6G + neutrophils was similar at ZT5 and ZT13 in untreated and in chloramidine-treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 6a -c). Because platelets have been involved in neutrophil activation and NET formation during ALI 15,25 , we assessed their possible involvement in the observed differences between ZT5 and ZT13. We found a sharp increase in the number of platelets in the pulmonary vessels in mice with ALI; however, their numbers were comparable at ZT5 and ZT13 (Extended Data Fig. 6b) , suggesting that the number of neutrophils or platelets did not influence the diurnal changes in pulmonary NET formation.",

Intravenous injection with Evans blue dye after ALI induction at ZT5 indicated a marked increase in pulmonary vascular permeability during ALI, compared to LPS-only treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 7a) , which was specific to the lungs. We then used computerized tomography (CT) to track the in vivo dynamics of edema in mice in which we induced ALI at ZT5 (day) or at ZT13 (night). We found a rapid and sharp increase in water content of the lungs, which occurred earlier and was higher in ZT13-compared with ZT5-induced mice (Fig. 4d,e) . This correlated with reduced survival of mice in which ALI was induced at ZT13 compared to those induced at ZT5 (Fig. 4f) . Finally, treatment with chloramidine 1 h before induction at ZT5 protected mice from edema and death (Fig. 4e,f) , indicating that the release of NETs was a primary cause of ALI. Thus, the severity of lung injury during ALI displays diurnal patterns that correlate with the granule content and the capacity of neutrophils to form NETs. , and enrichment of these proteins in nighttime neutrophils. b, Ex vivo NET-formation assay. Neutrophils sorted at ZT13 (nighttime) or ZT5 (daytime) were stimulated with PMA or vehicle to induce NETs and were stained for cit-H3 and DNA (left).

Gene ontology analyses revealed that the differentially detected proteins were in pathways related to vesicle-mediated transport, secretion, exocytosis or degranulation (Extended Data Fig. 9b and Supplementary Table 7) , consistent with a loss of granule content in human neutrophils over time. Many of the individual proteins identified in the mouse analyses were not detected or did not show diurnal changes in the human samples (not shown), probably indicating a high variability among humans compared with co-housed and strain-matched mice. However, numerous granule proteins, such as MPO, MMP9 or LTF, were more abundant at 8:00 than at 14:00 in human neutrophils (Fig. 6g) . Similar to mouse neutrophils, there was a poor correlation between transcript and protein amounts in human neutrophils (Extended Data Fig. 9c) , suggesting that the proteomic changes were largely independent of transcriptional regulation. Ex vivo assays of human neutrophils purified using density gradients and treated with vehicle or PMA indicated a marked reduction in NET-forming capacity between 8:00 and 14:00 (Fig. 6h,i) , corresponding with more NETrelated proteins at 8:00 compared with 14:00 (Extended Data Fig. 9d) .

We focused on an existing cohort of 5,334 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, who are at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 32 . Retrospective analysis of the human cohort indicated that, among the patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, 125 (2.3%) developed ARDS. Assessment of the temporal patterns of disease onset and severity (using the pneumonia severity index), by plotting the times of admission against the pneumonia index and death in this subset of patients, revealed consistent diurnal oscillations, with a peak around 9:00 and a trough at 17:00-19:00 for both parameters (Fig. 6j) . These observations indicate that proteomic disarming occurs in human neutrophils and may influence the incidence and severity of inflammation (Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Video 6).",

The phenomenon of proteome disarming described here shares key features with the process of neutrophil 'aging' 12 , in terms of reliance on CXCR2 signaling, regulation by Bmal1 and CXCR4 in a cell-intrinsic manner and similar temporal patterns (that is, peak at noon). This suggested that neutrophil aging and disarming might represent distinct manifestations of a core circadian program in neutrophils that allows anticipation of potential threats 12 , but also protects from excessive inflammation, vascular damage and death.",

The circadian transcriptional regulation of migration-associated genes by Bmal1 controls the migratory properties of neutrophils, and allows the infiltration of na\u00efve tissues in anticipation of potential infections 12 . In addition to these transcription-mediated mechanisms, we uncovered here that the neutrophil proteome is also subject to circadian regulation, which blunts the ability of neutrophils to release toxic mediators and to produce NETs. This level of immune regulation may be particularly relevant for granulocytes, a group of innate immune cells that synthesize and store the majority of their early-response mediators inside dedicated organelles. Because the formation of granules and their content occurs as neutrophils differentiate in the bone marrow 7,33 , it is unlikely that changes of the granule proteome that occur in the circulation are transcriptionally regulated, as illustrated by the poor correlation between the proteome and the transcriptome in these cells. Our data, however, suggested a model in which upstream control of transcription of Cxcl2 by Bmal1 (ref. 12 ) allowed indirect regulation of the neutrophil proteome by the canonical circadian machinery. Conceptually, the temporal nature of this process in blood aligns with the evolutionary value of circadian oscillations in segregating mutually antagonistic processes, in this case potent antimicrobial responses and protection of the host against immunemediated damage.",

Because neutrophil proteases are also important for the activation of many biological mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and adhesion and pattern-recognition receptors 34, 35 , and even modulate signaling cascades in other cells 36, 37 , the programmed proteome changes reported here may have pleiotropic consequences in physiology. For instance, they predict that neutrophils that are newly released from the bone marrow in conditions of stress, such as obesity or cancer 38,39 , may be better suited to regulate physiological aspects of target organs than the aged neutrophils that enter the tissues at the end of their life cycle and have lost part of their cargo. Our observations shed light into the particular susceptibility of the lungs to diurnal inflammation. Large numbers of neutrophils accumulate within the pulmonary microcirculation in mice, rabbits and nonhuman primates after stimulation or in the steady state 10, 18, 40 , and the lungs can provide a niche for effective antimicrobial responses 41 . The homeostatic accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs at the end of the light cycle in mice 10 would predict higher susceptibility to inflammatory stimuli at this time. However, we found that neutrophils recovered from na\u00efve lungs had reduced granularity, and that mutant mice with constitutive low levels of granules in neutrophils displayed permanent protection from ALI, suggesting a dominant contribution of the disarming process in tissue protection.",

Data from ARDS were extracted from a prospective observational cohort study of 5,334 consecutive adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit who developed ARDS between 1996 and 2016 (ref. 32 ), in the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. The time of admission, severity and survival were determined for the 125 patients who developed ARDS. Patients were excluded if they had severe immunosuppression or active tuberculosis. ARDS was identified on the basis of the Berlin definition. Only time points with three or more data points were included in subsequent analyses. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (no. 2009/5451).",

Neutrophils from mouse and human blood were isolated as previously described (FACS sorting for mouse neutrophils, gradient isolation for human neutrophils), fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min and washed with PBS. Samples were then postfixed in distilled water containing 4% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in distilled water, samples were stained in a block with 0.5% uranyl acetate in water for 10 min. Then, samples were dehydrated in ascending gradients of ethanol in water (30%, 50%, 70%, 95% and 100%) with a last step in acetone. Samples were then included in epoxy resin (Durcupan) in ascending steps of resin:acetone (1:3, 3:1) and then pure resin. Samples included in the resin were polymerized for 48 h at 60 \u00b0C and 60-nm slices were obtained in a Leica Ultracut S ultramicrotome in 200-mesh copper gratings. Finally, samples were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were acquired in a 100-kV Jeol JEM-1010 TEM microscope with a Gatan SC200 camera coupled to the system. Quantification of granule-covered cytoplasmic area was performed in ImageJ using a custom-made macro that allows calculation of cell, nucleus and granule areas, and which is made available at https://doi. org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7619093.v1.",

Paired or unpaired two-tailed t-test was used when two groups were compared, and comparison of more than two datasets was done using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Turkey's posttest. Where applicable, normality was estimated using the D' Agostino-Pearson or Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Log-rank analysis was used for Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Sample exclusion was not performed unless evident signs of disease were found in a mouse. For determination of diurnal patterns, we performed COSINOR fitting of circadian curves 12 . To determine whether a diurnal curve displayed an oscillating pattern we used the COSINOR-calculated amplitudes and compared them with a hypothetical zero-amplitude curve (that is, with no circadian behavior) assuming that both curves have identical standard deviations. We finally compared the amplitudes of the two curves using unpaired two-tailed t-test analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism v.7 (GraphPad Software), except proteomics and sequencing analysis, which were performed using R (see individual methods). A P value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant; nonsignificant differences are indicated accordingly.",

All other code is available upon request. Fig. 10 | Graphical abstract. Neutrophils are released from the bone marrow into the bloodstream enriched in granule-held antimicrobial, cytotoxic and NET-forming proteins. As they spend time in the circulation, they undergo a homeostatic process of proteome 'disarming' that is regulated by the clock gene Bmal1 and signaling through CXCR2. This process causes a reduction in granule content and their ability to form NETs, ultimately reducing their toxicity towards host tissues. During acute lung injury, the presence of granule-poor neutrophils at specific times of day or in CXCR4 mutants protects the lungs and increases survival. Disabling homeostatic degranulation in Bmal1 mutants, in contrast, increases organ damage and death at all times of day.",

The protection from pathology correlated with preservation of vascular permeability in the lungs of CXCR4 \u0394N mice after intravenous injection of Evans blue (Extended DataFig. 7b,c).

The frequency of adherent NETs was elevated compared with flowing NETs in Bmal1 \u0394N mice, but not in wild-type or CXCR4 \u0394N mice (Extended DataFig. 7e), suggesting that the ability of neutrophils to deposit NETs onto the endothelium enhanced vascular damage in Bmal1 \u0394N mice.
