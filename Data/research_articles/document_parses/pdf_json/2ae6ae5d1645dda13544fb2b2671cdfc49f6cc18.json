Optometrists, whilst not considered frontline health care workers for COVID 19, may nonetheless, be exposed to asymptomatic patients or their close contacts. Therefore, they need to take precautions to protect themselves and others in their practices. Depending on local regulations, it is a sensible precaution to check the temperature of anyone entering the practice, including staff, and for all present to wear a surgical mask, and use hand sanitizers. Ideally, this should be supplemented with a face visor, as certain diagnostic procedures do require close contact with patients. In addition, ophthalmic instruments should be shielded as far as possible to prevent contamination and wiped down with disinfectant or alcohol after each patient. Clients may try on several frames when choosing new spectacles, so, although it is not normal practice to clean these after every customer, at this extraordinary time, all items that come into contact with potentially infected persons must be wiped with alcohol or equivalently effective method. This means that clients trying on frames must be supervised to ensure that frames tried by the clients can be identified for cleaning.",

The most frequent question regards the safety of wearing contact lenses for vision correction during the crisis. Contact lens wear itself is safe if there is strict compliance with care and wear routines. [10] This has not been changed by the pandemic. There is no definitive evidence so far of direct transmission via contact lenses. However, it is well recognized that contact lens patients are frequently not compliant [11] [12] [13] . In addition, contact lens wearers may experience minor discomfort or irritation more frequently than spectacle wearers [14] , and this in turn increases the chance of the natural response to touch or rub eyes [15] . This is especially true for patients who experience some dryness when using contact lenses. For these patients in particular, it may be prudent to switch to spectacles for this period. Alternatively, those who are more dependent on their contact lenses may consider wearing plano spectacles or sunglasses, in addition to their lenses, in public. Nevertheless, as spectacle wearers may also rub their eyes after removing their glasses, they also need to be reminded to avoid doing so.",

It appears to be relayed to an immense over response of the immune system to the infection, which is very difficult to treat. The authors consider a surge of severe pediatric cases of COVID 19 would be disastrous, in view of inadequate pediatric hospital care resources. This observation is likely to be the case in many other countries as well. At this time, it is essential to increase awareness of children wearing contact lenses for myopia control. These include J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f those wearing specialized soft contact lenses in the daytime and overnight orthokeratology. It is more difficult to impress on children the importance of not touching 'MEN'. Therefore, the case for temporary discontinuation of daytime lens wear at this time may be stronger, but the final decision must be made by the practitioner after careful consideration of the likelihood of good compliance and amount of time spent out of the home. In many places, schools are closed and time outdoors is strictly limited, reducing opportunities for contamination and infection. Once again, when outdoors, the risk can be ameliorated by the use of plano glasses or sunglasses with the contact lenses.",

Practitioners need to caution parents that extended hours of sleep with the orthokeratology lenses may lead to development of corneal oedema. This condition has been observed in a few children undergoing orthokeratology treatment just recently in Hong Kong. As patients may be unable to visit clinics or practices due to lockdown, it may be advisable for practitioners to contact the parents of all of their orthokeratology patients to alert them about this problem.
