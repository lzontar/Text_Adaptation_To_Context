Further biotechnological procedures allowed synthesizing, validating, and approving new biopharmaceutics, e. g., recombinant insulins (first approval by the FDA in 1982) [4] . This development was further fueled by the transfusion scandals of the 1980ies, accidental transmission of HIV or HCV to hemophilia patients and the contamination by Creutzfeld-Jakob in the context of pituitary extracts for growth hormone substitution. Also recombinant coagulation factors [5, 6] and growth hormone (approval by the FDA in 1985) [7, 8] were produced by means of biotechnology.",

In the former dual immunological conception of Th1/Th2 inflammations [9, 10] , recombinant cytokines were intended to restore the inflammatory balance, e. g., by application of recombinant IL-12 in cases of asthma [11] or e. g., IL-10 [12] and IL-11 [13] for psoriasis. In contrast as for example to interferon therapy for treatment of multiple sclerosis or viral hepatitis, those trials did not reach their endpoints consistently and someti-mes showed relevant side effects. Hence, these therapeutic approaches have not been pursued. Beside the possible variety of biologically potentially applicable therapeutic proteins, at the same time a high range of biotechnological expression systems has been developed [14] . After initial prokaryotic systems, successively eukaryotic expression systems have been developed that made available also larger and glycosylated proteins with complex tertiary and quaternary structure in reproducibly high and therapeutic quality. Even with regard to optimization of therapeutic antibodies to target epitopes and the development of extraction processes, enormous pioneering work was done [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

The first therapeutic antibodies were developed as chimeric proteins with relatively high murine or other xenobiological portions and increasingly humanized. This led to a significantly improved tolerance, effectiveness, and safety for the patients. This development is also reflected in the nomenclature of the biologics: The anti-CEA antibody arcitumomab approved in 1996 was only murine, the therapeutic TNF-\u03b1 antibody Infliximab, approved in 1999, was a chimeric antibody, the herceptin antibody trastuzumab and the anti-IgE antibody omalizumab were humanized antibodies, and the TNF-\u03b1 antibody adalimumab was completely human (\u25b6Fig. 1 and [21] ).",

            "text": "Beside an intended immunological effect, usually an undesired immunological reaction occurs on biologically active and mostly exogenous substances in the recipient or host organism, which is called immunogenicity. The murine or xenobiological portions on the one hand and the glycosylation pattern on the other hand determine significantly the immunogenicity of the active biological substance. This leads to for example ADAs (anti-drug antibodies) that at best are neutralizing and lead to ineffectiveness of the applied biological drug, but also potentially to immunological phenomena such as autoimmune hemolysis, cytokine release syndrome, mast cell activation, immune complex hypersensitivity and serum disease. Examples in this context are the relatively high rates of reactions against infliximab or rituximab, which consist of a significant murine proportion [22, 23] . Finally, those biologically active substances are complex, large, biotechnologically produced pharmaceutics. Methodological details during production as well as cooling, light, pH, transportation, and application may lead to small molecular changes with potential alterations, such as loss of effectiveness, molecular aggregates, and increased immunogenicity. Furthermore, crossreacting epitopes may lead to fatal anaphylaxis, especially when the antigens share amino acid sequences with IgE epitopes, e. g., cetuximab.",

Since the publication of pivotal trials on combination therapy, it is also applied for advanced head and neck carcinomas [24] [25] [26] . Already during approval studies in the early 2000ies, regional differences became apparent in the USA with regard to the incidence of anaphylactic reactions. In 2007, O'Neil could show that the first administration of the drug had a global probability of less than 3 % to develop anaphylactic reactions. In the middle southeast of the USA, however, e. g., in Virginia, this rate amounted to up to 20 % [27, 28] . This reaction is of completely different nature compared to the relatively frequent cutaneous reactions [29] . In 2013, Platt-Mills and colleagues could clarify the mechanism of sensitization and association with tick bites and allergy against red meat [30, 31] . The regional distribution of a tick species, the so-called lone-star tick, leads to the development of galactosealpha-1.3-galactose (alpha-GAL) specific IgE antibodies after tick bite. Alpha-GAL is a nearly ubiquitously expressed oligosaccharide of glycoproteins of the cell surface in all non-primate mammalians, prosimians, and new world monkeys. In primates (old world monkeys and humans), about 1 % of the circulating IgG pool correspond to alpha-GAL antibodies, and alpha-GAL is a relevant biological obstacle of a simple xenotransplantation [32] . Since 2014, commercial test systems are available that can be applied to determine specific IgE against alpha-GAL. The exclusion of sensitization to avoid anaphylactic reactions prior to application of humanized antibodies can be life-saving for patients with high-risk profiles. High-risk patients are individuals with many tick bites (e. g., forestry professionals), with cat allergy, and pork-cat syndrome [33] . The determination of alpha-GAL in this high-risk cohort is a showcase of personalized medicine according to the WHO definition: avoiding side effects by specific characterization of patients.",

            "text": "The complexity and size of the molecules, their different expression systems and production processes do not allow real generics of biological products even after expiration of patent protection. Therefore, the concept of biosimilars was developed [36] . Ledford [37] defined biosimilars as an inexact copy of a reference substance. The major question from the immunological point of view is: How similar do biosimilars have to be compared to the original substance, or more bluntly: how similar is similar? The instrumental definition of the EMA considers a biosimilar as highly similar to the original substance in all relevant aspects, i. e., effective mechanism, safety, production process. In the European Union, at least one clinical trial is required from the manufacturers of biosimilars to document the biological equivalence which implicates a relevant switchability of the biosimilar with the originator substance. In addition, extensive immunogenicity data and data on the production process have to be made available. From this regulatory context it is mandatory for the manufacturers to commit themselves to permanent pharmacovigilance and extensive quality management. If the biological equivalence is confirmed, the biosimilar may be introduced onto the market under the INN name. Based on this certified equivalence, the approval authorities can allow an extrapolation, i. e., based on the available data, it is assumed that the biosimilar works also in all other approved indications, equivalently to the originator substance [38, 39] . The switchability and the extrapolation are the aspects that are controversially discussed among Immunologists because the majority of patients with autoimmune diseases receive this medication in addition to other immunomodulatory treatments. Thus, the evaluation of the induction of ADAs and the switchability are particularly complex. On the basis of the data that are currently available for the approval authorities, however, the possibility of switching the approved biosimilars is assumed [38] . Pharmaceutics that are very similar to an originator substance but that do not pass this regulatory process (e. g., in the EU controlled by the EMA, in the USA by the FDA), are called intended copies. Those drugs can be purchased for example in emerging countries but they are not approved in the EU.",

The ciliary function contributes to transporting mucus, possible noxious substances, and particles that have been inhaled in direction of the ostia or the mouth, respectively, whereby pathologies of the ciliary apparatus fundamentally alter the physiology of the airways [53] . The cilia have multiple functions; it could be shown among others that they are chemosensory. At the same time, the intact respiratory epithelium is the basis for functionally intact defense [54, 55] . At transition points to enhanced mechanical use, e. g., in the pharynx, the epithelium merges into a stratified squamous epithelium. In this epithelium, goblet cells are found that produce mucins. These mucins play an elementary role in the unspecific mucosal immunity; they contribute to the barrier function, interact in an antimicrobial way with multiple antimicrobial peptides and defensins [56] , develop a highly flexible and complex mucin-interactome [57] , and act synergistically with inflammatory cytokines, e. g., IL-1\u03b2 [58] . Submucous glands produce nasal lining secretions, these consist of both, a transsudative (vasomotor) and a secretory layer. In the luminal secretory layer, substances with an unspecific antimicrobial activity are found, such as e. g., lysozyme, lactoferrin and defensins as well as adaptive mucosal antibodies of the IgA type (IgA1 and IgA2) [59] and the secretory component, which ensures the biostability of secretory mucosal IgA [60] . In addition, also IgM and IgG are found. IgA is induced by interaction with commensals and external influences and may additionally neutralize exotoxins as well as pathogens and transport sIgA commensals through the epithelium in luminal direction. Mucosal IgA has multiple functions of immune exclusion due to various affinities [61] and thus it contributes relevantly to the mucosal immunity of the respiratory mucosa and determines an active antigen-specific protection at this important external border of the upper airways, which is the most exposed external surface of the human body in relation to the covered surface.",

This involves tissue macrophages, eosinophilic, neutrophilic granulocytes, basophils, and mast cells, that act according to stimuli and pathology. Intraepithelial lymphocytes of the CD4 and CD8 type act in an antigen specific and adaptive manner. Together with submucous lymphocyte infiltrates of the lamina propria and special, functionally adapted NALT regions with adapted M cells and dome areas, \u03b3\u03b4T cells [62] , innate lymphoid cells (ILC) [63] as well as NKT cells may induce tolerogenic, allergic, or cytotoxic immune responses [64, 65] . Furthermore, the pharyngeal tonsil, which usually should involute by school age, is part of the integrated mucosal system in the nasopharynx. Beside T cell infiltrates in e. g., allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, also areas of local IgE production by B cells [66] as well as dendritic cells [67, 68] exist. Together with macrophage-like dendritic CD11 + CD14 + CD68 cells, those professional, antigen presenting, partly immature CD1 + CD11 + cells form a dense network for regulation of adaptive immune responses [69] and express especially in atopics the highly affine IgE receptor Fc\u03b5RI as well as costimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86, and CD40 [70] . There is evidence, that apart from lymphoepithelial areas respiratory epithelium adapts functionally to existing immunological conditions. Hereby, it is modified by inflammatory stimuli such as e. g., IFN\u03b3 or IL-4 in its transcriptome and consecutively functional properties. This leads for example to a defective barrier function due to reduced expression of tight junction proteins [71] . However, the epithelium is acting as an immunointerface in the initiation and maintenance of e. g., allergic inflammation. This involves inflammatory cytokines such as TSLP [72] , IL-25 [73] , or IL-24 [74] and epithelial alarmins such as IL-33, that contribute mucosal inflammation [75] .",

The adjusted relative risk amounted to 3.53 (95 % CI: 2.11-5.91) for allergic rhinitis and -that is also a relevant result -to 2.71 (95 % CI: 1.64-4.46) for non-allergic rhinitis.",

A research team from the UK analyzed a clinical cohort with 57 patients suffering from CRSwNP with regard to pulmonary function, bronchial hyperreactivity, and exhaled nitrogen monoxide (FeNO). In this context, 3 clinical groups with different phenomena could be identified. However, these groups were not different regarding the severity of their nasal symptoms [85] . Not only in cases of allergic asthma, but also in cases of non-allergic asthma and COPD, an association to pathologies of the nose and the paranasal sinuses could be demonstrated. Patients with non-allergic asthma and COPD had a higher symptom burden in the validated SNOT-20 questionnaire as well as increased concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in nasal lining secretions, e. g., IFN\u03b3 and G-CSF, but also eotaxin and MCP-1 [86] .",

On one hand, biofilms play a relevant role [112] , on the other hand, the microbiome in the investigated patient population is probably iatrogenically altered and limited in its diversity in favor of single species. So Abreu et al. revealed a loss of lactic acid bacteria in favor of Corynebacterium tuberculostearium [113] . Choi and colleagues could identify colonization with Staphylococcus aureus [114] . Since especially severe cases of CRS with nasal polyposis are associated with the presence of specific IgE against S. aureus enterotoxin and also the colonization of the mucosa with S. aureus is accompanied with nasal polyposis, tissue eosinophilia, and a Th2 microenvironment [115] , the question of cause and effect has to be asked. Actually, S. aureus IgE is also found in severe adult asthma [116] and the involvement of superantigens in atopic eczema is documented clinically as well as experimentally [117] . Hence it is very difficult to estimate the role of a complex microbiome in these heterogenic cohorts that are often pretreated with antibiotics. Data on the exacerbation by bacterial superinfection in CRS are incomplete. Therapeutic microbiome interventions, e. g., as microbiota transfer may be promising tools in personalized medicine [118] , however, this topic has not been published in rhinology up to now.",

Recent reports define the specific consensus, however, in contrast to allergic rhinitis sound data are not available [138, 139] . In the context of non-allergic chronic rhinitis, several subtypes are defined such as non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia (NARES) [140] , hormonal rhinopathy, rhinitis with neurogenic inflammation [141] (which is possibly a specific endotype, see chapter 2.4), and idiopathic rhinitis (which is still called vasomotor rhinitis in English-speaking countries).

Patients who had allergic rhinitis beside the symptoms of CRS had an additionally increased risk to be affected from asthma (adjusted OR: 11.85; 95 % CI: 10.57-13.17).

Recently, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) performed changes of the definitions, in particular GPA (formerly called Wegener's granulomatosis [149] ) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Churg-Strauss vasculitis) must be mentioned. The diagnostic criteria of GPA of the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the ACR are currently being revised based on the current \"Diagnostic and Classification Criteria in Vasculitis Study\" (DCVAS) [150] . Regarding the treatment of GPA with rituximab, meanwhile a recommendation degree A has been stated [151] . From a mechanistic point of view, also eosinophilic GPA (EGPA) is an interesting target for antibodies that target IL-5 or its receptor as recently investigated in clinical studies [152] (see chapter 4.2 below).",

In the airways, the viscous mucus that can only hardly be mobilized leads to recurrent, opportunistic, and often life-threatening broncho-pulmonary and upper-airway infections. In cases of missing enzyme substitution, the altered function in the gastrointestinal tract results in malnutrition syndromes due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Nearly 2,000 mutations of the CFTR gene are known, so the phenotypes can vary considerably (an overview can be found in [44, 45] ). In at least 25-40 % of all patients, sinonasal polyposis is found [107, 153] . Phenotypically, histological subtypes are observed depending on the sample, with rather neutrophilic or eosinophilic inflammation patterns [154, 155] . Regarding the treatment of CF, new selective therapies with small molecules could be established (see above, chapter 1.8).",

A sound mechanistic understanding, however, is the basis for a targeted, ideally precise and personalized therapy. Hypothesis-driven research in immunology and inflammation of the past 30 years has identified the association of allergic airway diseases with phenotypically predominant eosinophilia to the Th2 diseases mainly on the basis of the also didactically elegant Th1/Th2 model [9, 10] . In nasal polyps this was first shown by Bachert [76] , further intensified investigations revealed cytokine patterns [77] and also the involved T cell clones [161] followed. However, for example in Asian cohorts, distinct IL-17 associated inflammatory pattern were [162] . Interestingly, mucosal inflammatory patterns have revealed a transition to a more \"western\" cytokine profile over time, probably associated with socio-cultural transition [163] . Furthermore, patients were diagnosed with CRSwNP in central China in whom none of the expected or \"classic\" cytokine microenvironments was dominant, i. e., neither Th1 nor Th2 nor Th17 inflammation [164] . Even in special types of CRS, e. g., cystic fibrosis, other inflammatory signatures are found [161, 165] . The presence of different infiltrates correlates with the response to the therapy. So Wen [166] could show that nasal polyposis with predominantly neutrophilic infiltrates does not clinically respond to oral steroid treatment. Mucin-1 expression, however, could be identified as marker for a response to steroids [167] .",

First described by Anderson [168] , this concept was intended to result in a more selective and mechanistically rational therapeutic procedure. Regarding the definition of endotypes, for example genetic, mechanistic, histological, or functional properties are classified in order to define different and mechanistically coherent entities [169] . In a simplified way, Wenzel described endoyptes as a \"molecular phenotype\" [170] .

Finally tissue could be gained with adequate quality and quantity from 173 patients with CRS and 89 controls. Based on a pre-defined biomarker selection, all specimens were characterized and assigned to 10 different groups by hypothesis-free analysis. Inflammatory parameters (MPO, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8), type 2 inflammation markers (IgE, ECP, IL-5, and albumin), in the 3 rd group IL-17, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-22, and additionally in 2 further groups IFN\u03b3, TGF\u03b2 1 , S. aureus enterotoxin IgE were examined in the context of a hierarchic cluster analysis. The resulting 10 clusters were compared to clinical phenotypes and appeared mechanistically and clinically S172 plausible in order to depict coherent subtypes. IL-5 negative groups clinically showed mainly chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis and without asthma whereas the IL-5 positive groups, which also had a high systemic and local IgE level, contained a high percentage of asthma-affected patients. Patients who had particularly high IgE values as well as specific IgE against S. aureus enterotoxin generally suffered from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and nearly all of them from comorbid bronchial asthma. However, unfortunately this trial has one relevant weakness: Even if further clinical data have been assessed, they are not included, i. e., data on standardized symptom scores and/or disease-related quality of life. Ideally, also more than the initially 900 patients could and should have been included in the analysis, however, cautiously 3 axiomatic statements can be made that would have to be verified in real-life clinical data and pivotal clinical trials: 1. The more severe chronic rhinosinusitis affects a patient in Europe, the more mechanistically probable is an eosinophilic inflammation that is associated with a quantitative involvement of IL-5, IgE and IgE against S. aureus enterotoxin, depending on the severity.",

Market research data seem to support these statements [175, 176] . A study encompassing prospective data of a national British audit reports that especially patients who suffered from allergies and asthma underwent surgery particularly late. This may be due to the slow process of symptom adaptation as well as to possibly conservative therapy attitudes. However, the data reveal that patients who underwent surgery at early disease stages have a better symptom control and disease-related quality of life in the context of follow-up examinations after 12 and 60 months [177] .

However, data from phenotyping studies show that the therapy responses are very heterogenic regarding surgical as well as conservative therapy approaches and that some patients do not benefit at all [160] . Based on an algorithm with non-supervised machine learning, Soler and colleagues tried to predictively identify these groups. This was partially successful in a pilot study, but it led to clinical groups that were not attributable by known and intuitively understood features and that ad-ditionally completely lack of an -at least currently known -distinct pathophysiological correlate. Nonetheless, such cohorts have to be evaluated and reproduced in order to prospectively verify a possible usability also in algorithms. In summary of endoscopic and radiological findings with systematic eosinophilia in a cohort of more than 1,700 Japanese patients, a scoring system entitled JESREC (Japanese Epidemiological Survey of Refractory Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis) provided a cut-off value that allows describing a diagnostic criterion for eosinophilic CRSwNP and an increased risk for recurrences [188] . These results should be reproduced on an international level with a modified score, if needed. One weakness of the trial is that it could not be verified to what extent the pretreatment with steroids has an effect on the applicability of these tests because patients who had been pretreated with steroids were excluded from the study.",

Actually, monitoring of this T cell conversion to regulatory populations is extremely difficult and in humans it is only possibly by extensive ex vivo examinations [205, 206] . Antigen-specific monitoring is only performed via flow cytometric analyses with tetramers or ELISpots [207, 208] . Mechanistic studies on specific immunotherapy could show that the induction of regulatory T cells is associated with the secretion of inhibitory cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 1 and IL-10; IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 secreting T cells are reduced [209] [210] [211] [212] . While IL-5 mainly contributes to eosinophilia in allergic inflammation as pro-eosinophilic cytokine, IL-4 and IL-13 induce the production of IgE in B cells and have direct proinflammatory effects on the respiratory epithelium [74] , mucous secretion as well as goblet cell hyperplasia of allergic inflammation of the airways [213] . On this basis, the concept of combined specific immunotherapy with human anti IL-4 antibodies was developed. The antibody VAK694 is a fully human antibody directed against the cytokine IL-4 and was applied in patients in the context of an exploratory, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-arm study. Primary endpoint of the trial was the cutaneous allergen-specific late-stage reaction as antigen-specific surrogate for T cell suppression 12 months after therapy in vivo. Explorative surrogate endpoint was the antigen-specific production of IL-4 in ELISpots in vitro. Furthermore, the T cell populations were characterized by flow cytometry. The study was designed as proof-of-concept trial and not sufficiently powered for detection of symptom differences between the therapy groups in the pollen season. The primary endpoint, tolerance in the cutaneous late phase response compared to standard therapy, i. e., specific immunotherapy alone, was not achieved because standard therapy alone reached a suppression of the allergen-induced late phase response in the skin of more than 90 % although a subeffective dosage of the allergen had been chosen. The proof of concept was achieved in vitro: a sustainable suppression of allergen-specific IL-4 producing cells could be shown 12 months after the end of combined therapy and in comparison to immunotherapy alone as well as placebo. This effect, however, did not translate into the clinical endpoint, the cutaneous late phase reaction [215] . If the combination of anti-IL-4 with specific immunotherapy is pursued, remains unclear because the development of VAK694 was stopped.",

            "text": "The role of IgE in asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis as well as parasite defense was described already very early [216] . In 1970, IgE was found for the first time in tissue homogenates in nasal polyposis [217] , and Whiteside examined it in 1975 [218] regarding local lymphocytes and the correlation with systemic IgE levels and atopy. Already at that time, the question of local IgE production in nasal polyps was addressed which became a relevant research issue in the pathophysiology of CRS. In 2001, Bachert could show that the proportion of IgE in the tissue correlates with local eosinophilic infiltrates [78] . In the early 2000ies, the association with specific IgE against S. aureus enterotoxin [146, 219] was discovered, in particular in severe cases, which was another hint to pathophysiologic involvement of IgE. In 2005, Gevaert could document the local IgE synthesis in the tissue [66] . From here, it was a logic consequence to investigate the therapeutic application of omalizumab in patients with CRSwNP in clinical trials. First case reports and retrospective case series were published by Penn [220] , Guglielmo [221] , and Vennera [222] , mainly in patients who were treated in-label with omalizumab because of their severe asthma. Pinto and colleagues were the first research group that published a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study could reveal no superiority of the verum arm compared to placebo. This was also due to the inclusion criteria because in this study patients with as well as without nasal polyposis were included [223] . A placebo-controlled follow-up trial published by Gevaert in 2013 with application of omalizumab in patients with CRS-wNP and comorbid asthma over a treatment period of 16 weeks, could consistently observe a reduction of the nasal polyp score ( \u2212 2.67; P = 0.001) as well as the nasal symptom score and the disease-related quality of life in comparison to placebo [224] (\u25b6 Fig.  3) . Further studies in the context of this indication have already been completed according to the study registries (NCT01066104), at the time of manuscript submission the results have not been published. Subsequent studies on CRS have been registered as actively recruiting, among others under clinicaltrials.gov.",

Only after about 16 weeks, the pharmaco-dynamic response can be measured adequately in the serum. Pharmaco-dynamic investigations under omalizumab treatment additionally show that the de novo IgE synthesis decreases of about 50 % per year with the treatment with omalizumab [225] . This observation can be explained by a possible change of the IgE homeostasis because of ne-gative feedback mechanisms that involve the low-affine IgE receptor. Thus it is justified to assume a possible timely limitation of therapy and withdrawal trials. For this purpose, long-term data would have to be evaluated in order to define rational therapy corridors.",

The first trial in humans and actual milestone trial of CRS-wNP was published by Gevaert in 2006. In this first double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, a total of 24 patients with bilateral CRSwNP received a single dose of the humanized anti-IL-5 antibody reslizumab or placebo. The effect on systemic eosinophils in the blood and ECP concentrations in the serum could be pharmaco-dynamically measured up to 8 weeks. Only half of the patients treated with the real substance showed a therapeutic effect on the endoscopically revealed polyp scores. In a post-hoc analysis, Gevaert and colleagues could demonstrate that the responders were those patients who had high IL-5 concentrations in nasal secretion at the time of treatment onset. By means of a regression analysis, a cut-off value for IL-5 > 40 pg/ml in nasal lining secretions could be defined that could predict a positive therapy outcome after reslizumab application (odds ratio: 21.0; 95 % CI: 1.5-293.3; P = 0.009). A multicenter study with reslizumab conducted in the USA investigated the effectiveness of poorly controlled eosinophilic bronchial asthma. Interestingly, reslizumab was more effective in the subgroup of asthma patients with known CRSwNP compared to asthma patients without polyposis [226] . This subtyping corresponded quasi to an indirect endotyping. Another trial on CRS with reslizumab has been registered as recruiting at the time of manuscript submission under clinicaltrials.gov.",

It must be discussed if this fact is due to a selection bias of the sample or the biomarker itself. In a post-hoc biomarker trial, Bachert and his research group investigated local and systemic expressions of periostin in different therapy modalities. In this context, it became obvious that the peri-ostin expression reflects the local and systemic eosinophilic load and was reduced in serum and nasal secretion after application of systemic steroids as well as after application of mepolizumab and omalizumab in CRSwNP [244] .

In this way, allergic sensitizations can be more precisely assessed and thus allowing certain predictability with regard to the therapeutic outcome of AIT. Also for diagnosis of anaphylaxis or exclusion of sensitization against alpha-GAL before application of humanized antibodies such as cetuximab, the component-based diagnostics are essential. The EAACI established an application guideline [246] , a more compact version focused on otolaryngology has recently been published also for aeroallergens [247] . 5 . Conclusion and general reflections on personalized medicine \"Personalized medicine\" has become a buzzword even if it has been clearly defined by the WHO. It describes a medical model using molecular profiling technologies for tailoring the right therapeutic strategy for the right person at the right time, and determine the predisposition to disease at the population level and to deliver timely and stratified prevention. Individualized therapy as well as the population-based stratification and prevention play a key role in personalization [248] . The risk to neglect patients by molecular stratification should be taken seriously. We determine endotypes in our algorithms without knowing the complete pathophysiological picture. Avoiding side effects and not treating patients who do not express a certain biomarker or who are characterized as potential non-responders, has nothing in common with individualism and participation in the therapeutic decision-making process and does certainly not reflect the expectations that our patients have with regard to personalized medicine. Hence, this procedure is meanwhile current practice for oncological patients. A molecular determinism possibly puts at risk a well-informed healthcare behavior [249] , however, the application of biomarkers (e. g., for blood type or the identification of allergic sensitization) in stratified therapy belongs to the standard of modern medicine (e. g., blood type compatible products, allergenspecific immunotherapy) [250] .",
