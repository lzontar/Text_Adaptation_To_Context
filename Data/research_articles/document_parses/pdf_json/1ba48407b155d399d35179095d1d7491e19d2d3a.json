Previously we showed a comparable virus tropism and host innate immune responses between H1N1pdm and seasonal H1N1 influenza virus in the human respiratory tract, 3 however H1N1pdm virus differed from seasonal H1N1 influenza virus in its ability to replicate in human conjunctiva, suggesting subtle differences in receptor-binding profile and highlighting the potential role of the conjunctiva as an additional route of infection. We now compare the tropism and host responses elicited by pandemic H1N1 with that of related swine influenza viruses and a pandemic-swine reassortant virus in ex vivo and in vitro cultures of the human respiratory tract and conjunctiva. We have used recombinant virus to investigate the role of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of H1N1pdm virus in its conjunctival tropism. These findings are relevant for understanding transmission and therapy.",

            "text": "A variety of human monolayer and suspension cell cultures have been tested on their capability to support influenza virus replication. Among them, some support influenza A virus growth as well as MDCK cells do, 4 others support replication of a virus, but do not enable the formation of mature viral particles, 5 whereas others show only a weak level of replication or are not permissive at all. 2 CaCo-2 cells, for example, represent a good substitute for MDCK cells, because it has been shown that the rate of viral isolation in CaCo-2 cells is as effective as in MDCK, and sometimes is even better. 6 The success of viral replication is determined not only by the cell culture type, but also by the virus itself. Despite the accepted view that it is the type of receptor that defines the interaction between the virus and the host cell, there is evidence that it is not the only factor that predetermines the fate of the cell. 7 The fate of the infected cell can also differ. A series of articles show that apoptosis is the most probable mechanism of cell killing by influenza viruses. 8, 9 Influenza A viruses of different subtypes induce apoptosis to a different extent (e.g. H3 viruses provoke more strong apoptotic response than H1 viruses do 10 ). Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that CaCo-2 cells do not follow the apoptotic pathway and die through necrosis. 11 The SJPL cell line also dies through necrotic pathway and not apoptosis. 12 The aim of our work was to compare growth characteristics of different flu viruses (e.g. avian, swine, and human) in various human and animal cell cultures and to evaluate their influence on cell culture growth. The parameters measured in the study were as follows: cytopathic changes of cell cultures following virus infection, hemagglutinin production, NP synthesis, the dose-dependent effect of infection on cell proliferation, and the ability of viruses to induce apoptosis.",

The available evidence suggests that each of the 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase (NA) subtype combinations exist in harmony with their natural hosts, cause no overt disease, and are shed predominantly in the feces. 1, 2 In this study we determined the subtypes and prevalence of low-pathogenic influenza A viruses present on the territory of Kazakhstan in 2004-2006 and further analysed the HA and NA genes of these isolates in order to obtain a more detailed knowledge about the genetic variation of influenza A virus in their natural hosts. (Institute for Biological Safety Problems, Gvardeiskiy, Zhambyl Oblast, Kazakhstan)). Samples that were identified as influenza A virus positive by matrix rRT-PCR were thawed, mixed with an equal volume of phosphate buffered saline containing antibiotics (penicillin 2000 U \u2044 ml, streptomycin 2 mg \u2044 ml, and gentamicin 50 lg \u2044 ml), incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature, and centrifuged at 1500 g for 15 minutes. The supernatant (0AE2 ml \u2044 egg) was inoculated into the allantoic cavity of four 9-day old embryonated hens' eggs as described in European Union Council Directive 92 \u2044 40 \u2044 EEC. 3 Embryonic death within the first 24 hour of incubation was considered as non-specific, and these eggs were discarded. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 3 days the allantoic fluid was harvested and tested by haemagglutination (HA) assay as describe in European Union Council Directive 92 \u2044 40 \u2044 EEC. In the cases where no influenza A virus was detected on the initial virus isolation attempt, the allantoic fluid was passaged twice in embryonated hens eggs. The number of virus passages in embryonated eggs was limited to the maximum two to limit laboratory manipulation. A sample was considered negative when the second passage HA test was negative. The subtypes of the virus isolates were determined by conventional haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) test, as describe in European Union Council Directive 92 \u2044 40 \u2044 EEC. 3 RNA extraction and PCR with specific primers RNA was extracted from infective allantoic fluid using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGENE, GmbH, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was converted to full-length cDNA using reverse transcriptase.

Along the western Pacific migratory flyway, the influenza virus gene pool in the domestic waterfowl of southern China has 'mixed' longitudinally with viruses isolated from Japan, Mongolia, and Siberia. However, it appears that there has also been 'mixing' latitudinally through overlapping migratory flyways, thereby facilitating interaction between the influenza virus gene pool in domestic waterfowl in the eastern and western extremities of the Eurasian continent. This helps to explain the latitudinal spread of the Qinghai-like (clade 2AE2) H5N1 virus in the last 2 years, while H5N1 outbreaks in Korea and Japan may represent the longitudinally transmitting pathway. 10 HA of subtype H13 so far has been found exclusively in shorebirds, such as gulls, and in a pilot whale (potentially a spillover from shorebirds), but not in other avian species that are natural hosts of influenza A virus, such as ducks and geese; therefore the study of the evolution of these viruses is very interesting.

Antigenic drift requires vaccines to be updated to correspond with the dominant epidemic strains. In humans, IVs show both antigenic drift frequently. In contrast, IVs from birds are in evolutionary stasis, 1 and they show little amino acid changes. 2, 3 The reason is that IVs in bird intestine are not subjected to strong immune selection.",

Farmraised domestic waterfowl are allowed to feed in and share the same water body with migratory birds, thereby facilitating direct interactions between domestic waterfowl and freeranging migratory birds. This makes Poyang Lake an ideal site to observe the dynamics of influenza virus interactions between migratory and sentinel ducks in southern China.",

Unlike highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses that have been rarely detected in the live-poultry markets in Hong Kong since 2002, H9N2 viruses are still frequently isolated in our surveillance program. Therefore, we try to understand the continuing evolution of H9N2 viruses through genetic characterization and phylogenetic analyses of the viruses isolated in Hong Kong live-poultry markets from 2005 to 2009.",

Further studies are necessary to identify the at-risk season and type of farming systems at risk of swine influenza infection.

Further investigation are needed to precise this typology. The risk of SwIV infection increases with a combination of three major factors. Poultry production does not seem to play any role on swine infection. The generalized linear mixed model afforded to take into account all the non investigated parameters at the herd level. Although we investigated the most common risk factors of swine influenza infection covering different kind of fields, the herd random effect might explain risk variations. Mixed models have become a frequently used tool in epidemiology. Due to software limitations, random effects are often assumed to be normally distributed. Since random effects are not observed, the accuracy of this assumption is difficult to check. 6 Further studies, such as case-control or cohort studies could help to identify more precisely risk factors of swine influenza seropositivity, as these study designs are more adapted than cross-sectional studies.

            "text": "The concept that swine are a mixing-vessel for the reassortment of influenza viruses and for the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses has been re-enforced by the emergence of the recent pandemic. 1 The pandemic H1N1 virus of 2009 (H1N1pdm) is believed to have emerged through the reassortment of North American triple reassortant and Eurasian avian-like swine influenza viruses. 2 Since the immediate precursor of this pandemic virus has not yet been identified, it is not possible to be definite whether the reassortment leading to the pandemic occurred in swine, but swine influenza viruses are the nearest known ancestors of each gene segment of H1N1pdm. 1, 2 The mechanisms of pandemic emergence are not clear. It is believed that the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 arose through reassortment of the pre-existing human seasonal influenza virus with avian influenza viruses, and swine have been proposed to be a possible intermediate host where such reassortment between human and avian viruses may take place. 4 The 2009 pandemic was the first to arise for over 40 years and the first to occur after the understanding that pandemics arise from animal influenza viruses. 3 Systematic studies of influenza virus ecology and evolution in swine are, therefore, important in order to understand the dynamics of pandemic emergence. Furthermore, since swine are the likely host within which H1N1pdm virus originated, it was predicted that this virus would readily infect swine and may reassort with endemic swine influenza viruses. These predictions have now been confirmed with reports of H1N1pdm being detected in pigs in many countries and reassortment with endemic swine influenza virus being confirmed. 5 While H1N1pdm has been genetically and antigenically stable in humans, reassortment between H1N1pdm, which is well adapted to transmission in humans, and other avian or swine viruses may lead to the origin of novel viruses posing a threat to public health. In addition to endemic swine virus lineages, avian influenza viruses such as H9N2 and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 have also been occasionally identified in pigs in parts of Asia. 6, 7 It has been shown that H1N1pdm readily reassorts with H5N1 to generate viable progeny in vitro. 8 It is therefore essential to monitor the ecology, evolution, and biological characteristics of swine influenza viruses so that their continued evolution and zoonotic and pandemic potential can be monitored. There is however, a paucity of surveillance data on swine influenza viruses worldwide. This is in part related to the negative commercial consequences that may arise from detection of influenza in a swine herd leading to a major economic loss to the producer.",

It is suggested that the 1918 pandemic virus was purely derived from avian virus, which adapted to humans and caused efficient human-to-human transmission, 1 while the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 had acquired the viral haemagglutinin, PB1 polymerase, and in 1957, the neuraminidase gene segments from the avian gene pool. 2 The major regional outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in Asia, Europe, and Africa highlight the potential role played by migratory waterfowl in disseminating highly pathogenic influenza viruses. 3 Therefore defining the influenza virus gene-pool in wild birds is of vital importance.",

A total of 192 isolates were obtained from 39 152 specimens collected during the winter period coinciding with the southern migration of waterfowl along the East Asian Flyway and one isolate obtained from 202 samples collected in spring during the period when northern migration of waterfowl took place along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. The isolation in Hong Kong was slightly lower than a similar study conducted in South Korea in which the isolation rate of migratory birds was 0AE8% in 2003-2008. 9 This suggested a slightly lower prevalence of influenza virus present in Hong Kong as the birds migrated southwards. The viruses isolated in Hong Kong, representing hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of H1-H12 and neuramidinase (NA) subtypes of N1-N9, were all from wild waterfowl ( Table 1) . Out of the twelve HA subtypes isolated, H10 and H6 were the two subtypes that were isolated frequently every year for H10 and in six out of seven years for H6, respectively. H10 and H6 viruses accounted for 16AE7% and 22AE4% of all virus isolated, respectively. On the other hand, H3, H9, and H12 were the least prevalence (0AE5%) and were only isolated once in 7 years. Of the NA subtypes, N1 and N2 were isolated most often (24AE4% and 19AE2% of all isolates, respectively) and N5 was the least (0AE5%). November was the month that had the highest prevalence of influenza virus (0AE83% of samples being positive) compared to only 0AE3% in March. The subtype's variation was the most diverse in December during our 7 years of surveillance. This suggested that more of these wild migratory birds may be carrying influenza virus when they arrive in Hong Kong. However the continued isolation of viruses suggests continued circulation of these viruses in the vicinity of Mai Po.",

The result of the phylogenetic analysis correlated with the findings from satellite tracking that viruses isolated in Hong Kong were closely related to those isolated in areas along the migratory route. No healthy bird was isolated with HPAI H5N,1 although dead wild birds have been regularly found to have HPAI H5N1 virus, suggesting that infected birds might not live for a long period. Introduction A novel swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus emerged in Mexico in April 2009 and rapidly spread worldwide, causing the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. 1 Most confirmed human cases of H1N1 \u2044 2009 influenza have been uncomplicated and mild, but the increasing number of cases and affected persons worldwide warrant optimal prevention and treatment measures. Today, almost all of the pandemic H1N1 \u2044 2009 viruses tested are resistant to M2blockers. 2 Therefore, only the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are currently recommended for treatment of this pandemic influenza. For the control of influenza infection, the clinical use of oseltamivir has increased substantially during the 2009 pandemic. To date, the majority of tested clinical isolates have remained susceptible to NA inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, 2 but oseltamivir-resistant variants with H275Y NA mutation (N1 numbering) have been isolated from individuals taking prophylaxis, from immunocompromised patients, and from a few community clusters. 3, 4 In view of the high prevalence of oseltamivirresistant seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses in 2007-2008, the isolation of resistant H1N1 \u2044 2009 viruses without known oseltamivir exposure raised great concern about the transmissibility and fitness of these resistant viruses. Here we studied the transmissibility of a closely matched pair of pandemic H1N1 \u2044 2009 clinical isolates, one oseltamivir-sensitive and one resistant, in both direct contact and respiratory droplets routes among ferrets. Viral fitness was evaluated by co-infecting a ferret with both the oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant viruses. The viruses were also characterized by full genome sequencing, susceptibility to NA inhibitors, and growth in MDCK and MDCK-SIAT1 cells.",

To assess growth kinetics of viruses, confluent MDCK or MDCK SIAT1 cell monolayers were infected with viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 2AE0 PFU \u2044 cell (single-step) or 0AE001 PFU \u2044 cell (multi-step). Supernatants were collected every 2 h or 12 h p.i. for 6 time points. A modified fluorometric assay using the fluorogenic substrate 2\u00a2-(4-methylumbelliferyl)a-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) was used to determine viral NA activity. 6 The drug concentration required to inhibit 50% of the NA enzymatic activity (IC 50 ) was determined by plotting the percent inhibition of NA activity as a function of compound concentration calculated in the GraphPad Prism 4 (La Jolla, CA) software from the inhibitor-response curve. NA enzyme kinetics were determined by measuring NA activity every 60 seconds for 60 minutes under the same conditions as above, when all viruses were standardized to an equivalent dose of 10 6AE0 PFU \u2044 ml. The K m and V max were calculated by fitting the data to the appropriate Michaelis-Menten equations using nonlinear regression in the GraphPad Prism 4 software. Young adult ferrets (4-5 months of age) were obtained from the ferret breeding program at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. All ferrets were seronegative for influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and for influenza B viruses. For transmission studies, the donor ferrets were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with 10 6 TCID 50 virus in 1AE0 ml sterile PBS . After the donor ferrets were confirmed to shed virus on day 2 p.i., each donor was then housed in the same cage with two na\u00efve direct-contact ferrets. Two additional recipient ferrets were placed in an adjacent cage isolated from the donor's cage by a two layers of wire mesh (approximately 5 cm apart) that prevented physical contact but allowed the passage of respiratory droplets. Ferret weight and temperature were recorded daily for 21 days. Nasal washes were collected from donors and recipients on day 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 p.i. by flushing both nostrils with 1AE0 ml PBS, and TCID 50 titers were determined in MDCK cells. Serum samples were collected 3 weeks after virus inoculation, and were tested for seroconvention by HI assay.",

The wild-type A \u2044 DM \u2044 524 \u2044 09 was susceptible to oseltamivir carboxylate (mean IC 50 : 5AE0 nm), but the A \u2044 DM \u2044 528 \u2044 09 carrying the H275Y NA mutation had IC 50 values approximately 200-300 times of the wild-type viruses (mean IC 50 : 972 nm). The IC 50 of zanamivir was comparable for both viruses and were uniformly low (mean IC 50 \u00a3 1AE3 nm). The H275Y NA mutation confers resistance to oseltamivir carboxylate but did not alter susceptibility to zanamivir. To understand the impact of the H275Y mutation on the NA enzymatic properties, NA enzyme kinetics was determined. The NA of the oseltamivir-resistant virus had a slightly higher K m (mean = 55 lm) and lower V max (mean = 101 U \u2044 sec) than NA of the sensitive virus (K m , mean = 80 lm; Vmax, mean = 86 U \u2044 sec). The results suggested that the H275Y NA mutation reduced NA affinity for substrate and NA catalytic activity, although the function of NA was not severely impaired. To further evaluate the impact of the H275Y NA mutation on virus growth in vitro, single-and multi-cycle growth studies of both viruses were performed in MDCK and MDCK-SIAT1 cells. In the both single-and multiple-cycle growth curves, the two viruses reached comparable levels eventually, but the initial growth of the resistant virus was significantly delayed by at least 1-2 logs in comparison to that of wild-type virus (P < 0AE05).",

We suggest that the lower fitness of resistant virus within the host along with its reduced NA function and delayed growth in vitro may in part explain its less efficient transmission. Notably, the H275Y mutant of H1N1 \u2044 2009 used in this study was the first oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 \u2044 2009 isolate from a patient on oseltamivir prophylaxis to be characterized for transmissibility. Our observation in the animal model is consistent with the epidemiological data collected from humans, which showed no evidence of predominant or continued circulation of oseltamivir-resistant viruses. 4 As this study was undertaken, additional H275Y mutants of H1N1 \u2044 2009 viruses have emerged in the absence of oseltamivir use. 7, 8 The emergence of these viruses should raise concerns as to whether resistant H1N1 \u2044 2009 viruses will acquire greater fitness and spread worldwide as the naturally resistant H1N1 viruses did during the 2007-2008 season. Two independent studies have evaluated the pathogenecity and transmission of other oseltamivir-resistant pandemic H1N1 \u2044 2009 clinical isolates in the animal models. 9, 10 One of the studies, 9 which also used an oseltamivir-resistant virus isolated from a patient under oseltamivir prophylaxis, observed similar results as ours: although the respiratory-droplet route of transmission was not investigated, it was shown that the resistant isolate was transmitted though direct-contact route and was as virulent as wild-type virus in ferrets. 9 In another study, 10 two oseltamivir-resistant isolates were transmitted through the respiratory-droplet route in ferrets, and the dynamics of transmission were different between the two isolates. Apparently, these two oseltamivir-resistant isolates were still unequal in their transmissibility and were disparate from the resistant isolate in our study. The isolation history of the two resistant isolates was unclear in this study, and this would be an important factor to understand the fitness of drug-resistant viruses. Further studies with more clinical isolates of diverse isolation background are warranted to identify how these novel H275Y mutants of pandemic H1N1 \u2044 2009 virus have changed to retain their full transmissibility. Taken together, all these related studies underline the necessity of continuous monitoring of drug resistance and characterization of potential evolving viral proteins.",

Only after its initial emergence in humans has this virus been repeatedly detected in pigs, and found to further reassort with other swine influenza virus.

Postmortem examination on 4 and 7 dpi revealed that pigs infected with HK915 had the most extensive gross lesions in the lungs, and histochemical staining of viral nucleoprotein (NP) in lung tissues on 4 dpi also suggested the best replication for HK915 in the lower respiratory tract. On 11 days post-contact (dpc), all pigs exposed to the inoculated animals developed sero-conversions (HI = 80-160) except for one from the GD106 contact group. However, on 17 dpc, its HI titer reached 40, indicating slower seroconversion.",

They could also transmit efficiently between pigs. When compared with the pandemic stains and its reassortant progeny (HK201), the HK915 (H1N2) virus containing the EA-like M gene in the genetic context of the TRIG virus showed consistently higher virulence in all three mammalian models tested, but it is still unknown what might happen if such a virus further reassorts to obtain the pandemic-like or EA-like NA gene. However, our findings suggest that pigs could likely maintain the prevalence of different genotypes of pandemic-related influenza viruses, and highlight the zoonotic potential of multiple strains of swine influenza virus.",

These results suggest that the unique gene combination seen with the pandemic H1N1 viruses may confer its transmissibility among humans.",

Particular risk factors for H5N1 infection include bathing with sick birds, improper hand washing after handling sick birds, or slaughtering poultry. 5 Viral inoculum may also be consumed directly during a variety of religious and cultural practices, such as drinking contaminated duck blood and kissing of merit release birds. H5N1 infection is lethal in 60% of human cases, and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to this level of mortality are unclear. To date 505 cases have been reported to the WHO, although many more people have potentially been exposed to H5N1 through contact with infected bird populations. 6 Some studies have suggested that genetic factors may predispose an individual to severe H5N1 disease, 7 but little is known about the influence of route of virus exposure on morbidity and mortality.

The improved survival rates that were observed after an oral infection could be a consequence of low-level viral replication in the upper respiratory tract in combination with delivery of a substantial portion of the inoculum directly to the stomach where it may have been inactivated by the harsh environment of the gastro-intestinal tract. 11 Most ferrets infected orally developed an H5-specific antibody response which differs from the studies of Swayne et al. 6 in which ferrets gavaged with a liquid inoculum neither developed signs of disease nor an antibody response. However Swayne et al. administered virus to anaesthetized ferrets by gastric gavage that would have bypassed the oropharynx. In our study virus was administered to the oral cavity directly and would have had access to the oropharynx. Low level of replication at this site may have been sufficient to trigger an antibody response. The two ferrets that developed severe disease following oral infection had a similar profile of viral dissemination as ferrets infected by the TRT route. Differences were seen in the olfactory epithelium and bulb as lesions, and viral antigen did not occur in these sites following oral infection, although cerebral involvement was identified. One route of dissemination of H5N1 into the CNS may be by transport within nerves through the olfactory bulb into the cerebrum. 12 Due to the absence of lesions and antigen in these sites following oral infection the spread of virus into the brain in these two animals may be occurring through involvement of other cranial nerves or the hematagenous routes.

While the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are currently our first treatment option, the possibility of the emergence of virulent and transmissible drug-resistant H5N1 variants has important implications. Clinically derived drug-resistant viruses have carried mutations that are NA subtype-specific and differ with the NA inhibitor used. 1 The most commonly observed mutations are H274Y and N294S in the influenza A N1 NA subtype (N2 numbering here and throughout the text); E119A \u2044 G \u2044 D \u2044 V and R292K in the N2 NA subtype; and R152K and D198N in influenza B viruses. 2 H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from untreated patients are susceptible to the NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, 3 although oseltamivir-resistant variants with the H274Y NA mutation have been reported in five patients after 4,5 or before 6 drug treatment; and the isolation of two oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 viruses with N294S NA mutation from an Egyptian girl and her uncle after oseltamivir treatment were described. 6 The impact of drug resistance would depend on the fitness (i.e., infectivity in vitro, virulence, and transmissibility in vivo) of the drug-resistant virus. If the resistance mutation only modestly reduces the virus' biological fitness and does not impair its replication efficiency and transmissibility, the effectiveness of antiviral treatment can be significantly impaired.",

Susceptibility to NA inhibitors was tested by using a fluorescence-based NA enzyme inhibition assay with MUNANA substrate at a final concentration of 100 lm. Viral fitness was studied in vivo in a ferret model: groups of three ferrets were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with VN-WT, VN-H274Y, or mixtures of the two at a different ratios at a dose of 10 2 PFU in 0AE5 ml PBS; they were inoculated with TK-WT, TK-H274Y, or mixtures of the two at a different ratios at a dose of 10 6 PFU in 0AE5 ml PBS. Respiratory signs (labored breezing, sneezing, wheezing, and nasal discharge), neurologic signs (hind-limb paresis, ataxia, torticollis, and tremor), relative inactivity index, weight, and body temperature were recorded daily. Virus replication in the upper respiratory tract (URT) was determined on days 2, 4, and 6 p.i. The competitive fitness (i.e., co-inoculation of ferrets with different ratios of oseltamivir-resistant and -sensitive H5N1 viruses) was evaluated by the proportion of clones in day-6 nasal washes that contained the H274Y NA mutation. NA mutations were analyzed by sequence analysis of individual clones ($20 clones \u2044 sample) created by ligation of purified PCR products extracted from nasal wash samples into a TOPO vector.",

In our study we focused on additional NA mutations, and sequence analysis of individual NA clones 7 was done to identify potential host-dependent and compensatory NA mutations. We found that the NA mutations E119A and N294S, which confer cross-resistance to oseltamivir and zanamivir, 1,2 can emerge spontaneously in clade 2.2 H5N1 influenza virus in ferrets. Further, we observed that mutations at NA catalytic (R292K) and framework (I222L and N294S) sites and in close proximity to the NA enzyme active site (V116I, I117T \u2044 V, Q136H, K150N, A250T) emerged without drug pressure in both pairs of H5N1 viruses. Compensatory mutations in NA or other genes may mitigate any fitness cost imposed by resistance mutations. Our study identified six potential compensatory NA changes (D103V, F132S, I254V, E276A, H296L, and F466S) that may affect the fitness of viruses with the H274Y NA mutation. We suggest that NA mutations at residues I254V and E276A are of importance. Interestingly, we observed differences in predominance of I254V and E276A NA mutations in different genetic backgrounds: I254V mutation was identified in A \u2044 Vietnam \u2044 1203 \u2044 04 (H5N1)-like and E276A in A \u2044 Turkey \u2044 15 \u2044 06 (H5N1)-like genetic background. Moreover, I254V NA mutation was identified only when ferrets were inoculated with the mixtures of VN-WT and VN-H274Y viruses, but not in ferrets inoculated with VN-H274Y virus. None of the potential compensatory NA mutations was identified in the original inoculum used to infect ferrets. The H274Y NA mutation causes a large shift in the position of the side chain of the neighboring E276 residue, 8 which must form a salt bridge with R224 to accommodate the large hydrophobic pentyl ether group of oseltamivir. Residue I254 is located near the NA active site, and although it does not alter polarity, it results in a shorter side-chain and, thus, may indirectly affect the residues in the NA active site.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] We discovered a single intranasal administration of laninamivir octanoate (CS-8958), a prodrug of laninamivir, showed a superior anti-virus efficacy in mouse and ferret infection models compared to repeated administra-tion of oseltamivir and zanamivir. [2] [3] [4] 7 This suggested that CS-8958 works as a novel long-acting NA inhibitor of influenza virus in vivo. A single inhalation of CS-8958 proved noninferiority in adult patients 8 and significantly superior in child patients, 9 compared to an approved dosage regimen of oseltamivir for treatment. CS-8958 has been commercially available as an inhaled drug, Inavir \u00d2 , for the treatment of influenza in Japan since October 2010. The long-acting characteristics of CS-8958 are explained by several reasons. First, CS-8958 was quickly hydrolyzed to an active metabolite, laninamivir, after an intranasal administration to mice, and was retained for a long time as laninamivir in target organs, such as lung and trachea. 10 However, with an intranasal administration of laninamivir, it disappeared quickly and did not demonstrate its longlasting characteristics. 10 Another reason is a strong binding of laninamivir to NAs of seasonal influenza viruses compared to other three NA inhibitors, oseltamivir carboxylate, zanamivir, and peramivir. 3 In the following, the tight-binding ability of laninamivir to pandemic (H1N1)2009 NA, as well as to the seasonal influenza virus NAs, was demonstrated. In addition, we present a hypothesis of the mechanism of the long-lasting property of CS-8958 in mouse based on a localization of an enzyme that hydrolyzes CS-8958 to laninamivir.",

Is laninamivir indeed trapped inside ER \u2044 Golgi, and does it make a complex with NA in mice? We are now making an attempt to clarify these concerns. In our study, we have explored the antiviral potential of two newly synthesized compounds to provide protection against the novel pandemic influenza virus H1N1 (2009) strain. The compounds were reconstituted in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), and so the initial studies began with cytotoxicity determination of solvent on uninfected and untreated madin-darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. On obtaining an upper limit for DMSO, the compounds were tested for estimation of their maximum non-toxic dose to the MDCK cells. Thereafter, the effective dose of the compounds was evaluated and validated by a number of assays and gene expression profiling at both nucleic acid and protein level. We found that these newly synthesized compounds possess potent inhibitory activity towards the novel pandemic influenza H1N1 (2009) virus. These findings are being evaluated in vivo for a better understanding of their inhibitory capabilities and also their effect on the host metabolism. This will be required in the course of development of new drugs for use in the prophylaxis and treatment against the influenza virus.",

We have already shown inhibition of influenza virus replication in our earlier studies using catalytic nucleic acids, 11 which can be used as an approach in the development of new therapeutic strategy. These therapies are very useful as the influenza virus vaccines need annual renewals due to frequent genetic drifts in the viral surface proteins. In pandemic situations the existing vaccines do not provide complete protection against the novel virus as the population generally remains na\u00efve for the newly mutated surface antigens. The antiviral drugs play an important role in the control of novel viral strains for which there are no vaccines available. However, the key obstruction in the extensive use of antiviral drugs is their cost and relative therapeutic efficacy provided. Two classes of drugs were being used for treatment and control of the influenza virus infection in humans, the M2 ionchannel blockers 12, 13 (amantadine and rimantadine), which prevent viral uncoating, and the neuraminidase inhibitors 14, 15 (zanamivir and oseltmivir), which prevent the release of influenza virions from the cytoplasmic membrane. But widespread resistance to these antiviral drugs 16, 17 has limited their use. Thus, novel drugs are required for the effective therapy against the emerging strains of influenza virus.",

In this study, outliers with elevated IC 50 values for oseltamivir among seasonal influenza A (H1N1) and H1N1pdm viruses were confirmed to be oseltamivir-resistant based on the presence of the H275Y mutation in the NA. Outliers for oseltamivir and \u2044 or zanamivir among influenza A (H3N2) viruses in this study were shown to harbor mutations at D151, which were earlier associated with reduced susceptibility to zanamivir, 9 and were cell-culture derived. 20 The effects of D151 mutations on NAI susceptibility appear to be strain-specific; however, there are no conclusive supporting data and further investigations are required.",

While the continued circulation or co-circulation of seasonal A (H1N1) viruses is uncertain, the emergence of dual resistant influenza viruses in five countries does present a public health concern, especially since dual resistant viruses would limit the options for antiviral treatment to a single licensed antiviral drug: zanamivir. Moreover, the markers of resistance seen in seasonal A (H1N1) viruses also confer resistance in the more widely circulating 2009 pandemic A (H1N1) virus. And, since the acquisition of mutations in influenza A viruses typically occur through drug selection, spontaneous mutation, or genetic reassortment with another drug resistant influenza A viruses, the detection of influenza A (H1N1) viruses that are resistant to both adamantanes and oseltamivir warrants close monitoring, even if only detected at low frequency. New antiviral agents and strategies for antiviral therapy are likely to be necessary in the future. 1 heightening concern that drug resistance will likewise become prominent in pandemic viral strains and highlighting the need for antiviral drug resistance surveillance. The H275Y mutation in H1N1 neuraminidase is the most common mutation conferring resistance. However, due to the high mutation rates of viruses, new mutations can be expected that will also render viral neuraminidase less sensitive to antiviral drugs. PCR methods can be used to detect previously identified mutations; however, functional neuraminidase enzyme activity inhibition testing is necessary for detecting drug resistance that results from novel mutations. The two neuraminidase enzyme inhibition assays using either the fluorescent MUNANA or chemiluminescent NA-Star \u00d2 substrate are robust tools for NI susceptibility testing. The MUNAN-A-based assay is broadly used by many groups, including many regional health organizations for NI susceptibility testing, yet no standardized protocol or dedicated kit has been in place for this assay, making comparison of data generated between different laboratories difficult. Borrowing from multiple Neuraminidase Inhibitor Susceptibility Network (NISN)-published MUNANA-based neuraminidase assay protocols, 2 we have developed a kit-based fluorescent neuraminidase assay that offers both standardization and off-the-shelf quality-controlled reagents for NI susceptibility testing and other neuraminidase assay applications.

The HA sequences of six independently isolated H5-VHHm escape viruses revealed substitution of a lysine by a glutamic acid residue at position 189 in HA1 (H5 numbering). In addition, two H5-VHHm escape mutants carried an N154D and four carried an N154S substitution. The three-dimensional structure of NIBRG-14 HA shows that N154D \u2044 S and K189E are close to each other as part of the corresponding antigenic site B in H3 HA. 4, 5 Interestingly, the N154D \u2044 S mutations remove an N-glycosylation site, which is surmised to have evolved in H5N1 HA as a strategy to mask an antigenic site. 6 Escape viruses selected in the presence of H5-VHHb carried K189N (n = 4) or K189E (n = 2) substitutions. These results indicate that residues in antigenic site B, at the top of HA and very close to the receptor binding domain (RBD), are essential for neutralization of the virus by H5-VHHm \u2044 b Nanobodies \u00d2 (Figure 2 ).

Nevertheless, this virus induces severe morbidity and lethality in mice.

Of note, all selected escape mutants contained a glutamic acid or serine residue at position 189, which suggests that the conserved positively charged amino acid is important for neutralization by H5-VHH Nanobodies \u00d2 . Interestingly, escape mutants selected with H5-VHHm also carried an N154D \u2044 S co-mutation that removes an N-glycosylation site in this antigenic site of HA. The predicted N-glycosylation site at N154 in A \u2044 Hong Kong \u2044 156 \u2044 97 HA was shown to be glycosylated and may have evolved to mask an antigenic site near the RBD. 7, 8 The selected amino acid changes are located near the receptor binding site of HA.

In addition, novel amino acid change (I to M) at position 117 in the NA gene, which might influence oseltamivir susceptibility, was detected in sequential specimens of a patient. These data showed that generation of oseltamivir resistance could be associated with oseltamivir treatment. Therefore, it needs to strengthen the antiviral monitoring by supplementation of the clinical data including antiviral treatment. During the pandemic, oral oseltamivir was the primary antiviral medication used for treatment of hospitalized patients with pH1N1 infection. Many physicians worried that clinical deterioration or failure to respond to treatment with oseltamivir was due to either oseltamivir resistance or oseltamivir failure. In the United States, two investigational intravenous (IV) NAIs were available during 2009-2010: peramivir through Emergency Use Authorization and zanamivir by Investigational New Drug application. Peramivir would be an option for patients with oseltamivir failure, but would not be appropriate for patients infected with H275Y oseltamivir resistant mutants. IV zanamivir was available in limited supply, but would be appropriate for severely ill patients infected with an oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 virus. During the pandemic, clinicians had few options for antiviral resistance testing in the United States. To respond to this need, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offered antiviral resistance testing for patients suspected to have clinical failure due to oseltamivir resistance. We describe the methods that CDC used to prioritize patients for testing during the pandemic and to detect markers for oseltamivir resistance, as well as the results from this testing.",

Patients that were critically ill [intensive care unit (ICU) admission] or patients with severe immunocompromising conditions with clinical evidence for oseltamivir treatment failure (persistent detection of virus and clinical unresponsiveness to the drug) were prioritized.

Like the NA-Star \u00d2 Influenza Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, the NA-XTD TM Influenza Neuraminidase Assay provides highly sensitive detection of influenza neuraminidase activity. In addition, the NA-XTD TM assay provides extended-glow light emission that eliminates the need for reagent injection and enables signal measurement either immediately or up to several hours after assay completion. The NA-XTD TM assay is also used to quantitate influenza NA activity directly in cellbased virus cultures to monitor viral growth or inhibition. Global monitoring of influenza strains for resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) is essential for understanding their efficacy for seasonal, pandemic, or avian influenza, and studying the epidemiology of viral strains and resistance mutations. Functional neuraminidase inhibition assays enable detection of any resistance mutation, making them extremely important for global monitoring of virus sensitivity to NIs. The first-generation chemiluminescent NA-Star \u00d2 Influenza Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit has been widely used for virus NI sensitivity assays, 1-8 including identification of A \u2044 H1N1 pandemic virus resistant to oseltamivir. 9, 10 In addition, this assay has been used for identification of new NI compounds, 11 NI characterization, 12 studies of virus transmission, 13 drug delivery, 14 NA quantitation of virus-like particles, 15 and cell-based virus quantitation. 16 Neuraminidase assays performed with chemiluminescent 1,2-dioxetane substrates, including NA-Star \u00d2 and NA-XTD TM substrates, typically provide 5-to-50-fold higher sensitivity by signal-to-noise ratio than assays performed with the fluorescent MUNANA substrate. In addition, chemiluminescent assays provide linear results over 3-4 order of magnitude of neuraminidase concentration compared to 2-3 orders of magnitude with the fluorescent assay. 2 The high assay sensitivity achieved with chemiluminescent assays enables use of lower concentrations of viral stocks, and the wide assay range minimizes the need to pre-titer virus stocks prior to IC 50 determination.

The NA-XTD TM substrate is a 1,2-dioxetane structure bearing a sialic acid cleavable group. To perform the NA-XTD assay, virus dilutions (from cell culture supernatant) are pre-incubated in the presence of neuraminidase inhibitor. Then NA-XTD Substrate is added and incubated for 30 minutes for substrate cleavage to proceed. Finally, light emission is triggered upon addition of NA-XTD Accelerator, which provides a pH shift and a proprietary polymeric enhancer, both required for efficient light emission. Chemiluminescent assays are performed in solid white microplates, and light emission is measured in a luminometer. The NA-XTD TM substrate has a single structural difference from the NA-Star \u00d2 substrate that provides a much longer-lasting chemiluminescent signal, with a signal half-life of approximately 2 hours (not shown), compared to $10 minutes with the NA-Star assay, eliminating the need for luminometer instruments equipped with reagent injectors and enabling more convenient batch-mode processing of assay plates.

IC 50 values are unaffected by the addition of Triton X-100 to the virus stock prior to virus dilution (not shown), so the assay is compatible with known virus inactivation reagents. Assay sensitivity and IC 50 values determined with the NA-XTD assay have been compared to those obtained with both the chemiluminescent NA-Star assay and the fluorescent NA-Fluor assay (not shown). The chemiluminescent assays provide 2-to 50-fold higher sensitivity by signal-to-noise ratio, depending on the virus strain, wider assay dynamic range, and better low-end detection limit than the fluorescent assay. The wide assay range with the chemiluminescent assays enables determination of IC 50 values over a range of virus concentrations, eliminating the need to titer virus prior to performing IC 50 determination assays. IC 50 values obtained with the NA-XTD assay are nearly identical to those obtained with the NA-Star assay, with both oseltamivir and zanamivir neuraminidase inhibitors, and tend to be slightly lower than IC 50 values obtained with the fluorescent assay.",

Previous reports of bacterial infection rates of 4-15% with seasonal influenza are difficult to compare with recent studies of pandemic influenza, because the latter tended to focus on more severely ill patients. [20] [21] [22] Bacterial pneumonia has been suspected or diagnosed in 13-24% of patients in intensive care associated with 2009 H1N1 infection and up to 38% of patients who died. 23, 24 Despite aggressive pursuit of specimens for bacterial testing, diagnoses could be confirmed in only 8 (15AE6%) of patients using conventional methodology. Given the difficulty in establishing a diagnosis of bacterial infection, elevated ProCT values may be helpful to identify patients at high risk for invasive disease. In a study of 25 patients with severe 2009 H1N1 or bacterial infection necessitating intensive care, a threshold ProCT level of 0AE8 ng \u2044 ml, demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 62% specificity for bacterial infection. 25 Among 38 patients with 2009 H1N1 associated pneumonia, many of whom had respiratory failure, a threshold ProCT value of 0AE5 ng \u2044 ml provided a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 53% for bacterial infection. 26 Access to samples from lower airways in ventilated patients in these studies may have improved recovery of bacteria and account for the different results we observed. It should be noted that none of our patients were bacteremic, which is a very strong stimulus for ProCT release. ProCT levels have been used successfully to guide therapy in community acquired pneumonia, and our data showing high ProCT levels in patients with infiltrates on CXR suggests ProCT may be most useful for excluding invasive disease. 27, 28 Elevated ProCT levels were not observed in patients with purulent sputum and clear CXR. It is notable that a ProCT level of <0AE25 ng \u2044 ml did not exclude patients with bacterial bronchitis since ProCT has been used to guide antibiotic therapy in COPD exacerbations. 29 While it could be argued that healthy patients with bacterial bronchitis do not require antibiotic treatment, physician behavior in our study indicates antibiotics are frequently prescribed.",

Large hospitals reported that patients with an H1N1 \u2044 09 infection had to be treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Not only does the primary care physician have to be aware of the pathophysiology involved, but also the necessary diagnostic and therapeutic options have to be made available to him. The result will lead to a saving of both lives and healthcare costs. This applies both in epidemic as well as in pandemic times. Today we know that influenza leaves behind a defenceless immune system, and that the proteases of S. aureus contribute to influenza associated pneumonia. Mark von Itzstein, who discovered neuraminidase inhibitors, emphasized the synergistic cooperation of viruses and bacteria (personal communication, 2009). MRSA and influenza viruses are posing problems worldwide. The case of a 17-year-old boy with H1N1 \u2044 09 infection demonstrates how fatal developments can be prevented. Due to his constantly recurring colds, we had already detected the MRSA colonization years earlier and had always worked on boosting his general health and resistance. Both the patient and his family were included in dealing with the problem. The patient was, and is, always vaccinated early with a virosomal vaccine (Baxter). During the Oktoberfest in Munich in September 2009, when H1N1 infections were increasingly occurring, we learned that our patient had come down with an extremely acute feverish illness. With the help of the rapid test, we diagnosed an H1N1 \u2044 09 virus infection and started treatment with oseltamivir immediately. The humoral inflammation status, which had increased very rapidly to more than 4AE5 mg \u2044 dl within hours, was treated with the effective cotrimoxazol from the antibiogram. At the same time, the patient was heparinized. The following day the patient had no fever and was symptom-free. It was only through our early knowledge of what could develop pathophysiologically that we were in a position to make the right decision at the right time.",

The decisive factor, however, is the constant clinical alertness towards the course of every acute feverish cold with acute onset. The patient has to remain in the care of the attending physician, and the chosen treatment has to be administered and monitored. This means constant SpO2 measurements and checking the humoral inflammation status every 2 hours. If a clinical worsening occurs during monitoring, the treatment regime has to be changed immediately, which means the administration of an appropriate antibiotic. This outpatient care on the part of the doctor has to be available 7 days a week so that no time will be lost. Reports from The Netherlands and Denmark show that, with the help of this preventive strategy under the motto 'search and destroy,' the dangerous, fatal course of infections reported in Germany with at least four deaths a day, can be avoided. However, the doctor has to be adequately remunerated for the elaborate amount of time this intensive outpatient care requires. With our strategy, we have moved from divergence to convergence in the care of our patients. We reported on our 10 years of clinical experience with this approach at the Antivirals Congress in Peking. Our main message was early diagnosis and early treatment. We were able to demonstrate this in 287 outpatients with seasonal influenza and 25 H1N1 \u2044 09 outpatients.

Three positive (dark gray bars) and two negative controls (light gray bars) were included in the same microplate. All serum samples corresponding to convalescent subjects exhibited absorbance values 1AE75-4AE5 times higher than negative samples ( Figure 1 ). Normalized absorbance values above 1AE5 suggested exposure to the virus, although, a more conservative threshold value of 1AE75 units is proposed for discrimination between exposed and non-exposed subjects. The ELISA method described here yields adequate reproducibility and a high signal \u2044 noise ratio within determinations in the same microplate and among different microplates. Using a normalized absorbance value of 1AE75, the method was able to discriminate samples from convalescent patients, preferably after the third week of infection, and at least up to the twentyfourth week of exposure.",

            "text": "In April 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza virus emerged in North America and caused the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. [1] [2] [3] [4] The 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) has a unique gene constellation that was not previously identified in any species or elsewhere. It is genetically related to the triple reassortant swine H1N1 influenza viruses currently circulating in North America, with the exception of the neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) genes, which are derived from a Eurasian swine influenza virus. Swine H1N1 influenza viruses were first isolated in 1930 and continued to circulate in North America with very little antigenic changes (classical swine H1N1) until 1998. Since 1999, however, the antigenic make up of swine H1 viruses has shown increased diversity due to multiple reassortment events and the introduction of H1N1 genes from human influenza viruses. Currently, four swine H1 clusters (a, b, c, d) are found endemic in the North American swine population. 5, 6 These swine H1 viruses show substantial antigenic drift compared to the classical swine H1 viruses. Cluster d swine H1 is derived from current human H1 viruses, and there is a substantial antigenic divergence between classical swine H1 and human seasonal H1 viruses. Epidemiological evidence shows a two-way transmission of influenza viruses between swine and humans, and such events lead to the emergence of the pdmH1N1 virus. 5, 7, 8 Phylogenetic analysis have suggested that possible ancestors of the eight genes of pdmH1N1 were circulating in the swine population for at least 10 years prior to the emergence of the pdmH1N1 virus in humans, although the pdmH1N1 virus itself was not isolated from pigs until after the pandemic. Interestingly, pdmH1N1 infections have been reported not only in humans and pigs, but also in other animal species such as turkeys, cats, ferrets, cheetahs, and dogs. [9] [10] [11] After the first report of pdmH1N1 infection in swine in Canada, other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Singapore, Northern Ireland, Finland, Iceland, England, United States, Japan, and China reported outbreaks of pdmH1N1 in swine as well. 9, [12] [13] [14] The ample geographic range of pdmH1N1 outbreaks in swine, its apparent broad host range, and the possibility of two-way transmission between swine and humans poses a tremendous challenge for controlling the virus. Therefore, to differentiate pdmH1N1 from other H1 strains, particularly in swine and human populations, is an important issue to ascertain the magnitude of the disease caused by the pdmH1N1. In this study, we developed an ELISA assay to discriminate pdmH1N1 strains from other swine and human H1 viruses.",

In this study, we described a convenient sandwich ELISA based on three mAbs developed against the pdmH1N1 strain. The ELISA not only shows high specificity for pdmH1N1 strain, but also shows great sensitivity. The ELISA could distinguish pdmH1N1 strains from human seasonal H1 and H3 viruses and, more importantly, from other swine H1 viruses. We must note that current rapid diagnostic tests cannot be used to differentiate pdmH1N1 from swine or human H1 viruses. 28 It is also worth noting that the sensitivity of commercial rapid antigen-based diagnostic tests for detecting pdmH1N1 is lower than that for human seasonal influenza viruses. 28, 29 A study by Kok et al. 32 showed that sensitivity of the current rapid antigenic tests for pdmH1N1 is only 53AE4%, whereas that for seasonal influenza A is 74AE2%. Chen et al. 33 developed a dot-ELISA and increased the sensitivity for influenza rapid antigen detection. However, the dot-ELISA developed by Chen cannot distinguish among subtypes. The LOD of our ELISA is between 3AE2 \u00b7 10 3 to 1AE5 \u00b7 10 4 TCID50 \u2044 ml, comparable to the LOD of rapid diagnostic tests for human seasonal influenza viruses. 21 Compared to the ''gold standard''-virus isolation-our sandwich ELISA showed 90AE1% sensitivity using ferret nasal washes.

Optimal design is increasingly used to conceive studies 5 and provides cost-efficient designs. Here we propose an optimised design to model VK in the case of influenza infection. We defined the number of participants, the number of samples to collect and their allocations. This design allows, at a minimum cost and discomfort, accurate VK curves and allows the natural history parameters to be well described.",

With the hypothesis that the inoculation occurred at 8:00 am, we chose three possible hours (8:00, 14:00, and 20:00) for each day with respect of the sleep-time. 8 To validate the design, we simulated 100 datasets of 44 volunteers with the optimised design obtained.

The parameter describing the effect of the early immune response on the virus production rate was, however, less precisely estimated (predicted RSE = 62%), and the initial value of the viral titre was very different of the one obtained with the original dataset (bias V init on Figure 2 ). This is probably due to the fact that it was measured at day 2 post inoculation, and that the inter-individual variability is much higher than at day 0.

Usefulness of a self-blown nasal discharge specimen for use with immunochromatography based influenza rapid antigen test Introduction Influenza rapid antigen tests (IRAT) have become very popular and are widely used for confirming suspected clinical diagnosis of influenza in Japan. 1 Most of the currently used IRAT that are based on immunochromatography (IC), nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspiration, and throat swab have been approved as specimens for Japanese national health insurance purposes. But the specimen collection by these methods gives patients considerable discomfort, and sometimes appropriate specimens cannot be obtained due to patient resistance, especially by children. In the present studies, self-blown nasal discharge was used as the specimen for an IRAT, and the results were compared with the results of viral isolation and an identical kit primed with nasopharyngeal swab specimens for seasonal influenza viruses and pandemic (H1N1)2009 virus.",

There were no statistically significant differences between the IC kit results primed with self-blown discharge and nasopharyngeal swab specimens for influenza A, influenza B and Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. and nasal swab specimens, suggesting that the self-blown specimens contained sufficient viral antigen for the IC kits. The influence of the presence or absence of nasal congestion on the results of the kit was assessed. The sensitivity of selfblown specimens from patients with nasal congestion was significantly lower than that from patients without nasal congestion. It is possible that insufficient capability to blow the nose due to nasal congestion might tend to lead to false negatives. The observation that the time to positive is longer for patients with nasal congestion than for patients without nasal congestion is concordant. Application of self-blown specimen collection only to appropriate patients would increase the sensitivity, which would be important in a clinical setting. We tested only two commercial antigen detection kit, the Quick Vue Rapid SP influ kit and Quicknavi\u00d4-Flu (Denka-seiken Co., Ltd). The resulting sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the IC kit primed with self-blown specimens were considered adequate for clinical use. To confirm the usefulness of self-blown nasal discharge specimens, further investigation is necessary using other kits and in different settings.",

Most commercial rapid antigen tests (RAT) can detect influenza A or B viruses, but cannot specifically distinguish pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus with seasonal influenza. Recent studies have indicated that the poor performance of the RAT approach and nonspecific detec-tion of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was the main obstacle to their widespread use in private clinics. 1,2 With the need for a new rapid kit with reasonable sensitivity and specificity for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, we developed a new RAT kit in collaboration with company, Standard Diagnostics, Inc., (Yongin-si, Gyonggi, Korea).",

Therefore the ''gold standard'' of virus measurement requires bioassays that examine the ability of viral particles to replicate and further infect other cells. Titration on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in a 96 well plate format is commonly used to measure influenza virus titre. This method is labour intensive, subjective in their read out of cytopathic effect, and takes several days to obtain a result. Microneutralization tests that quantitate neutralizing antibody titres and assays of drugs for antiviral activity also require 96 well based assays of residual virus infectivity. Therefore, technologies that improve on the titration of infectious virus will be of great benefit. This study utilized the xCelligence system (Roche Applied Science), which adopts microelectronic biosensor technology to monitor dynamic, real-time label free and non-invasive analysis of cellular events. 1 The system measures electronic impedance using an array of microelectrodes located at the bottom of each culture well (E-plate 96). Adherent cells are attached to the sensor surface of electrode arrays, and changes in impedance can be detected and recorded. The xCelligence system can monitor cell events induced by viral infection, such as changes in cell number, adhesion, viability, morphology, and motility. Measured electrode impedance is expressed as dimensionless Cell Index and is graphically represented using software to show the phenotypic changes of a cell population over time. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that using this platform to measure real-time cell index has potential to circumvent many of the limitations of the currently established procedures of end point titration of virus infectivity and for microneutralization assays.",

In the case of MDCK cells, the cytopathic effect is cell death, which is indicative of the presence of live influenza virus infecting and replicating in the cells. Therefore, the titre of the virus is taken as the last dilution in which cytopathic effect is present. Parallel realtime cell index measurements demonstrated that for wells with cytopathic effects, the profile exhibits a steep gradient linear decrease in cell index after infection with the virus, which can be termed the ''CPE plunge.''

The emergence, in April 2009, of a novel H1N1 influenza A virus of swine origin, the pandemic (A(H1N1) 2009), with transmissibility from human to human poses pandemic concern and required modifications to the laboratory testing protocols. 1 Molecular diagnosis of influenza is generally achieved through a twophase process: a screening phase for the detection of virus, and the subsequent strain characterization performed by either sub-type-specific RT-PCR or entire \u2044 partial genome sequencing. 2 During a pandemic, simultaneous implementation of both the detection of influenza A and B influenza viruses and identification of the new subtype is useful for clinical and epidemiological reasons. Here, we describe a new protocol including two-one-step RT-PCRs, Fast Set InfA \u2044 InfB and Fast Set H1N1v (Relab, Italy) that allows universal detection of all influenza A viruses and, simultaneously, all subtypes that are influenza A(H1N1) 2009.",

Furthermore, 1 weak positive sample using Fast Set InfA \u2044 InfB, but negative at block PCR and typing \u2044 subtyping assays was tested. The analytical sensitivity of the test under investigation was determined testing ten-fold serial dilutions of seasonal influenza A(H1N1), seasonal influenza A(H3N2), new pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009, and B cell culture-grown viruses. The intra-assay reproducibility was measured by testing the same A(H1N1) 2009 positive sample 15 times in the same experiment, while the inter-assay reproducibility was confirmed by testing the same samples in 3 independent experiments. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, all samples were tested using a block PCR confirmation test (Seeplex \u00d2 RV12 ACE Detection), 3 and all specimens collected between January 1st and December 31st, 2009 and dilutions were also assayed using the recommended WHO \u2044 CDC protocol of real-time RTPCR for influenza A(H1N1). Typing and sub typing were performed using the WHO protocol and \u2044 or sequencing. 4 Viral RNA was extracted from swabs using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fast Set InfA \u2044 InfB and Fast Set H1N1v are two multiplex one-step Real Time PCR assays developed and evaluated by the Liguria Regional Reference Centre for diagnosis and surveillance of influenza in collaboration with Relab Diagnostics.

A recent report demonstrated that the SW InfA assay is not specific to A(H1N1) 2009 and is able to detect both human and avian (H5N1) influenza A viruses and so there is the potential for misidentification. 15 High titre (Ct 8AE5 and 15AE6 at Fast Set InfA \u2044 InfB) A(H5N1) viruses did not react with Fast Set H1N1v primer-and-probe set (data not shown). Available human A(H5N1) sequences are similar within the H1N1v primer-and-probe regions, but having 4-5 mismatches in the forward primer and, more notably, two of the mismatches occurred within 9 nucleotides of the 3 end, an important determinant for primer specificity.

Results: transition to winter is concomitant with upsurge of ILI cases and ILI drug sales. In addition, more rural folks manage ILI infections on self medicament than through clinical consultancy. Inefficient and vague data collections were observed. A successful implementation of WCIS will create a platform upon which challenges faced in Djibouti Health Department in routine surveillance will be addressed to achieve a near-real time surveillance of flu pandemic.

This dampened their confidence; they cannot state precisely as to when, how, where, and which of the Spanish flu-like pandemic will occur in the future. In support of scientific community and governments, the WHO hasn't gone to slumber, but is reminding its member states to up their post pandemic surveillance and monitoring of influenza virus in circulation for advance preparedness in case of an outbreak. 1 Despite all uncertainty around the pandemic flu H1N1 2009, there remains a common knowledge and understanding that this flu has shown a great potential to evolve and cause huge morbidity and mortality. Although its future magnitude may be unpredictable, its recurring events have severe consequences on human health and the economic well being of everyone. 1 And therefore, advance planning and preparedness is critical in protecting any population in the future, especially those located in resource limited environment without universal health cover and generous disaster emergency funds. 2 . Two collapsed sets of a weekly and monthly mean data (of four years period) were clustered in five categories of ILI cases, drug sales, lab results, vaccine consumption, and health promotion. This was followed by a descriptive statistics analysis of cumulative weekly and monthly data to establish presence or absence of trend. Time series analysis was not done due to data limitation.

Our finding indicates the winter season predisposes one to ILI infections; they therefore opt for medical services or self medication depending on their capability and \u2044 or understanding. In Djibouti, almost no city dwellers favors self medication over clinical consultation, suggesting the presence of inhibitory factors like distance from the health centers and the cost of accessing consultancy. Common in the absence of universal primary health care setting, it therefore calls for active innovativeness in outbreak detection, disease reporting, and preventive medicine on the part of health authority so as to achieve good population health. 7 In respond to these, NIPH has turned resource limitation to a motivation instead and is working towards institutionalizing a near-real-time syndromic surveillance system as a core functional unit.

In addition, creating awareness to data entry personnel on the importance of careful and completeness of entries is important, as is the need to reformat data collection forms to capture exact aspects of surveillance needs for relevant executable analysis. 8 Besides alerting for immediate impending epidemics, these data can also be adopted for projective predictive modeling of annual epidemics, including that for influenza. 9 EHESP WCIC-study input: Djibouti WCIC-study is complementary to the existing syndromic surveillance system, but with emphasis on flu and flu-like illness. Various innovations as suggested above are used in seeking to overcome the prevailing challenges. While every attempt is made to realize its (WCIC-study) objective and for global comparison, lessons learned from successful implementation will form a platform for future refined syndromic surveillance protocol as equally reported elsewhere in Asian countries. 7, 10 Information Technology: National Institute of Public Health Djibouti has an informatics department with sufficient working PCs and personnel to execute efficient data collection and management for epidemiological analysis. However, licensing cost of near-real time syndromic surveillance software is prohibitive, but the open access software with capacity to generate custom graphs, maps, plots, and temporal-spatial analysis output for specific syndromes should make implementation a lot easier. Such output for conditions like flu (or gastroenteritis) will be essential to cause prompt response of the local Public Health Office and International Partners in saving lives and suffering of Djibouti people. 11 ",

We compared reactivity to the novel virus strain using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays performed on discarded plasma specimens left over from routine testing. Samples were taken from healthy adult blood donors (>16 years) before and after the pH1N1 influenza epidemic that occurred during the Southern Hemisphere winter of 2009, and again prior to onset of the 2010 Southern Hemisphere influenza season. Reactivity to the novel H1N1 2009 strain of influenza was relatively uncommon among the healthy adult population during the first Australian winter wave, rising from a baseline of 12% to 22%. A further increase in the seropositive proportion from 22% to 43% was observed over the summer months, most likely attributable to immunisation. This level of immunity appears to have been sufficient to constrain the 2010 winter epidemic. Together with a final serum collection, planned for late 2010, these data will aid evaluation of the extent and severity of disease in this 'second wave' of pH1N1.",

The epidemic was experienced in a staggered fashion around the country, 1 reflecting the considerable geographical distances between state and territory capital cities ( Figure 1 ). Differences in the intensity of case-finding during the evolving pandemic response and between jurisdictions hindered comparisons of disease burden in distinct geographical regions. 2 Rates of reported hospitalisations and deaths appeared fairly similar across states 1 but, without a consistent exposure denominator, assessment of relative severity was difficult. We conducted a national serosurvey of antibody to pH1N1 using residual plasma from healthy blood donors collected before and after the 2009 epidemic to estimate pH1N1 exposure. 3 Here we report the findings of that first collection, together with new data on seroprevalence of pH1N1 antibody in specimens gathered in March-April 2010. These latter samples were collected prior to onset of seasonal influenza activity to assess the impact of a national pH1N1 vaccine program conducted in Spring \u2044 Summer 2009 \u2044 10 on the proportion of individuals with antibody titres deemed protective. 4 Findings informed estimates of population susceptibility to pH1N1 prior to the 2010 influenza season and provided a baseline for a subsequent serosurvey that will be collected at the end of 2010 to assess the extent of exposure during the 'second wave.' tralian Red Cross Blood Service (the Blood Service) for dengue fever surveillance studies. These samples were used to provide a baseline estimate of prevalence of cross-reactive antibody to pH1N1 in the Australian population.",

This latter estimate is in keeping with recently published figures for adult pH1N1 vaccine coverage from a national immunisation survey conducted by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. 4 In that survey, vaccine coverage was significantly higher in Tasmania than in other states, but mostly in those over 65 years of age, possibly in a subgroup whose health status may have differed from that of the donor population. 4 No allowance has been made in this analysis for likely waning of natural or vaccine induced immunity, possibly resulting in lower estimates of natural and \u2044 or vaccine exposure than may have occurred over the period. Regardless of such intervening processes, the seropositive proportion among Australian adults at the start of the 2010 winter season appeared likely to be sufficient to constrain transmission of infection in the age groups tested. This assertion has been borne out in practice, with only modest levels of influenza reported during the late and protracted 2010 season. 7 A final serum collection is planned for the end of the 2010 influenza season in Australia from which to assess the level of exposure in relation to the baseline observed here.",

This group plays an important role in the transmission of Influenza. In Germany, during the summer peak, pandemic hardly spread within this group. This might be explained by the timing of the summer school holidays, which started between EW 27 and 31. Since mid October, after the autumn holidays, the school-aged children began to be more affected, and the proportion increased from 16% in the initiation period to 43AE8% in the acceleration period. 3 In Australia, 55% of H1N1 cases were school aged children (5-17 years), with a median age of 16 years (29% of cases were aged 13-17 years and, and 26% between 5-12 years). 4 In Canada, the infection rate was highest in this group. 5 In Chile, the incidence rate was 4500 \u2044 100 000 inhabitants, although in general they had mild desease. 6 School closure can operate as a proactive measure, aimed at reducing transmission in the school and spread into the wider community, or reactive, when the high levels of absenteeism among students and staff make it impractical to continue classes. The main health benefit of proactive school closure comes from slowing down the spread of an outbreak within a given area and, thus, flattening the peak of infections. This benefit becomes especially important when the number of people requiring medical care threatens to saturate health care capacity. It has its greatest benefits when schools are closed very early in an outbreak, before 1% of the population falls ill. School closure can reduce the demand for health care by an estimated 30-50% at the peak of the pandemic under ideal conditions, but too late in the course of a community-wide outbreak, the resulting reduction in transmission is likely to be very limited. Policies for school closure need to include measures that limit contact among students when they are not in school. 7",

First, we have used antibody titers of \u20211:40 by viral microneutralization as an indicator of recent infection, correcting for pre-existing seroprevalence levels, but this may lead to underestima-tion of the IAR if some infections led to antibody titers <1:40, or if some individuals with baseline titers \u20211:40 were infected. Second, our estimates of the IAR would be biased upwards if infection with other circulating influenza viruses led to cross-reactive antibody responses resulting in antibody titers \u20211:40. However between August and October 2009, 83% of influenza A viruses detected in Hong Kong were pdmH1N1, and only 3% of isolated viruses were seasonal H1N1 viruses. 10 Third, a minority of severe illnesses associated with pdmH1N1 infection might not be identified by molecular detection methods, for example if admission occurred after viral shedding from the primary infection has ceased, in which case we may have underestimated the disease burden of pdmH1N1. Finally, our analyses are primarily based on seroprevalence among blood donors to the Hong Kong Red Cross, who may not be representative of the whole population. We do not have detailed data on donors to compare their risk of infection with the general population, but we did observe very similar seroprevalence rates across the three groups of subjects in our study, i.e., blood donors, hospital outpatients and participants in a community cohort (data not shown).",

Compared to school-children aged 5-14, older adults aged 50-59, though less likely to acquire infection, had 9AE5 and 66 times higher risk of ICU-admission and death if infected. Thus, although the IAR of pdmH1N1 is similar to that of a seasonal epidemic, the apparently low morbidity and mortality of 2009 pandemic influenza (H1N1) appears to be due to low infection rates in older adults who had a much greater risk of severe illness if infected. The reasons why older adults appear relatively resistant to pdmH1N1 infection even though they appear to lack neutralizing antibody remains unclear. If antigenic drift or other adaptation of the pdmH1N1 virus allows these older age groups to be infected more efficiently, the morbidity and mortality of subsequent waves of the pandemic could yet become substantial. and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (Contract No. HHSN266200700005C; ADB No. N01-AI-70005).

            "text": "It is well known that a primary goal of vaccination is to generate immunological memory against the targeted antigen to prevent disease in a vaccinated person. This ensures an accelerated immune response in the event of future contact with the pathogenic agent, such as a virus. Therefore, it is very important to develop criteria for the assessment of vaccine immunogenicity by measuring both T and B memory cell levels from the vaccinated host. In contrast to inactivated influenza vaccines, live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) have been shown to provide primarily cellular and local immune responses. 1-3 To date, however, the hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) test (i.e. detection of serum antibodies) remains the method widely accepted for evaluation of an influenza vaccine's immunogenicity. Improved understanding of the role of cellular and mucosal immunity and their contribution to protecting against severe illness caused by influenza infection has emphasized the need to reconsider methodologies used to evaluate the immunogenic impact of various influenza vaccines. Such new assays need to include methods to measure local antibodies and virus-specific lymphocytes, especially in the case of live attenuated influenza vaccines, because of their potential to induce such broad-based immune responses. 4 The aim of this study was to assess the ability of new Russian pandemic LAIVs A \u2044 17 \u2044 Duck \u2044 Potsdam \u2044 86 \u2044 92 (H5N2) ('Ultragrivak,' registered 25AE03AE2009) and A \u2044 17 \u2044 California \u2044 2009 \u2044 38 (H1N1) ('Influvir,' registered 13AE10AE2009) to induce memory T-cells in na\u00efve human subjects and to compare results to levels of HAI antibodies from each subject.",

After the first vaccination, a 10% conversion rate of sIgA was observed; after the second vaccination, 60% showed conversions in levels of sIGA. The first vaccination with A \u2044 17 \u2044 California \u2044 2009 \u2044 38 (H1N1) LAIV showed 6AE3% of HAI antibodies seroconversions vaccination, and 50% seroconversion after second vaccination.

Figure 1 summarizes cellular immune responses observed in the vaccinated versus the placebo group. After the influenza A (H5N2) LAIV inoculation, significant differences in both CD4 and CD8 IFNc-producing T-cells were observed at day 42 after the second vaccination (d63). These data indicate that healthy young people who never received such avian influenza vaccines and were not exposed to H5N1 wild-type viruses were able to respond to the live attenuated H5N2 influenza vaccine. After the first influenza A (H1N1) LAIV vaccination, reliable increases were observed in CD8 + cells only. After the second vaccination, increases in both CD4 + and CD8 + fold changes were significantly higher in vaccinated volunteers compared to the placebo group.

Results: Prior challenge with influenza contributed to aberrant cytokine \u2044 chemokine profiles and increased lung cellular infiltrate in response to secondary bacterial infection across all age groups, supporting a critical role for influenza infection in the alteration of immune responses to other pathogens. Also similar to human influenza, these changes were exacerbated by age in mice as demonstrated by increased bacterial load, mortality, and total lung protein content (an indicator of lung damage) after P. aeruginosa challenge. Conclusions: These data support a potential role for virus-mediated and age-mediated alteration of innate immune effectors in the pathogenesis of influenza and the increased susceptibility of influenza virus infected mice to secondary bacterial infection. The understanding of the complex interaction of host and pathogen -and the role of age -in human influenza is critical in the development of novel therapeutics and improved vaccine approaches for influenza.

Female Balb \u2044 C mice used in these studies were divided into three age groups: aged (18 months old), adult (6 months old), and young (2 months old). Each age group was subdivided into two groups: influenza infected and na\u00efve (control). Mice were infected by the intranasal route with 4 \u00b7 10 5 PFU of mouse-adapted Influenza A \u2044 PR \u2044 8 \u2044 34. Clinical disease was measured by body weight changes over a 6 week period post influenza challenge, and recovery was determined as return to pre-infection weight. All mice were subsequently challenged intransally with1 \u00b7 10 7 CFU Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1. Twenty-four hours post-Pseudomonas challenge, BAL with sterile PBS was performed on all mice in all groups. Total RNA from the cellular fraction was pooled from three experimental animals from each group. TLR mRNA was detected by qRT-PCR, where expression levels were determined as relative to b-actin mRNA levels. cDNA was synthesized from total cellular RNA from BAL samples using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad). PCR reactions were composed of 0AE1 lg cDNA forward and reverse primers according to optimized conditions and 12AE5 ll of 2 \u00b7 Syber Green icycler supermix (Biorad), in a total vol-ume of 25 ll and were run using a Biorad iCycler utilizing melting point determination. Primers and concentrations used in this study included: MUS_TLR2F: TGCTTTCCT-GCTGGAGATTT-600 nm, MUS_TLR2R: TGTAACGCAAC AGCTTCAGG-900 nm, MUS_TLR3F: ATATGCGCTTCAA TCCGTTC-300 nm, MUS_TLR3R: CAGGAGCATACTGGT GCTGA-600 nm, MUS_TLR4F: GGCAGCAGGTGGAATTG TAT-600 nm, MUS_TLR4R: AGGCCCCAGAGTTTTGTTC T-900 nm, MUS_TLR5F: CTGGGGACCCAGTATGCTAA-600 nm, MUS_TLR5R: ACAGCCGAAGTTCCAAGAGA-900 nm, MUS_TLR7F: GGAGCTCTGTCCTTGAGTGG-900 nm, MUS_TLR7R: CAAGGCATGTCCTAGGTGGT-600 nm, MUS_ B-ACTINF: AGCCATGTACGTAGCCATCC-600 nm, MUS_B-ACTINR: CTCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAA-900 nm. As a measure of protein leakage into the alveolar space, total protein content in each BAL was measured by BCA assay of each supernatant fraction according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Cytokine and chemokines levels were measured by multiplexed bead array (Bioplex, BioRad). Immune cell characterization of BAL was estimated by flow cytometry. Lymphocyte populations were gated by forward versus side scatter and characterized as B cells (F4 \u2044 80 ) , CD19 + ) or T cells (CD11b ) , CD4 + ). The myeloid population that is composed of macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells was enumerated by gating all but those found in the lymphocyte gate using forward versus side scatter plots. Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FloJo software (TreeStar). Statistical analysis, where appropriate, was performed using a two-way analysis of variance (age versus influenza infection status) supported by Bonferonni's correction for multiple comparisons. 8 ",

These findings highlight distinct differences in the immune environment between age groups and thus reveal necessity for further examination as to the mechanisms of immunity across age with respect to current infection status. Garnering a clearer understanding as to the complex interaction of host and pathogen with respect to age in influenza infections is central to the development of increased efficacy in vaccine and therapeutic strategies. Prospective estimation of the effective reproduction Background Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (pH1N1) emerged in early 2009 and rapidly spread to every continent. An urgent priority for international and national public health authorities was to estimate the transmissibility of the pandemic strain for situational awareness and to permit calibration of mitigation strategies. The basic reproductive number, R 0 , is defined as the average number of secondary cases that 1 index case generates in a completely susceptible population, and is a common measure of transmissibility. However, it is difficult to estimate R 0 without an understanding of the degree of any pre-existing immunity in the population. The effective reproductive number, R, is defined as the average number of secondary cases that 1 index case generates, and can be estimated over time (i.e. R t ). Wallinga and Teunis 1 described a method to estimate R t based on illness onset dates of the cases while assuming that all secondary cases would have been detected, and Cauchemez et al. 2 extended the method to permit prospective estimation by adjusting for secondary cases that have not yet experienced illness onset at the time of analysis. We describe how the method can further be extended to account for reporting delays, allowing true real-time estimation of R t during an epidemic, and we illustrate the methodology on notifications of pH1N1 and associated hospitalizations in Hong Kong.",

These measures included screening at ports, airports, and border crossings, and enhanced surveillance for people with influenza-like illness, particularly for those who had recently returned from abroad. Laboratory testing capacity was substantial due to heavy investment in local infrastructure following previous experiences with avian influenza A \u2044 H5N1 in 1997 and severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003. Laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases were isolated until recovery, and their close contacts were placed under quarantine for 7 days. Imported cases were identified sporadically through May and early June 2009. The first case of pH1N1 not traceable to importation (i.e. a local case) was identified on June 11 and triggered a change to mitigation phase measures. Some containment measures, including isolation of cases, were continued until the end of June to allow a soft transition between containment and mitigation phases. As an immediate measure to try to reduce community transmission of pH1N1, all childcare centres, kindergartens, and primary schools were proactively closed for 14 days (subsequently extended for another 7-14 days to summer vacation in early July). 8 Any secondary schools in which one or more confirmed pH1N1 case was identified were reactively closed for 7 days. On June 13 the government opened eight designated flu clinics across the territory to provide free medical consultation for outpatients with influenza-like illness and free laboratory testing for pH1N1. These clinics resumed regular chronic disease services in mid-August, and laboratory testing and antiviral treatment was restricted to high risk groups in September. The various interventions are highlighted in Figure 1 (A), superimposed on the epidemic curve of laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases and pH1N1-associated hospitalizations. Around 15% of the cases were hospitalised, and this proportion increased somewhat towards the end of the epidemic. 3 Figure 1(B) shows the estimates of R t based on laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases. The estimated R t peaked at 1AE5 on June 12, and fell below 1 between 20 June and 3 July (which was within the school closure period). R t fluctuated between 0AE8 and 1AE3 through the school summer vacations in July and August, it subsequently increased to around 1AE2-1AE3 after schools reopened in September until the epidemic peaked in late September, and then fluctuated below 1 as the epidemic declined. The trends in R t based on H1N1-associated hospitalizations were similar, although with wider confidence intervals due to the smaller number of events ( Figure 1C ). The extension of the methods to allow for reporting delays avoided substantial bias in realtime estimates of R during the epidemic for the most recent 7 days, and closely tracked the final estimates of R t . 3",

Therefore our estimates can only provide a snapshot of the overall trend, but limited information for any specific subset of population. Secondly, we did not consider the possibility that cases might be infected in Hong Kong and exported to other countries, which could lead to slight underestimation of the transmissibility. One has to be careful in translating the estimated R t to the effectiveness of any specific interventions, as interventions may not be the only factor influencing the transmissibility; for example, a depletion of the susceptible population during an epidemic can also be a factor for the decline in R t . 12 In conclusion, real-time monitoring of the effective reproduction number is feasible and can provide useful information to public health authorities for situational awareness and planning. In affected regions, laboratory capacity was typically focused on more severe cases, and changes in laboratory testing and notification rates meant that that case counts may not necessarily reflect the underlying epidemic. A useful alternative to case-based surveillance is surveillance of the subset of severe infections, for example hospital admissions, or ICU admissions, 13 and our results show that it was feasible to monitor pH1N1-associated admissions in real-time to estimate transmissibility.",

Based on his or her renting history and the ratings in the systems (e.g., from evaluators and other renters), Netflix recommendation system suggests certain movies to a renter. Apparently, no individuals would be feasible to provide ratings for all of the movies, as it will take hundreds of years for a single person to rate over 50 000 movies available from Netflix. Thus, the resulting rating data is an incomplete matrix, and it can be as sparse as less as 1%. 4 The challenge in Netflix recommendation system is a classic MC problem. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] As the inspiration of Netflix Prize contest, many efficient low rank MC algorithms were developed, for instance, Opt-Space, 7 SVT, 5 CF, 9 BellKor, 10 PF, 11 and FWLS. 12 Eventually, the team BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos won this contest. Their methods combines nonlinear probe blending and linear quiz blending to come up with a predictor BigChaos. 13 Matrix completion estimates the unobserved values based on the observed values. The users can refill the missing data without repeating the experiments.

The reported 11 clusters (HK68, EN72, VI75, TX77, BK79, SI87, BE89, BE92, WU95, SY97, and FU02) were displayed in the core of a spiral S-shape, and BK79 and BE92 are located at the turning point of this S-shape. However, the antigenic distances between some viruses are incorrect. For example, the distance between HK68 and FU02 in the projection is 7AE1223 units, which is close to the distance between HK68 and BK79 (6AE5113 units). The main reason leading to those inaccurate distances is the unique distribution of HI datasets described in section 2.3. In comparison, with the temporal model, not only the viruses in 11 clusters have been clearly separated, but also the antigenic distances between each cluster are proportional to their isolation time interval. In this updated cartography ( Figure 2B ), the antigenic distance between HK68 and FU02 is 15AE0633 units, where the distance between HK68 and FU02 is 6AE3984 units. This result suggested that the temporal information is critical for antigenic cartography construction for immunological datasets spanning a long time period. The HI data from seasonal influenza surveillance belong to this category. For seasonal influenza virus \u2044 pandemic influenza viruses within a short time span, the temporal model is probably not necessary, as there is lack of long-term immunological pressure present in the population. Figure 2 (C) is an antigenic cartography generated using a HI dataset with 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses spanning from April of 2009 to June of 2009. This map demonstrates that there is lack of antigenic drifts during the first wave of this pandemic influenza as all of these viruses are mixed altogether.",

Nevertheless, the model fit still mirrors many characteristics of the data, particularly for Leicester. We note that for this model, a 1 is very near the lower limit, corresponding to ubiquitous exposure in the first wave. In this scenario, refuelling of the susceptible pool to generate secondary and tertiary waves is still possible due to a shorter waning time of acquired protection (well within 3 months) and a lower probability of gaining permanent protection following infection, when compared with the parameter estimate for hypothesis 1. The parameter estimates suggest that approximately 50% of the population initially experiences reduced disease severity (e a $ 0AE66), but similar susceptibility and infectiousness.

It is challenging to construct a deterministic model for the spread of disease within multiple locations in the UK in 1918, which assumes homogeneous mixing without modulation of the transmission rate by social distancing. An improved model working with these assumptions likely requires a richer structure for the host protection response than the structures we have explored thus far.

The 2009 H1N1 experience in Australia and elsewhere highlighted the difficulties faced by public health authorities in diagnosing infections and delivering antiviral agents (e.g. oseltamivir) as treatment for cases and prophylaxis for contacts in a timely manner. Consequently, forecasts from mathematical models of the possible benefits of widespread antiviral interventions were largely unmet. We summarise results from a recently developed model that includes realworld constraints, such as finite diagnostic and antiviral distribution capacities. We find that use of antiviral agents might be capable of containing or substantially mitigating an epidemic in only a small proportion of epidemic scenarios given Australia's existing public health capacities.

Pandemic response plans are presently being revised in light of the 2009 H1N1 experience. [1] [2] [3] Many developed countries amassed large stockpiles of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) with the expectation that they could be used to not only treat the most severely ill, but curb transmission in the community. Without relevant field experience indicating how NAIs should be distributed, mathematical and computational modelling has been used to inform optimal deployment policy in a pandemic scenario. 4-10 Models of population transmission were used to infer likely effects on epidemic dynamics, using data from human and animal studies of experimental infection and NAI efficacy trials. In the Australian (and wider) context, models indicated the potential for substantial benefit at the population level if NAIs were distributed in a liberal manner, targeting close contacts of indentified cases. 11 Furthermore, results indicated that use of limited NAI resources in this way may improve the impact of case treatment due to the effects on epidemic dynamics. 11 However, these models did not take into account logistic and other real-world constraints, such as finite diagnostic and antiviral distribution capacities, which were identified as limiting factors during the Australian 2009 H1N1 pandemic response. [12] [13] [14] In particular, if using positive PCR diagnosis as a 'decision to treat' test, delays to confirmation of diagnosis, particularly once total laboratory capacity was exceeded, prevented timely delivery of NAIs to both cases and contacts of cases. 12 In previous work, 15 we have extended our existing models to examine how diagnostic strategies [e.g. using PCR confirmation versus syndromic influenza-like illness (ILI) presentation as a decision to treat], diagnostic-capacity, and NAI distribution capacity each impact on the ability to deliver an effective intervention. The model uses case severity (the proportion of infections deemed severe) to determine the overall presentation proportion, and so the ability to identify individuals eligible for NAI treatment and contact prophylaxis. Figure 1 (A) shows a key result from the model. For each curve shown, we simulated thousands of epidemics, sam-pling across plausible ranges of parameters describing virus, population, and intervention characteristics using a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) approach. Without intervention, the proportion of the population infected either symptomatically or subclinically by the end of the epidemic is around 50%. If a syndromic strategy (ILI presentation) is used to determine provision of NAIs as treatment and prophylaxis, excessive distribution of drug to individuals who are not infected with influenza occurs early in the epidemic. Early stockpile expiry accounts for a marginal impact of the antiviral intervention on the final outbreak size, in the order of a few percent. The second strategy modelled (PCR \u2044 Syndromic) is one where PCR confirmation of diagnosis is required early in the epidemic to make treatment decisions until such time as laboratory capacity is exceeded. From this point, individuals are treated on the basis of symptoms alone -during an epidemic phase in which a substantial proportion of ILI presentations will be attributable to influenza. Under this strategy, the intervention is able to control the outbreak in approximately 10% of the simulated epidemics given the 'base case' constraints on diagnosis and delivery assumed in the model.",

That is, NAIs provided as treatment have a maximum impact of just a 20% reduction in infectiousness. However, our previous results 4 show a strong synergistic effect of treatment when overlayed on a contact prophylaxis strategy, explaining the observation here that e t is critical in determining likely success of an intervention. Despite the limited impact of treatment at the individual-level, the model outcomes are highly sensitive to the value of the relative infectiousness of treated cases. It follows that determination of e t is important for predicting the population-level outcome of a control effort. A 'small' reduction (of the order approximately 10%) may be extremely valuable in terms of success of a public health control strategy, and so should not be discounted.",

The model demonstrates an excellent degree of accuracy when applied to synthetic data. The choice of parameters for the regression model was restricted to those that were both highly correlated with the success of the intervention and hopefully feasible to measure during the early stages of an emerging epidemic. The model could therefore be a useful near real-time decision support tool for public health policy in the face of an influenza epidemic, although further validation on a range of synthetic data (and real-world data where available) is required. influenza to seasonal flu status to avoid overstretching the demands on healthcare services. A great deal of information has emerged as the result of the pandemic response exercises conducted by affected countries. However, uncertainties remain regarding the effectiveness of intervention measures, as well as the feasibility and the timing of their implementation. Mathematical and computational models [2] [3] [4] have been used to project the outcomes of influenza outbreaks under various scenarios and epidemiological hypotheses. Motivated by the events of 2009 and public health measures adopted by the Taiwan CDC, we use a stochastic, individual-based simulation model 5 to study the spatio-temporal transmission characteristics of the H1N1 virus, so as to quantitatively assess the effects of early intervention strategies.",

Based on their attributes and the time of day, each individual is assigned to miscellaneous contact groups, where the potential of interactions between any two individuals resulting in flu virus transmission occurs.

In other simulation scenarios, a national vaccination campaign has very little impact on the outcome, due to the late start of the vaccination schedule. We then explore the effect of a national vaccination campaign with various starting dates. The simulation results are illustrated in Figure 2 , where the benefit of an early start date for mass vaccination is clearly demonstrated. Considering a scenario with an 80% airport exit screening success rate, 80% airport entry screening success rate and 80% symptomatic case tracing success rate, the combined intervention strategy results in: a 2% reduction in CAR if the vaccination campaign starts in mid-November; 11% reduction if the campaign starts in mid-October; 26% reduction if the campaign starts in mid-September; and 37% reduction if the campaign starts in mid-August.",

As the H1N1 cases increased worldwide, various revised plans were adopted and implemented; such as the shift from labor-extensive on-board quarantine inspection to the Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System and Realtime Outbreak and Disease Surveillance System in order to effectively track down symptomatic and exposed passengers, apply prophylaxis treatment and mandatory in-home quarantine.

Moreover, with nearly 50% of the infected passengers presenting no symptoms whatsoever, they are not detectable by any port authority's screening procedures, and the importation of the novel flu virus is therefore inevitable. Many studies conclude that entry screening is unlikely to be effective in preventing or delaying the importation of influenza, and has negligible impact on the course of subsequent epidemic. However, these studies are based on the assumption that effective exit screening is in place. Our study shows that as the exit screening success rate decreases, the sensitivity of the entry screening policy becomes more pronounced.

Although pandemic virus reconstituted from the high mortality waves has proven to have high virulence in animals, 5 it has not been possible to recover virus from the first wave in 1918 for comparative purposes. Indeed it is questionable whether virulence mutation(s) occurring between wave 1 and wave 2 could have spread to so many different populations in the time-frames observed. Furthermore, in all three pandemic waves, there was the same agedistribution of mortality, with more deaths occurring amongst younger adults than older adults. [1] [2] [3] This 'pandemic signature', arguably due to immune protection of older adults who were exposed to a similar virus in the years before 1890, 6, 7 suggests that the 1918-1919 viruses were at least immunologically similar in all three waves.",

The underlying idea is that the mortality rate in the first wave was lower than in later waves because most persons were protected by prior immunity in the first wave, and that the mortality was higher in later waves because of waning of that short-lived immunity. This hypothesis builds on our earlier modelling papers suggesting that even before the first wave in 1918, military, 10 school, and urban 11 populations in England and Wales apparently had (short-lived) immune protection, presumably induced by recent prior exposure to seasonal influenza. [10] [11] [12] We suggest that this short-lived strain-transcending protection was in addition to the longer-lasting immunity, presumably induced by exposures to a similar virus circulating prior to 1890, that arguably reduced pandemic mortality for older adults in 1918-9. 6,7",

From these and the other parameters, it was possible to simulate the behaviour of model A over three waves, and of model B over four waves, and to estimate the expected numbers dying in each wave in each population. We calculated the log likelihood of the observed numbers of deaths given the parameter estimates, and we used MCMC simulation to generate the posterior distributions of parameters.",

The somewhat lesser mortality in wave three and the 'absent fourth wave' can be explained in terms of the progressive acquisition of immunity specific to the pandemic virus.",

            "text": "The credibility estimates for parameters are of potential interest. For example, R 0 estimates of 3.1-4.5 across different populations are consistent with our earlier findings. 10, 11 If all persons had been susceptible, such R 0 values imply that the virus would have infected most people in all populations. However, even in the first wave, the proportion susceptible, S 0 + Q 0 , was <50% in all populations, so that a considerable number of persons escaped productive infection in that wave; as their immunity waned, they became susceptible to infection in the later waves. It is likely that the variation in R 0 between populations is due to different rates of population mixing. Estimates for h indicate that between 5% and 10% of infections in the most susceptible persons were fatal; the higher values of h could reflect higher rates of secondary bacterial infection in the most socially disadvantaged and overcrowded populations. 4 Although we have shown the plausibility of an immunological explanation for wave to wave changes in pandemic mortality, we cannot assume that our particular model is even approximately correct. Nor can we exclude the possibility that the higher mortality in the later pandemic waves in 1918-1919 was because of genetic change in the virus in later waves, or because of changing rates of secondary bacterial infection 8 or seasonal effects. 9 Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that the population spread of pandemic influenza, whether in 1918-1919 10, 11 or in 2009, 12, 14 can be constrained by significant prior immunity, even for viruses that are ostensibly novel. Previous reports, reviewed in Ref. [10, 11] , support the idea of strain-transcending immune protection, which can wane over periods of a few months. This form of protection, probably induced by recent exposure to seasonal influenza, may not be mediated by HI or neutralizing antibody. 11 In contrast, strain-specific immunity, most often mediated by HI or neutralizing antibodies can be so long-lasting that after several decades it will still provide significant protection against any closely-related virus that re-appears in the population. 14 It has not escaped our notice that although attack-rates in the H1N1 2009 pandemic were low in many countries, with generally mild symptoms, the virus did cause lifethreatening illness in a small proportion of younger affected persons. 15 It seems likely that those who were most severely affected in 2009 were doubly unlucky: they had missed out on seasonal influenza infection or vaccination in the preceding season(s), and they were born too late to have been protected by the closely-related viruses that are thought to have circulated before 1950. 14 During the early phases of the 2009 influenza pandemic in Italy, real-time modeling analysis were conducted in order to estimate the impact of the pandemic. In order to evaluate the results obtained by the model we compared simulated epidemics to the estimated number of influenza-like illness (ILI) collected by the Italian sentinel surveillance system (INFLUNET), showing a good agreement with the timing of the observed epidemic. By assuming in the model mitigation measures implemented in Italy, the peak was expected on week 44 (95% CI: 44, 45). Results were consistent with the INFLUNET data showing that the peak in Italy was reached in week 46. These predictions have proved to be a valuable support for public health policy makers for planning interventions for mitigating the spread of the pandemic.",

Thus, after the first pandemic alert was announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in late April 2009, a National Crisis Management Committee headed by the Minister of Health was established in Italy in order to provide weekly advice to the Italian Ministry of Health. Real-time analyses using an individual based model were undertaken. The transmission model was previously used for evaluating the effectiveness of the control measures adopted in the National Pandemic Preparedness Plan 3 and for assessing the age-prioritized distribution of antiviral doses during an influenza pandemic. 2 To parameterize the transmission model, we used data derived from the National Surveillance System until 17 June 2009 and estimates of key epidemiological parameters as available at that time.",

In general, the treatment coverage q increases sharply as the basic reproductive number R 0 and the lumped demand parameter r T p H decrease (Figure 2A ). In particular, when R 0 is large and r T p H is small, q is very sensitive to r T p H , but insensitive to R 0 . Similarly, when R 0 and r T p H are small, q is very sensitive to both. With a donor percentage of q D = 15%, the proposed program can supply passive immunotherapy to more than 82% of severe cases (q > 82%) if R 0 < 1AE4 and r T p H < 1AE5%, but <35% if R 0 > 1AE8 and r T p H > 1AE5%. In general, the treatment coverage q increases sharply as the donor percentage q D rises from 0%, but with rapidly decreasing marginal increase ( Figure 2B ). When R 0 < 1AE4 and r T p H < 1AE5%, q > 67% even if q D is as low as 5%, which is comparable to the current average blood donation rate of 38AE1 donations per 1000 population in developed countries. 12 When q D is >15%, q becomes largely insensitive to further increase in q D in most scenarios. The treatment coverage q for q D = 15% is more than 81% that for q D = 50% across all values of R 0 and r T p H considered in the base case. Therefore, increasing the donor percentage q D beyond 15% has a relatively small impact on CP supply. This is because increasing q D can boost supply only when plasmapheresis is not yet the supply bottleneck. For the same reason, once the donor percentage q D has reached 15%, the treatment coverage q is insensitive to further increase in q D even when the plasmapheresis and screening capacity are doubled ( Figure 2B , lower panel).",

While the dependence of q on r T p H and q S q D is readily comprehensible, it is not obvious a priori that q depends on the natural history and transmission dynamics of the disease via only the initial epidemic growth rate. When the plasmapheresis and screening capacity are very large, the supply-demand dynamics is further simplified: the treatment coverage q depends on lumped demand parameter r T p H and the lumped supply parameter q S q D only via their ratio. Finally, q becomes insensitive to q S q D when the latter increases beyond 15-20%, which is consistent with our base case observations.",

Increasing the donor percentage beyond 15% has little additional benefit because CP supply is constrained by the capacity of plasmapheresis during most stages of the epidemic. Increasing plasmapheresis capacity could significantly boost CP supply, especially when there is a substantial pool of recurrent donors to alleviate the dependence of CP supply on donor percentage. In an ongoing clinical trial of passive immunotherapy for H1N1pdm virus infection in Hong Kong, 20% of convales- cent individuals agreed to donate their plasma for the study. Therefore, the donor percentage required by the proposed passive immunotherapy program (5-15%) is likely to be feasible. In view of the logistical feasibility of such program, we recommend that further clinical studies are conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of passive immunotherapy as a treatment for severe cases of pandemic influenza virus infection.",

In theory, the polyclonal nature of neutralizing antibodies in CP would lower the probability of an escape mutant emerging in treated patients. Further, besides providing neutralizing antibodies against the pandemic virus, CP also might carry antibodies to other bacterial pathogens, which might decrease the severity of coexisting bacterial infections. 4 As such, CP not only might reduce the case fatality rate but might also increase the recovery rate and shorten duration of hospitalization of severe cases. The proposed passive immunotherapy program can thus significantly reduce the burden on the healthcare system, especially the intensive care unit, which will likely be stressed, if not overloaded, at the peak of an influenza pandemic wave, hence benefiting the general public and not only those receiving passive immunotherapy. Although the hypothesized efficacy of CP has yet to be proven in clinical trials, our modeling results show that a public health system similar to that in Hong Kong has the capacity to support a population-wide passive immunotherapy program that can supply CP treatment to a substantial percentage of the severe cases in a moderately severe pandemic. We estimate that compared to other developed countries, Hong Kong has a relatively low plasmapheresis capacity. Our conclusions regarding donor percentage needed and rate-limiting factors remain valid for plasmapheresis capacity ranging from 50% to 400% of what we have assumed in the base case (results not shown).",

At present, antiviral therapy by oseltamivir remains the mainstay for managing H5N1 patients. While early treatment improves survival, approximately 50% of patients treated within 4 days of illness still succumb to the disease. In addition to the role of viral replication, there is good evidence that the host proinflammatory responses contributes to H5N1 pathogenesis. This suggests that both antiviral and immune-modulatory drugs may have a role in therapy. We previously demonstrated that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) plays a regulatory role in H5N1 hyperinduced pro-inflammatory responses, and its inhibitor has potent effects at modulating this host response. Now we demonstrate that, in addition to its immune-modulatory effect, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398 has a direct antiviral effect against H5N1 infection.",

            "text": "However, a few reports have suggested the importance of COX-2 in the late stage of inflammation for the resulution of inflammation, [6] [7] [8] and this raises concern whether inhibition of COX-2 may be harmful in treating diseases related to dysregulation of host inflammatory response such as acute lung injury, 9 which is a leading cause of death in H5N1 patients. We previously looked at the autopsy samples of lung tissues from H5N1 patients and found that COX-2 expression was markedly up-regulated compared with that from persons who died of non-respiratory causes. 1 Moreover, data also demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, was markedly elevated in the H5N1 infected lung autopsies. 10 Taken together, with the histo-pathological findings, which showed predominant features of exudative inflammatory phase in autopsy lung samples from H5N1 patients, 11, 12 we may therefore speculate that people who had fatal H5N1 infection died during acute inflammation phase, and before the resolution could occur, especially for the cases with a short disease duration (<10-12 days). 13 In conclusion, the roles of COX-2 in both pro-inflammation and pro-resolution phases deserves detailed investi-gation. The timing of selective COX-2 inhibitor therapy in H5N1 infected patients may be extremely critical. Therefore a time-dependent study using selective COX-2 inhibitors on H5N1-infected animal models will be particularly important in order to address the effectiveness of this drug in treating H5N1 disease.",

Here, we report that virus-specific immunoglobulin Y (IgY) isolated from eggs of immunized hens provide protection in mice against lethal H5N1 virus infection by neutralization of the viruses in the lungs upon intranasal administration. Importantly, chicken eggs obtained from randomly selected supermarkets and farms in Vietnam, where mass poultry vaccination against A \u2044 H5N1 is mandatory, contain high levels of IgY specific for A \u2044 H5N1 virus. When administered before or after the infection, IgY prevented and significantly reduced replication and spread of HPAIV H5N1 and related H5N2 strains. Thus, the consumable eggs readily available in markets of countries that impose poultry vaccination against A \u2044 H5N1 could offer an enormous source of valuable biological material that provides protection against A \u2044 H5N1 virus with pandemic potential.

H5N1 influenza virus remains a global threat because of its continued transmission among domestic poultry and wild birds. Passive immunization (the transfer of antigen-specific antibodies (Abs) to a previously non-immune recipient host) offers an alternative and \u2044 or additional countermeasure against influenza. 1 Development of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against H5N1 influenza haemagglutinin (HA) using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immortalization of B cells isolated from patients infected with H5N1, 2 phage display, 3 humanized mAbs, 4 and human recombinant Abs 5 has been attempted. Chickens produce a unique immunoglobulin molecule called IgY that is functionally equivalent to mammalian IgG. 6 IgY is found in the sera of chickens and is passed from hens to the embryo via the egg yolk. 7 Egg IgY has been used to prevent bacterial and viral infections (see review 8 ) of the gastrointestinal tract and recently for protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). 9 The epidemic of HPAIV H5N1 virus has resulted in serious economic losses to the poultry industry, mostly in Southeast Asia. Therefore, many countries including China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam have introduced mass vaccination of poultry with H5N1 virus vaccines that controls the H5N1 epidemic to some extent. 10 Chickens immunized with recombinant H5 and \u2044 or inactivated H5N1 reassortant vaccines produced a high level of virus-specific serum antibodies (Abs) and were protected from H5N1 virus challenge. 11 Theoretically, these Abs could be found in egg yolk and separated for use in humans to prevent and cure H5N1 HPAIV infection and disease, respectively. Here, we examined the possibility that IgY isolated from consumable eggs available in supermarkets in Vietnam, where mandatory H5N1 vaccination has been implemented, provide prophylaxis and therapy of HPAIV H5N1 infection in mice.",

Such treated mice displayed mild weight loss and recovered completely by the end of the first week after inoculation ( Figure 1A ). When animals were treated once with H5N1specific IgY after H5N1 inoculation they exhibited minimal weight loss during the first week after inoculation, and virus titers in the lungs were substantial reduced at day 3 after infection; however, 50% of treated mice succumbed to infection during the second week after inoculation ( Figure 1B) . It is possible that not all the HPAIV A \u2044 H5N1 viruses were neutralized upon the single treatment with IgY, and escaping viruses can spread systemically to organs outside of the lungs. These viruses may reappear in lung tissue later when specific IgY is absent. Indeed, VN \u2044 1203 virus injected intravenously or into the brain can spread to the lungs. 18 To circumvent the virus escape, we administered multiple treatments with H5N1specific IgY after the infection. As a result, all infected mice recovered completely by the second week post-infection ( Figure 1C) , and virus titers in the lungs were substantially reduced to the level that seen in protected mice that received single prior-infection treatment ( Figure 1D) .

The results indicate that H5N1-specific IgY isolated from eggs purchased in markets have preventive and therapeutic effects against infection with HPAIV H5N1 and the related strain H5N2. The findings suggest that while a single treatment with IgY prior to lethal infection was sufficient to protect the animals from the infection, multiple treatment is required for complete therapeutic effect after infection with HPAIV such as VN \u2044 1203 strain.",

Intranasal administration is the most effective route as compared to oral or peritoneal or intravenous administration for protection against lethal challenge, and the presence of virus-specific IgY in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is required for the protection. The results provide a proof-of-concept that intranasal administration of virus-specific IgY prevents influenza virus infection and cures the disease. The concept could be applied to control influenza outbreaks including seasonal and pandemic influenza.

The use of IgY immunotherapy has many advantages, since IgY does not activate the human complement system or human Fc-receptors, which all are well-known cell activators and mediators of inflammation. 20 We chose the water dilution method for preparation of IgY. The method is simple, efficient and does not require any toxic compounds or any additives. Such IgY preparations by this method have been used in other human study. 9, 21 Eggs are normal dietary components, so there is minimal risk of toxic side effects, except for those with egg allergy. Thus, our study demonstrated that influenza virus-specific IgY can be used in passive immunization that provides great help for immunocompromised patients and elderly who have weaken immune response to influenza vaccines. Importantly, the consumable eggs readily available in the markets of countries that impose mandatory H5N1 vaccination offer an enormous source of valuable, affordable, and safe biological material for prevention and protection against potential H5N1 pandemic influenza.",

The polyphenol rich plant extract CYSTUS052 is highly Introduction The 2009 \u2044 2010 H1N1influenza A virus pandemic clearly demonstrates that influenza is still a major risk for the public health. Although the pandemic swine origin influenza A virus (SOIV) caused only mild symptoms, the control of the outbreak still remains difficult. Even as vaccine is available against this virus, the possibility of reassortment between the pandemic and a seasonal or avian A \u2044 H5N1 influenza virus strain is indeed a frightening, but a likely event. This reassortant strain might be able to transmit easily between humans causing fatal infections, and the current SOIV vaccine might no longer be sufficient to protect against the reassorted virus. In such a case, we can only rely on effective antiviral drugs. Today, neuraminidaseinhibitors, such as oseltamivir, represent the most common clinically approved medication against influenza A viruses. Unfortunately, the frequency of reports describing the appearance of drug-resistant seasonal H1N1 and also H5N1 influenza A viruses dramatically increased in the recent past. [1] [2] [3] [4] Drug resistance to the known antivirals highlights the urgent need for alternative antiviral compounds with novel defense mechanisms. Recently, we have reported that a polyphenol rich plant extract, CYSTUS052, which showed antiviral activity against influenza A viruses in cell culture and in mice. 5, 6 Moreover, the antiviral activity of CY-STUS052 against seasonal influenza virus and common colds was also demonstrated in humans. 7 However, the efficiency of CYSTUS052 against SOIV and A \u2044 H5N1 isolates was unknown so far. Therefore, we investigated CY-STUS052 effectiveness against the pandemic strain and seven natural influenza A \u2044 H5N1 isolates detected in several avian species during 2006 \u2044 2007 avian influenza outbreak. Additionally, the potency of the most common neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir was also investigated against these isolates. Here, we show that CYSTUS052 treatment was effective in in vitro studies against SOIV and A \u2044 H5N1 influenza virus.",

CYSTUS052 showed efficient antiviral activity against the pandemic H1N1v strain and was effective to a wide range of H5N1 viruses. Furthermore, CYSTUS052 demonstrated a broader and more efficient antiviral potential than oseltamivir. CYSTUS052 treatment leads to a stronger reduction of progeny virus titers, and more importantly, CYSTUS052 was effective against all tested viruses, while oseltamivir was unresponsive against two of seven A \u2044 H5N1 viruses. Even though the pandemic strain in general is still sensitive to oseltamivir treatment, there are increasing numbers of reports of emerging resistant variants. The treatment with CYSTUS052 does not result in the emergence of viral drug resistance since the mode of action is an unspecific physical binding of the virus particle that is also beneficial to reduce opportunistic bacterial infections. 5,7,10 CYSTUS052 is an extract from a special variety of the plant Cistus incanus, and it is very rich in polymeric polyphenols. 11 It is well known that polyphenols exhibit protein-binding capacity. 12 However, CYSTUS052 exhibited no neuraminidase inhibiting activity. Therefore, ingredients of CYSTUS052 may act in a rather unspecific physical manner by interfering with the viral hemagglutinin at the surface of the virus particle as demonstrated before. 5 While this prevents binding of the virion to cellular receptors, it does not block accessibility and action of the viral neuraminidase. Since, infections with influenza A viruses are still a major health burden and the options for control and treatment of the disease are limited, plant extracts such as CYSTUS052 should be considered as a new candidate drug for a save prophylactic and therapeutic use against influenza viruses.

The levels of virus-specific sIgA in NWs and bronchoalveolar fluids (BALF) and IgG in plasma were measured by ELISA as reported previously. 5 A retrospective clinical study was conducted. For the study, 40 children with acute influenza were recruited and grouped according to the treatment received: 5 days treatment with OSV (n = 14), CAM (n = 8), OSV + CAM (n = 12), and untreated (n = 6). Since parents in Japan are well aware of the adverse effects of OSV especially the neuropsychiatric complications, 6 the decision on whether to administer OSV or not and to prescribe CAM was made by the parents and the attending paediatricians, based on their anti-viral and immuno-modulatory activity. 3, 6 Comparisons were made of the levels of sIgA against IAV \u2044 H3N2 and IAV \u2044 H1N1, total sIgA, in NWs and disease symptoms before and after treatment. Anti-HA sIgA and total sIgA in NWs of patients were determined from the standard regression curves with human IgA of known concentration in a human IgA quantitation kit (Bethy Laboratories). Because an affinity purified human anti-HA-specific sIgA standard of each influenza A subtype is not available, the relative value of anti-HAspecific sIgA amount was expressed as unit (U). One unit was defined as the amount of one lg of human IgA detected in the assay system as reported previously. 6 The concentrations of sIgA in individual NWs were normalized by the levels of total sIgA (lg \u2044 ml).",

To investigate the influence of daily treatment with OSV on HA-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses, we analyzed HA-specific sIgA levels in NWs and BALF as well as IgG levels in plasma at days 8 and 12 post-infection in mice treated orally with OSV or methylcellulose (MC) as vehicle. The OSV treated mice showed lower antibody responses in NWs and BALF than control mice treated with MC solution (Table 1) . Significantly reduced HA-specific sIgA responses were particularly noted in the OSV group at day 12, the period of maximal mucosal sIgA induction. The airway secretions and plasma from mice at day 0 did not contain detectable levels of HA-specific antibodies. These findings were supported by other data whereby mice treated with OSV displayed significantly lower numbers of HA-specific IgA antibody-forming cells (AFCs) in the nasal lamina propria, mediastinal lymph nodes, and lungs compared with MC-treated mice. These results clearly indicate that oral administration of OSV downregulates HA-specific sIgA responses in mucosa. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the elevated levels of HA-specific plasma IgA and IgG antibodies or the increased numbers of HA-specific IgA and IgG AFCs in the spleen between OSV-and MC-treated mice. Taken together, these results implicated the oral administration of OSV in a suppressed induction of HAspecific sIgA responses in respiratory lymphoid tissues, although systemic HA-specific antibody responses were not significantly affected by OSV.",

The concentration ratio of Table 1 . anti-HA-specific sIgA to total sIgA in NWs was expressed as titer: anti-HA-specific sIgA (U \u2044 mg) \u2044 total sIgA (lg \u2044 mg) \u00b7 100. Figure 1 shows changes in the anti-HA(H3N2) sIgA ratio (titer) and fold of increase in sIgA titer in each patient during the 5-days' treatment for the four different treatment groups. It is noteworthy that, upon admission to the hospital, the sIgA titers were <3 in 93% of patients. During the 5 days of treatment, rapid increases in the titers were observed in almost all patients in CAM, OSV + CAM, and no treatment groups. In contrast, in the OSV group, the anti-HA-specific sIgA titers remained unchanged or decreased in the majority of patients. The finding of significant low induction of anti-viral sIgA in the OSV group was supported by the results of animal experiments. However, the addition of CAM to OSV augmented sIgA production and restored mucosal sIgA levels; 75% of patients treated with OSV + CAM showed >5-fold increase in the titers during treatment. These observations suggest that CAM stimulated the local mucosal immunoresponse in the nasopharyngeal region of patients treated with OSV.",

The development of new molecules that have a broad antiviral activity and are not subjected to influenza mutation is of particular interest. Our laboratory and others recently showed that proteases can participate to the innate immune response in the airways through the activation of a family of receptors called PAR. In particular, through the release of interferon, PAR2 agonists curbed viral replication significantly in infected cells. In this study, since ERK activation is crucial for virus replication, we investigated whether PAR2 could inhibit virus replication through inhibition of the ERK pathway. Results showed that while influenza A infection alone or PAR2 stimulation alone induced ERK activation, PAR2 stimulation does not inhibit ERK activation in influenza infected cells. Thus, PAR2 agonists may be a potential new drug against influenza viruses that could be used in combination with other anti flu therapy such as the inhibition of the ERK pathway.",

These receptors are highly expressed at epithelial surfaces, in particular in the lung, where human influenza virus replicate in vivo. PARs are thus directly exposed to proteases present in the airways. Among the four different PARs, PAR2 acts as an antiviral through an interferondependent pathway. 4, 5 Thus, agonists of PAR2 are potential new drugs against a broad range of influenza viruses, which is in accordance with the broad antiviral action of interferon. However, the signalling pathway induced by PAR2 agonists in influenza A infected cells has still to be investigated. In this manuscript, we showed that influenza infection or activation of PAR2 induced ERK activation, a crucial step for efficient virus replication. 6, 7 However, PAR2 agonists do not impaired ERK activation in influenza A virus infected cells. Since the pathway of PAR2 protection is likely to be ERK-independent, the use of anti ERK molecules in combination with PAR2 agonists maybe of potential interest in future anti-influenza therapy.",

Results showed that ERK was phosphorylated after influenza infection in a time course depen-dent manner when compared to uninfected cells. In contrast, ERK phosphorylation was not observed with heatinactivated viruses, suggesting that productive infection is needed for ERK activation ( Figure 1A ). Antibodies against ERK1 \u2044 2 were used as controls. Since ERK is activated after influenza infection, we then tested whether activation of PAR2 in uninfected cells also leads to activation of this pathway. For this purpose, A549 cells were stimulated with the selective human (H) or mouse (M) PAR2 agonist or a control peptide for the indicated time ( Figure 1B ). When exposed to the PAR2 agonists and compared to controltreated cells, ERK phosphorylation increased over the time course of stimulation. Thus, influenza infection or stimulation of PAR2 without infection in A549 cells induced activation of the ERK pathway at different time point post-infection.",

In addition to the cleavage of HA, necessary for IAV replication, extracellular proteases also play a role in the modulation of the immune system against influenza viruses through the activation of PARs. Particularly PAR2, activated by extracellular trypsin-like proteases, could inhibit virus replication through the release of interferon, 4,5 thus, strengthening the immune system via agonist peptides and providing new therapeutic potential against a broad range of influenza strains. In addition, targeting the host instead of the virus could provide a way to escape from virus resistance. 14 Thus, a better understanding of how virus escapes from immune surveillance may provide new therapeutic strategies to block IAV. In addition, combinations of drugs that block virus replication via different pathways are of interest. The non classical molecules HLA-G maybe an interesting new target as we recently showed that it is upregulated after influenza infection, 13 and it is a well known immunotolerant molecule. 15 Indeed, it inhibits the innate immune response 16 as well as the adaptive immune response. 17, 18 Also, as previously suggested, the ERK signal transduction cascade is also of potential interest since it is crucial for virus replication and particularly influenza replication. 6, 7 As shown here, it is unlikely that PAR2 protection occurs through an ERKdependent pathway. Thus strengthening the immune response with PAR2 agonists and blocking nuclear retention of the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes with inhibitors of the MEK \u2044 ERK pathway may be alternative combinatory approaches for influenza therapy. In addition, since those potential drugs target the host instead of the virus, this could help in the design of new antivirals molecules more resilient to IAV mutations and thus to virus resistance.",

In June 2009, vaccine companies estimated they could produce in 6 months almost 2.5 billion doses of pandemic vaccine. 1 Instead, they actually produced only 534 million doses, of which 64% were non adjuvanted preparations. Had these doses been produced with adjuvants (i.e., 3.75 lg instead of 15 lg HA per dose), an additional 1 billion doses could have been made available. Yet there was public opposition to adjuvants in many countries, especially by regulatory officials in the United States. Misperceptions about the safety of both adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted vaccines were widespread. Added to this, shortfalls in vaccine production, delays in vaccine delivery, and the ''mildness'' of the pandemic itself meant that only a few countries achieved reasonable levels of vaccine coverage. Millions of doses went unused and had to be destroyed. Supplies of antiviral agents were even more limited. Thus, despite the best efforts of influenza scientists, health officials, and companies, more than 90% of the world's people did not have timely access to affordable supplies of vaccines and antiviral agents. Instead, they had to rely on 19th century public health ''technologies.'' Given current understanding of biology in the early 21st century, they should have had -and probably could have had -something better.",

Ever since, influenza virologists have sought to answer the question ''why did young adults die?'' by defining the molecular characteristics of the 1918 virus that were responsible for its virulence. 8 In doing so, they have overlooked a crucial piece of clinical evidence from the 1918 pandemic: compared with young adults, children were infected more frequently with the same virus, yet they seldom died. Consequently, the more important question is ''why did children live?'' This can only be explained by recognizing that children must have had a different host response to the 1918 influenza virus than adults. Physicians have long recognized that for several other medical conditions, both infectious (e.g., pneumococcal bacteremia) and non-infectious (e.g., multiple trauma), children have a more benign clinical course than adults. 6, 8 A corollary of this observation is that secondary bacterial pneumonia, although commonly found in young adults in 1918, could not have been the primary cause of death. Children must have had the same or higher rates of nasopharyngeal colonization with the same bacteria that were associated with pneumonia deaths in adults, yet children seldom died of secondary bacterial pneumonia. 6 If young adults died with secondary bacterial pneumonia, underlying host factors must have made them more susceptible.",

Regardless of age, people with all of these conditions share one characteristic in common: they have chronic low-grade inflammation. In effect, their ''innate immune rheostats'' have been set at different, and perhaps more precarious, levels that make them more vulnerable to influenza-related complications. 10 Laboratory studies of influenza virus infection confirm the importance of the host response. In several studies in mice in which the host response has been modified (e.g., cytokine knockout), survival has been improved without increasing virus replication in the lung. 5 In fact, severe disease can be induced without any influenza virus replication. For example, fatal acute lung injury has been induced in mice by inactivated (not live) H5N1 virus. 11 In this model, antiviral agents would be useless; only the host response could be responsible for disease.",

The NF-kappaB-inhibitor SC75741 efficiently blocks H5N1 influenza virus propagation in vitro and in vivo without the tendency to induce resistant virus variants Introduction Influenza is still one of the major plagues worldwide. The appearance of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses in humans and the emergence of resistant H5N1 variants against neuraminidase inhibitors highlight the need for new and amply available antiviral drugs. We and others have demonstrated that influenza virus misuses the cellular IKK \u2044 NF-kappaB signalling pathway for efficient replication, suggesting that this module may be a suitable target for antiviral intervention. 1 Here, we show that the novel NF-kappaB inhibitor SC75741 efficiently blocks replication of influenza A viruses, including avian and human A \u2044 H5N1 isolates in vitro in concentrations that do not affect cell viability or metabolism. In a mouse infection model with HPAI A \u2044 H5N1 and A \u2044 H7N7 viruses, we were able to demonstrate reduced clinical symptoms and survival of SC75741 treated mice. Moreover, influenza virus was reduced in the lung of drug-treated animals. Besides this direct antiviral effect, the drug also suppresses H5N1-induced overproduction of cytokines and chemokines in the lung, suggesting that it might prevent hypercytokinemia we hypothesise to be associated with pathogenesis after infections with highly pathogenic influenza viruses, such as the A \u2044 H5N1 strains. Thus, a SC75741-based drug may serve as a broadly active nontoxic anti-influenza agent. ",

As shown in Figure 2B the amount of IL-6 specific mRNA was drastically reduced in SC75741 treated mice compared to solvent treated controls. Moreover, also the expression of IP-10 was altered in SC75741 treated H5N1 influenza virus infected mice. Here, roughly 90% reduction of specific mRNA was detectable ( Figure 2C ).

Thus, drug safety has to be rigorously tested in clinical trials regardless whether a drug targets a cellular or a viral factor. Moreover, resistance against human H1N1 influenza viruses and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus strains to oseltamivir and amantadine have been reported. 5 In that respect, the strategy to target cellular factors 6,7 might be one way to ensure that new drugs against influenza virus will be useful and effective for a long time without causing the development of resistant virus variants.",

One Cantonese-speaking adult (age \u202118) was invited for interview in each selected household on the basis of a Kish grid. The survey instrument was based on previous experience in SARS and avian influenza projects. Information, including knowledge on modes of transmission, psychological responses to pandemic influenza, preventive behaviors, attitudes towards the new vaccines and socio-demographics, was collected. Informed consent was obtained prior to the interview. Ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong. Descriptive statistics were weighted by sex and age based on the reference population data provided by the Hong Kong Government Census and Statistics Department. 12 Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between the use of preventive measures and knowledge, perceptions and behaviors, sociodemographic characteristics, and psychological responses to pandemic influenza. Multiple imputation was used to cope with a small proportion of missing data and make the best use of all available data. 13 Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 2.9.1 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria).",

As pH1N1 spread in Hong Kong, risk perception declined, even at the same time as incidence was increasing. Anxiety was low throughout, at around 1.8 on the 4-point scale, compared to a maximum of 2.5 during SARS on the same scale. 9 Anxiety has been showed to be positively correlated to personal hygiene measures and social distancing in previous studies; 9,14 however, we found a negative correlation between anxiety and use of all hand hygiene measures, cough etiquette, and face masks, and a positive correlation between anxiety and home disinfection. 11 The differences in findings may be due to the fact that our anxiety measure was not specific to H1N1, and the score could be affected by other factors including economics. Unlike hygiene measures, higher anxiety level, greater worry, and higher risk of perception were all associated with more social distancing. 6, 7, 9, 14 Social distancing is the most direct strategy in avoiding infection from other people, and it is commonly observed in an outbreak that the general public avoids crowded places, travelling to other countries, and social gatherings, 9, 14 but the economic impact could be substantial. 15 As community incidence of H1N1 peaked, we did not observe any increase in use of preventive measures (Figure 2) . We found that face mask use peaked at the early stage of the pandemic, while hand hygiene remained fairly constant, and the knowledge on the modes of transmission of pH1N1 did not improve over time. The lack of substantial change in preventive measures or knowledge about the modes of pH1N1 transmission in the general population suggests that community mitigation measures played little role in mitigating the impact of pH1N1 in Hong Kong. On the other hand, knowledge that pH1N1 could be spread by indirect contact was associated with all of the preventive measures studied. Consistent with reports during the SARS period, 9, 16 this study also showed that females and those of older age were more likely than others to use hygiene measures, avoid crowded places, and reschedule travel plans.",

Implementation of the identified research priorities is expected to underpin public health decision-making at all levels with proven knowledge that will help to save large numbers of lives, reduce health costs, and economic loss and mitigate potential social disruption over a medium-tolong term period. The impacts of school resumption on the incidence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in school students Introduction School closure is one non-pharmaceutical intervention that is often suggested in pandemic preparedness plans, and it was widely implemented in Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 to reduce transmission amongst school students. However, from past epidemiological studies, the effect of school closure in reducing respiratory disease transmission was inconclusive. 1 Given this public health intervention causes major disruption to the education system and potentially raises childcare issues to working parents, evaluating its effect in the recent pandemic is necessary to improve future pandemic planning. In Hong Kong, since school closure was implemented early in the pandemic and closure was effectively continued with the commencement of summer holiday, the lack of incidence data in the absence of school closure makes it difficult to analyse its effect directly. This has prompted us to analyse the situation indirectly from the angle of school resumption after summer holiday.",

Demographics of reported cases were subsequently recorded into a computerised system (the ''e-flu'' database). Following institutional approval, a dataset of all confirmed cases diagnosed from May to September 2009 was obtained, which included the age, gender, confirmation date, and notification date of each report.

Previously, we demonstrated that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and p38 MAP kinase (p38) signaling pathways separately contribute to the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in H5N1-infected cells. 2 Here we investigate the role of innate sensing receptors in the induction of these cytokines and chemokines in response to H5N1 and seasonal H1N1 infection. Materials and methods: Human macrophages derived from peripheral blood monocytes were infected with H5N1 (483 \u2044 97) or seasonal H1N1 (54 \u2044 98) viruses. The role of innate sensing receptors in cytokine and chemokine induction by H5N1 virus was investigated using transient knock-down of these receptors with siRNAs. The expression of innate sensing receptors in infected cells, and as a result of paracrine activation (by virus free supernatants of infected cells) of adjacent uninfected cells were also monitored by real-time PCR and \u2044 or Western Blotting. The involvement of Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathways in these autocrine \u2044 paracrine cascades was investigated using a JAK inhibitor. Results: We previously showed that TNF-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-lambda 1 are the key mediators directly induced by the H5N1 virus in primary human macrophages with other cytokines and chemokines being induced as part of a secondary autocrine and paracrine cascade. Here we demonstrated that retinoicacid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) rather than Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) plays the predominant role in H5N1-induced cytokines and chemokines in human macrophages via the regulation of IRF3 and NF-kB nuclear translocation. In addition to the effects on virus infected cells, paracrine interactions between macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells contributed to cytokine cascades via modulation of JAK signaling and by the upregulation of sensing receptors. Conclusions: H5N1 directly induced TNF-alpha and IFNbeta mainly via RIG-I signaling, and the subsequent activa-tion and nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-kB in human macrophages. In addition to the effects on cytokine signaling, the innate immune sensing regulators themselves were also up-regulated by H5N1 infection, much more so than by seasonal influenza infection, via JAK signaling. The up-regulation of innate sensing receptors was not limited to the infected cells, but was also found in adjacent uninfected cells through paracrine feedback mechanisms. This may lead to broadened and amplified cytokine signals within the microenvironment of the infected lung. A more precise understanding of the signaling pathways triggered by H5N1 virus leading to cytokine induction may provide novel options for the design of therapeutic strategies for severe human H5N1 influenza and also for treating other causes of acute respiratory disease syndrome.",

Cytokine dysregulation has been suggested to contribute to the disease severity of H5N1 (Reviewed in 1 ). However, signaling pathways involved in the cytokine induction by H5N1 virus are not fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that IRF3 and p38 MAP kinase (p38) are separate signaling pathways which contribute to the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in H5N1-infected cells. 2 RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) are important cytosolic sensors of nucleic acid of pathogens, while TLR3 and TLR8 also recognize nucleic acid species of pathogens, but they are localized at the endosomal membrane. 3 RIG-I was found to be responsible for the recognition of influenza A virus infection, 4 and the transfection of vRNPs induces IFN-beta expression. 5 While many studies have shown the role of RIG-I in the induction of IFN-beta by influenza virus infection, the majority of these studies used either immortalized cell lines or mouse embryonic fibroblasts. There is a lack of data on the role of these innate sensing receptors in highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 infection in primary human cells in vitro, which are more physiologically relevant. Furthermore, there is little data on the autocrine and paracrine up-regulation of these innate immune sensors following virus infection.",

As shown in Figure 1A , 483 \u2044 97 virus induced higher level of IFN-beta mRNA expression than 54 \u2044 98 infection. Cells transfected with RIG-I or TLR3 siRNA significantly reduced the expression of IFN-beta after 483 \u2044 97 infection, by 63% and 29%, respectively. RIG-I silencing also significantly reduced the IFN-beta expression in 54 \u2044 98 infected cells by 52%. In contrast, silencing of MDA5 or TLR8 did not suppress the induction of IFN-beta by either 54 \u2044 98 or 483 \u2044 97 infection; in fact, there was a slight (15%) increase of IFN-beta in cells transfected with MDA5 siRNA.

The percentages of cells with nuclear translocation were plotted in Figure 1B .

One chicken inoculated with rgVac1sub-P2 (H5N1) showed clinical signs such as depression, and viruses were recovered from virtually all of its organs and blood samples. Two of three chickens inoculated with rgVac1ins-P2 (H5N1) showed disease signs, and one died 2 days post inoculation. The viruses were recovered from almost all samples of the two chickens showing signs of disease. P3 viruses were efficiently replicated in systemic organs of the chickens as compared with P2 viruses.

However, chickens intranasally inoculated with rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2) did not show any clinical signs of disease (data not shown). These results are consistent with a previous study in chickens that found some H10 influenza viruses did not show intranasal pathogenicity although their intravenous pathogenicity index was over 1AE2, classified as HPAIV according to the definition by European Union. 11 Ohuchi et al. 12 reported that the insertion of additional basic amino acids into the H3 HA cleavage site resulted in intracellular proteolytic cleavage. Other groups reported that H3 and H6 HAs tolerated amino acid mutations into their cleavage sites, and the viruses with the mutated HAs replicated in MDCK and \u2044 or QT6 cells in the absence of trypsin. 13, 14 The results in the present study is in agreement with these, namely, cleavage-based activation by a ubiquitous protease is not restricted to the H5 and H7 HAs.",

The viruses were recovered from the brain and the blood of some chickens infected with rgVac1 mutants (H5N1), and morbidity was closely associated with viral titers in the brain (Table 2) . On the other hand, no viruses were recovered from the brain of chickens infected with rgY55 mutants (H9N2), explaining why rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2) did not show intranasal pathogenicity. All the viruses passaged in the air sacs of chicks killed chicken embryos by 48 hours post allantoic inoculation (data not shown). rgVac1sub-P3 (H5N1) and rgVac1ins-P3 (H5N1) were more pathogenic to chicken embryos than rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2); the allantoic fluid obtained from the embryonated eggs inoculated with the H5 viruses passaged in air sacs was turbid. It has been reported that infection of a highly pathogenic H7 virus were strictly confined to endotherial cells in chicken embryos or chickens. 15, 16 Therefore, it is suggested that endotheliotropism differed between the H9 and H5 viruses passaged in air sacs and affected their intranasal pathogenicity. Taken together, it is assumed that rgVac1sub-P3 (H5N1) and rgVac1ins-P3 (H5N1) showed marked intranasal pathogenicity with high levels of viremia caused by replication in vascular endothelial cells, leading to invasion of the brain. In the intravenous experiment, rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2) easily reached systemic organs, including the brain hematogenously, replicated through the cleavage of HA by a ubiquitous protease, and then exerted its pathogenicity. Further study including a pathological analysis is currently underway to test this hypothesis.",

Early studies demonstrated that the ubiquitously expressed furin and PCs are activating proteases of HPAI viruses. 1 Furin and PCs cleave the consensus multi-basic motif R-X-K \u2044 R \u2044 X-R with R at position P4. 2 However, replacement of P4 R by K and a nonbasic amino acid significantly suppresses the processing activities of furin and PCs. 2 Most of the type II transmembrane serine protease identified so far recognize a single R at position P1, but the newly isolated MSPL and its transcript variant TMPRSS13 preferentially recognize paired basic residue, particularly R and K at position P4, at the cleavage site. [3] [4] [5] Thus, MSPL and TMPRSS13 can activate various bioactive polypeptides with multibasic residue motifs, including fusogenic viral envelope glycoproteins.

After incubation with human MSPL or human furin, the digested samples were separated by RP-HPLC, and peptide fragments were characterized by mass-spectrometry and protein sequencing. In contrast to the low cleavage efficiencies of the H3 HA peptide with a single R at the cleavage site ( Figure 1A) , both the H5 HA peptide with the K-K-K-R motif ( Figure 1B ) and the H7 HA peptide with the R-K-K-R motif ( Figure 1C) were fully processed at the correct positions by MSPL within 1 hour. In the case of H7 HA peptide with multiple basic residues, MSPL cleaved two carboxyl-terminal sides of R in the cleavage site sequence of N'-K-K-Rfl-K-K-Rfl-G-C', while furin cleaved only at a single site of R with R at position P4, N'-K-K-R-K-K-Rfl-G-C' in the presence of 1 mm CaCl 2 . These cleavage site specificities of furin were consistent with that reported for the H5 HA peptide of HPAI virus A \u2044 Hong Kong \u2044 156 \u2044 97 (H5N1) with R-K-K-R motif. 1 However, the H5 HA peptide with K at position P4 ( Figure 1B) was hardly cleaved by furin under the same experimental conditions.

These findings suggest that MSPL has diverse cleavage specificities and may cleave HA at least two sites, although multiplicity of the mutant HPAI virus was observed under the conditions. These results also suggest that MSPL and TMPRSS13 in the membrane might potently activate the HA membrane fusion activity of HPAI viruses and promote their spread.",

PB1-F2 proteins from a variety of epidemiologically important IAV strains including all pandemic strains from the 20th century, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5N1 subtype, and representative seasonal strains were utilized to determine the relevance to pandemic disease.

Mice were exposed to a panel of peptides and were euthanized 24 hours later for collection of BALF. Significant influxes of macrophages into the BALF were seen following exposure to C-terminal PB1-F2 peptides derived from PR8, the pandemic strains from 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2), and the 2004 H5N1 virus compared to controls ( Figure 1B) .

When peptide exposed mice were followed for morbidity for 7 days, peptides proven to induce a heightened inflammatory response correlated strongly with overt clinical signs of illness (data not shown).

When RAW264.7 cells were infected with PR8 virus, necrotic death peaked 8 hours after infection. Viruses lacking the C-terminal portion of PB1-F2, including the DPB1-F2 \u2044 PR8 and the Beij PB1-F2 \u2044 PR8 were unable to cause cell death ( Figure 1C ). In addition, expression of the 1918 PB1-F2 also did not cause significant increases in cell death over controls. Expression of PB1-F2 or deletion of PB1-F2 in either an H3N2 or H5N1 PB1 gene segment background similarly did not alter the cell death phenotype.",

Disease burden from this strain has been considered mild 10 in contrast to the three pandemics of the 20th century. 11 The reasons for this disparity in pathogenesis are unclear. An examination of the origins of the three 20th century pandemics shows that only 2 the hemagglutinin (HA) and PB1 gene segments were reassorted directly from the avian reservoir in every case, suggesting gene products of one or both of these may be important. 12 The HA surface glycoprotein provided the antigenic novelty required for the each virus to achieve pandemic status. However, the significance of inclusion of a novel PB1 gene segment in each of the 20th century pandemics is not yet understood. We show here that the PB1-F2 of these pandemic strains contributes to virulence through induction of inflammatory responses. Thus PB1-F2 may serve as a marker of the pathogenicity of pandemic strains. Since the 2009 H1N1 strain codes a truncated PB1-F2 of only 11 predicted amino acids, the lack of PB1-F2 mediated inflammation may account in part for its relatively lower virulence. 13, 14 Of the panel of PB1-F2 proteins studied, only that from the laboratory strain PR8 was capable of rendering responding host-immune cells ineffective by induction of cell death. We therefore hypothesize that molecular signatures specific to induction of apoptosis may have been lost through genetic mutation of the PB1-F2 gene throughout the evolution of the IAVs. Our findings suggest that this apoptotic function is unlikely to be important for the virulence of any of the known pandemics. Rather, the inflammatory phenotype appears to be the dominant contribution of PB1-F2 to pandemic disease.",

Since these cytokine responses are associated with activation of NF-jB and AP-1, we treated mice once daily for 4 days with anti-oxidant inhibitors: PDTC and NAC against NF-jB activation, and NDGA against AP-1 activation. PDTC and NDGA significantly suppressed the up-regulation of TNF-a and IL-1b (P < 0.001), and NAC suppressed TNF-a (P < 0.001), and IL-6 (P < 0.01) at day 4 post-infection. Gelatin zymography showed up-regulation of ectopic trypsin and MMP-9 in mice lung, brain, and heart during infection for 4 days ( Figure 2B ). Trypsin and MMP-9 induction was inhibited by treatment with PDTC, NAC, and NDGA, probably via blockade of NF-jB and AP-1 binding in the promoter region of the genes. Viral RNA replication in various organs at day 4 post-infection was suppressed by more than one order of magnitude by PDTC, NAC, and NDGA ( Figure 2C ). Suppression of viral multiplication and induction of cellular factors by PDTC, NAC, and NDGA, significantly improved the survival of mice at day 14 post-infection, the late stage of infection ( Figure 2D ). To elucidate the mechanisms underlying brain vascular dysfunction of influenza-associated encephalopathy, changes in the levels of tight-junction proteins, intracellular zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and transmembrane occludin, and the matrix protein laminin, were analyzed by western blotting. Marked reductions in the expression levels of tight-junction constituents were detected at day 4 post-infection, which were partly rescued by PDTC, NAC, or NDGA (Figure 2E ). 9 No other tight-junction protein, claudin-5 or matrix fibronectin and type IV collagen, were affected.",

Based on these results, we propose the 'influenza virus-cytokine-protease cycle' hypothesis as one of the mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in MOF with cytokine storm in severe influenza and influenza-associated encephalopathy. 9 The significance of pro-inflammatory hyper-cytokinemia, or 'cytokine storm,' in the pathogenesis of IAV infection remains unclear. On the positive effects, cytokines promote lymphocyte activation and infiltration at the sites of infection and exert direct antiviral effects. However, on the negative effects of excess cytokines, the hyper inflammatory process evoked by viral infection may become harmful through intracellular activation of NF-jB, AP-1, and the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling pathways. 3, [10] [11] [12] The in vivo experiments presented here showed that NF-jB and AP-1 inhibitors markedly suppress the expression of cytokines, trypsin, MMP-9, and viral replication, resulting in a significant increase in the survival of infected mice. Furthermore, cytokines interact with mitochondria to increase the production of reactive oxygen species, resulting in the production \u2044 activation of vasodilatory mediators such as nitric oxide and bradykinin, and subsequent endothelial dysfunction and edema in various organs. 3 The molecular mechanisms underlying tight-junction disruption in endothelial cells and vascular hyper-permeability following the 'cytokine storm' remain unclear. TNFa up-regulation alters the cellular redox state, reduces the expression of four complex I subunits by increasing mitochondrial O 2 ) production and depleting ATP synthesis, decreases oxygen consumption thereby resulting in mitochondrial damage, 3, 13 and increases [Ca 2+ ] i 14 ATP depletion dissociates ZO-1 from the actin cytoskeleton and thereby increases junctional permeability. 15 Endothelial dysfunction induced by 'influenza virus-cytokine-protease cycle' in the early stage of severe influenza may further affect various circulating factors, coagulation factors and complement systems, and vascular interacting cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. MOF is the final outcome of metabolic and mitochondrial fuel disorder, immunosuppression, endocrine disorder, and tissue injury followed by endothelial dysfunction in many organs. Another key pathway of acute lung injury in the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1and acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus infection reported recently involves oxidative stress and formation of oxidized phospholipids, which induce lung injury via Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway. 16 In addition to these data, up-regulated trypsin and pro-inflammatory cytokines may also affect tissue destruction and immunosuppression in the late stage of IAV infection. Further studies are required on the role of the 'influenza virus-cytokine-protease cycle' in the pathogenesis of MOF, particularly in the late stage of viral infection.",

Interestingly, a ferret study of pathogenesis observed that swine flu yields from the upper respiratory tract were greater than those given by ordinary seasonal H1N1, with consequently increased shedding. 8 The review by Mansfield 9 cites significant findings regarding influenza pathogenesis, including the predilection of H5N1 strains for type II pneumocyte cells and alveolar macrophages. It also highlights the limitation of knowledge through dearth of human autopsy studies; an exception is the recognition of haematophagocytic syndrome in severe cases. It is known that specific immunoglobulin is effective against establishment of infection in the upper respiratory tract, whereas specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are necessary for clearance of the virus from the lower respiratory tract. 10 It is also suggestive that a gap of two whole days transpires between initial infection and instigation of a specific immune response. 11 It is plausible that in the healthy individual, virus progression is confounded by efficient natural mucosal immunity, in part through good secretory immunoglobulin levels.",

This mutation is referred in the literature as being associated with the putative antigenic site Ca. 4 Most of these strains (19) further subgroup in the D222E branch, this mutation being associated with one loop of the receptor-binding site. 1 From the early to the late epidemic period, an increased circulation of virus carrying the mutation S203T was observed. This is in agreement with the association between this mutation and an enhanced viral fitness that is described in the literature. 5 Additional mutations were also observed in a small number of virus, of which we highlight: Regarding the genetic characterisation of NA, the majority of strains analysed (34 of 37) presents the mutations N248D and V106I ( Figure 1B) . As mutation S203T in HA gene, these two NA mutations are described in the literature as associated with enhanced viral fitness. 5 The few strains not carrying these mutations have circulated in the beginning of the epidemic period.

The pandemic wave lasted 11 weeks between mid-October and the end of December (week 43 to week 53, Figure 1 ). The pandemic wave started week 42-43 in the Ile-de-France area, and only week 44-45 in the rest of France. The peak was recorded week 48 ( Figure 1 ). The impact of the pandemic was mainly observed in the 5-15 years group of age. Overall, 1334 severe cases have been admitted to the hospital, and 308 deaths have been recorded by the end of the pandemic wave. The major impact was observed in the 15-65 years group of age (66% of deaths recorded). Amongst the severe cases and the deceased cases, 20% and 16% of cases had no risk factor, respectively. these specimens, 24 279 were positives for H1N1, representing 99AE7% of total influenza virus detections. Only nine Brisbane-like H1N1, 62 Brisbane-like H3N2, and eight B viruses have been detected in the same period of time. The weekly positive rate ranged from 0% to 48%. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of the viruses collected during the pandemic wave did not show any emerging genetic or antigenic variants (Figure 2A,B) . Eight patients, all among cases presenting with severe illness, were infected by a virus harbouring the D222G mutation in the HA. 2 Amongst the virus tested for antiviral susceptibility or screened for the H275Y mutation by or specific RT-PCR, only 11 oseltamivir-resistant viruses related to the NA H275Y mutation have been detected. One of these cases also had an I223R mutation associated to a reduced sensitivity to zanamivir. All but one resistant virus were detected in treated immunocompromised patients. Overall, eight patients presented a virus with the D222G mutation in the HA. All these patients had a severe infection; one of these had also a H275Y mutation in the NA asociated to oseltamivir resistance.",

            "text": "The pandemic started by the end of April 2009. Although the first cases recorded were as early as the 28th of April, the epidemic wave associated with a widespread spread of the virus was only recorded in October. The french population did not have to face a summer wave, as observed in North America and in numerous European countries. 3, 4 It is difficult to speculate the reasons for the lack of summer wave; the specimens collected were negative for influenza. Moreover, during September, it was anticipated that school openings would be the trigger for the beginning of the pandemic wave. As a matter of fact, a significant increase of influenza-like syndromes were observed at that time, but the virological investigation carried out by the laboratories showed thta is was related to a very large epidemic of rhinovirus. 5 The epidemic circulation of other respiratory viruses can be counfounding factors for the surveillance of the influenza epidemic clinical when the survellance is only based on collection of clinical information. The starting of the pandemic wave was heterogeneous in France. The Ilede-France region (Paris and its suburbean area), where the population is dense, experienced an early start as compared to the rest of France. However, once the pandemic started in the rest of the county, the epidemic curves were quite similar. The peak was reached at identical times, although it may have been delayed in some remote places in France. Overall, we estimate that 10% of the French population consulted for an ILI presentation. The impact was mainly observed in the 5-15 years groupe of. However, this age groupe represented only a limited number of severe cases and deaths. On the other hand, the 15-65 years groupe of age, where the prevalence was not high, was the age group where the majority of severe cases and deaths was recorded (74% and 66%, respectively). 6 This data is consistent with the observational data reported by numerous other countries. 7 According to the profile of hospitalized cases, A(H1N1)2009 was more aggressive than seasonal viruses. The number of admission to the hospital was ten-fold that observed during a normal influenza epidemic. Even if the mortality was limited (312 cases), the age distribution of the deceased patients was different as compared to seasonal influenza (75% mortality in <65 years of age). The lack of recordeable excess mortality has been interpreted to be the consequence of a very mild pandemic, milder than some seasonal epidemics. However, the median age of the fatal cases was much younger than those observed during the seasonal flu, leading to a mis-interpretation of the real impact of the pandemic. When the impact is measurered in loss of years of life, the impact of this pandemic is larger than seen with seasonal influenza, and is quite comparable to these of the two last pandemics. 8 The pandemic preparadness of numerous countries, the develoment of new intensive care techniques and equipment, and the large use of antivirals have reduced the overall impact of this pandemic. These are new factors that should be taken into account when evaluating the real impact of the 2009 H1N1 virus. 8 The virological monitoring of the pandemic was achieved by the community-based and hospital-based sea- sonal influenza networks, reminding the importance of maintining such networks. The diagnosis of influenza in most of the patients was carried out by molecular techniques. It has been clearly stated from the beginning of the pandemic that near-patient tests were lacking of susceptibility and could not be used for patient management. The distribution of a set of validated and comprehensive techniques by the two NIC was very helpfull for the monitoring of the pandemic and the patients. However, this diagnostic procedure change should not preclude maintaining virus isolation that is necessary for whole genome analysis, monitoring of antigenic changes, and phenotypic testing for antiviral testing. Some of the mutants that have been recorded, including viruses with antiviral resistance phenotype or genotype, could be analysed from grown virus strains. It is striking that despite a large antiviral usage, only a limited number of isolates had mutations associated to resistance. However, the frequent isolation of such resistant virus was observed in immunocompromised patients that presented severe infections and long virus shedding. 9 The impact of the pandemic is still under evaluation. Sero-epidemiological analysis will be performed to asses for the real attack rate of the 2009 pandemic virus. As in other countries, it has been recorded that asymptomatic infections could be observed frequently. 10 It is quite unlikely that the impact of the pandemic was reduced by the vaccination campaign, although this vaccination started on the 12th of November, just when the pandemic started in France. It is estimated that 6 millions received the vaccination.",

Immediately, domestic and international public health agencies were forced to develop containment and mitiga-tion strategies in response to the pandemic. However, the dynamics and transmission patterns of this novel virus are yet to be fully understood. Simultaneously, seasonal strains of influenza (A \u2044 H1N1, A \u2044 H3N2, and B) continued to circulate in many nations.

The pattern differed from the observed pattern of viral shedding in seasonal influenza B infections. The majority of viral shedding in influenza A strains occurred at and near ARI onset, whereas there were variable amounts of viral shedding preand post-ARI onset for those with influenza B. The biological reason for this difference is yet to be clarified. These differences are consistently observed regardless of laboratory method used to quantify the viral loads. It was observed that viral shedding measured by TCID 50 resolved more quickly than when measured by RT-PCR, suggesting that RT-PCR is more sensitive, but it could be detecting inactivated fragments of RNA instead of active virus. The trends observed for the seasonal strains of influenza in this study were similar to those reported in literature. 2 The patterns of symptoms and signs as well as tympanic temperature in the four different strains of interest in this study were found to be comparable. These patterns closely resemble the patterns of viral shedding observed in the influenza A virus strains, but not in the influenza B virus strain. The trends of viral shedding, symptom scores, and tympanic temperature for pandemic A \u2044 H1N1 were similar to trends observed for seasonal A \u2044 H1N1 and seasonal A \u2044 H3N2 infections, suggesting that the dynamics of these viruses are largely the same.

This lack of power led to the inability to analyse the differences between adult and children and other characteristics that could be correlated with amount of viral shedding. There are also biases that must be factored in during recruitment. The eligibility criteria of only healthy households could select for households with higher innate immunity. On the other hand, recruitment at health care providers can be biased towards index cases that had more severe illness that required medical attention. The strength of the study is the broad generalizability of the results due to the strict classification of secondary cases. The infections reported in this study were all community-based and should represent true natural infections. ",

The ability to immunize with the LAIV and subsequently block the spread of a homologous H3N2 subtype and a heterologous H3N2 subtype influenza virus between guinea pigs has been shown. 3 Interference between cold-adapted and wildtype influenza virus infection was the most likely explanation for the data observed in our study. The MDV inoculated into guinea pigs might in some way interfere with transmission of highly transmissible influenza viruses. It is believed by some that widespread use of LAIV could increase the potential risk of reassortment of the vaccine strain with circulating influenza viruses immediately following vaccination. However, it was shown that any such potential reassortments would most likely lead to yet attenuated viruses. 4 Our in vivo studies have shown that introduction of MDV genes into the genome of NIB-RG-23 virus led to the generation of triple reassortants inherited PB2 and NA genes of MDV and HA gene of H5N1 virus. All isolates possessed phenotypical markers associated with attenuation of MDV. Our data suggest that even if a reassortment event of such rare occurrence between a LAIV strain and a circulating virus were to occur, it would most likely lead to a reassortant that would retain highly attenuated phenotypic properties of the vaccine strain.",

Instead, various forms of lung models that simulate human respiratory patterns with such particulate tracers have been used. 6, 7 Schlieren imaging is a technique familiar to engineers and offers a non-invasive (i.e., no tracer required) airflow visualization method that depends only on differences in the refractive index of the warmer, human-exhaled air and the cooler ambient air. 8 The use of a simple incandescent or light-emitting diode (i.e., non-laser) light source is safe and allows human volunteers to be used as experimental subjects, where their exhaled airflows are then observed using a large, precise spherical or parabolic telescopic mirror and a camera, and are recorded for later analysis and presentation.

A previous detailed study of one of these images measured a maximum airflow velocity of 8 m \u2044 second for an adult cough. 9 Similarly, the effects of wearing surgical and N95 masks can be generalized across different ages. Wearing a surgical mask allows leakage of the coughed air from the sides, top, and bottom of the mask ( Figure 2B ). There is also some leakage through the mask, as indicated by the darker patches of air directly in front of the mask ( Figure 2B, C) .",

This is often the case when N95-style masks are purchased and used by the general public -in contrast to the situation with healthcare workers, who are often accurately fit-tested for this type of mask. The immediate significance of this can be seen when masks are bought by parents for their children. Often, these will not be of pediatric size and the mask-fit will be loose. Children are well-known to be major sources of infection in the community because of their relatively poor immunity to many types of infectious agents due to their young age and, therefore, limited past-exposure history. 12 These images allow infection control teams to literally see how far and how fast potentially-infectious human exhaled airflows can travel from an individual. This may have significant implications for guidance on the wearing of masks for infected staff and patients, on ward bed-spacing, as well as for the types of masks to be used in different situations. The important practical potential lies in the non-intrusive visualization of airflows associated with human volunteers, to assist in heightening the awareness amongst healthcare workers of the risks and potential for the airborne transmission of infectious agents, as well as the development of more effective aerosol infection control policies.",

In our plaque assay, we inoculated A \u2044 Hong Kong \u2044 8 \u2044 68 virus dilutions into two different vessels with 2 hours adsorption time: 6-well plate and T-25 flask, 9 ml inoculum per replicate.

The discrepancy on virus potency can possibly be explained as: the binding of virus to host cell occurs only when virus gets a chance to interact with the cell on the monolayer during adsorption time. The percentage of virus population in the inoculum that has the opportunity to bind to the cell mainly depends on the surface area where this interaction takes place. Therefore, in our experiment the plaque assay in the T-25 flask gave higher virus recovery 2AE2 10 6 versus 1AE4 \u00b7 10 6 pfu \u2044 ml. The increased virus recovery can translate into better sensitivity of the test system for disinfectant and antiviral agents.

It is the most important agent in outbreaks of respiratory illness. 1 Influenza in aged care facilities (ACFs) is associated with an increased risk of poor health outcomes among residents, including death. 2 The clinical presentation of influenza in residents of ACFs can be subtle, with a blunted febrile response and a non-specific decline in mental and functional status. 3 Residents commonly have underlying diseases that can be exacerbated by influenza infection, and in addition, they are at higher risk of serious influenza-related complications than community dwelling elderly people. 4 People aged over 65 years are also at higher risk of influenza-related death, and more than 90% of annual influenza-related mortality is usually confined to this high risk group. 5 In Australia, influenza and pneumonia have sub-stantial health impacts; recorded as being the underlying causes of death for 2623 persons in 2007. 6 Since the World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic in June 2009, Australia has suffered one of the highest rates of confirmed infection during the first southern hemisphere wave. By late October 2009 there were 187 reported deaths due to pandemic influenza in Australia, 7 and to date there have been about 18 449 deaths reported worldwide. 8 Although disproportionately far fewer elderly people developed clinical influenza during the current pandemic than occurs with seasonal influenza, their case-fatality rate remained substantial. 9 Early in the pandemic (June 2009), we investigated a suspected pandemic influenza outbreak in a rural ACF in the state of NSW, Australia. The epidemiology (including virulence and clinical outcome in the elderly) of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was mostly unknown at the time of investigation, and as time passed, this investigation provided clarity on some important issues of the influenza epidemiology in the elderly population. In this paper we share our experience of managing a dual outbreak of viral respiratory infections early in the pandemic, and also describe some of the emerging issues relating to the cross-reacting antibodies to pandemic influenza in the very elderly.",

Rhinovirus infection, however, was confirmed by NAT in ten residents. This outbreak illustrates that more than one virus (in this case 2 and perhaps 3) may be circulating in an ACF at any one time in winter. In ILI outbreaks in ACFs, broad laboratory testing is recommended; NAT is the most sensitive method of detecting influenza or other viruses in respiratory tract samples. 13 Studies have found that the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 haemagglutinin (HA) gene is more closely related phylogenetically to the 1918 H1N1 virus and classical swine influenza A \u2044 H1N1 viruses than more recent seasonal human influenza A \u2044 H1N1 viruses. 14 It is antigenically similar to the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus in terms of the immunodominant antibody response to haemagglutinin. [15] [16] [17] It is likely that individuals alive during the emergence and initial persistence of the 1918 pandemic virus would have higher levels of cross-reacting HAI antibodies to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009, which would contribute towards better clinical protection. 18 In our investigation, 60% of the residents born before 1925 (aged 85 years or above in 2009) had pre-existing cross-reacting HAI antibody to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009.",

However, studies have shown that nursing home residents may be susceptible to outbreaks of rhinovirus that may cause mild to severe respiratory illness, particularly in those with a history of lung disease. One rhinovirus outbreak in a nursing home in the USA caused 12 fatalities. 19 Another outbreak showed residents with underlying lung disease are more likely to have longer infection, require antibiotics, develop bronchospasm, and have difficulty breathing; two residents with underlying lung disease required emergency treatment and one died. 20 A previous influenza outbreak in a NSW aged care facility in 2006 caused significant mortality and morbidity. That outbreak resulted in 14 hospital admissions and six deaths. 21 In our investigation we have found that 17% of the residents had chronic lung disease and 64% had chronic cardiac conditions both considered as high risk for severe complications of both rhinovirus and influenza infection. However, there were no hospitalisations or deaths in our outbreak investigation. Indeed only one resident developed fever, indicating that non-specific signs of illness (such as in our index case) may be the only, or early, indication of an ILI. Our own experience with managing other ILI outbreaks has also taught us that staff of ACFs may not be vigilant enough to detect fevers. In this outbreak, the nursing home staff, local GP, public health unit and the outbreak investigation team and supporting laboratory staff acted quickly and in a coordinated way. Pre-existing cross-reacting antibody in the very elderly (aged \u202185 years) probably helped to limit the spread of the pandemic virus (compared to the circulation of rhinovirus) within the ACF. Exposure to the 1918 pandemic (or a close variant occurring before 1925) appears to be responsible for a high HAI titre in the very elderly, which contributed towards better clinical protection. However, wider testing early on would have alerted us more quickly to the main cause of the outbreak. Treatment and prophylactic use of oseltamivir may also have contributed to halting the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and also to symptom relief.",

[1] [2] [3] We have developed a proprietary acid-polymer formulation to coat a standard FFP2 respirator with an antiviral layer. We aimed to test this coated respirator for antiviral efficacy against a range of influenza viruses. A series of tests compared the antiviral efficacy of coated and uncoated respirators in conditions designed to simulate real-life exposure to influenza by varying the route of inoculation, contact time, temperature, humidity, moisture, and contaminating substances. We also investigated whether infectious viruses could be transferred from contaminated respirator surfaces to gloves.",

For each test, three coated (GlaxoSmithKline Actiprotect) and three uncoated (Sperian Willson Easy Fit) FFP2 respirator samples were inoculated with 0AE2 ml of a viral suspension, which was applied with a pipette, sprayed, or aerosolised to create airborne droplets. After 1 minute at room temperature (on a shaker), the respirator samples were assayed for the presence of infectious viruses using standard methods. 4 In one test, after a 1 minute contact time of the respirator with the virus, nitrile gloves were applied with light pressure to the outer surface of inoculated respirator samples and then assayed after 1 minute.",

At the previous two meetings of this Conference, 1,3 we introduced our study of household transmission of seasonal influenza and reported our conclusion that protracted survival of the virus even after treatment increases household transmission, and is a major factor in the transmission of the virus to infants. On the other hand, during the recent pandemic, many schoolchildren developed serious respiratory tract disorders, which again highlights the significance of schoolbased transmission of the disease. In this study, we compared transmission of a new influenza strain at home and in school with that of seasonal influenza and proposed countermeasures.",

In this model, school children were divided into six groups depending on the stage of infection: uninfected period with no immunity, non-infectious latent period, infectious latent period, onset, post-onset infectious period, and immune period. It was assumed that schoolbased transmission occurred during the infectious latent period prior to onset and that no infections occurred during the post-onset infectious period because children were absent from school. Due to the long latent period of pdmH1, the distribution of the non-infectious latent period of pdmH1 was established as (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4) = (10%, 40%, 40%, 10%) and the distribution of the infectious period as (Day 0, Day 1, Day 2) = (10%, 80%, 10%). When simulations were performed under these conditions using the model for school-based transmission of influenza in which children from classes with an outbreak were kept at home for 3 days, the time course of changes in the number of affected individuals actually observed and the time course of changes in the number of expected cases were determined. The expected prevalence under these conditions was 35%. To evaluate the effect of school closure, simulations were performed based on the assumption that children from affected classes were not kept at home for 3 days. It was shown that there was an increase in the expected number of cases during the 3 days corresponding to the period of actual school closure and that the expected prevalence increased to 52%. Based on these findings, it was concluded that keeping children home from classes with an outbreak is an effective means of controlling the transmission of influenza in schools (shown in Figure 1 ).",

Other details of the results from the study were published elsewhere. 17 Discussion A non-significantly higher rate of pH1N1 infection was observed in study subjects who received TIV compared to placebo. Results from a multivariable logistic regression suggested that such a pattern might be explained by more common seasonal influenza infection in placebo group prior to the pandemic, protecting the placebo group against pH1N1. Seasonal influenza infection within 3-6 months observed in our study might have conferred better cross protection than TIV against pH1N1. This resembles similar previous findings on cross protection between influenza infections in human and animal studies. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] However, the same phenomenon has not been observed in some studies on seasonal influenza vaccine against pH1N1. 18, 21, [23] [24] [25] Apart from differences in study design and vaccine used, we speculate that a short time interval between pH1N1 and most recent seasonal influenza peak activities might be crucial for the phenomenon. Hong Kong is a subtropical area where the 2009 pandemic was preceded immediately by summer seasonal influenza circulation and a few months apart from the winter 2008-9 influenza peak. If cross protection from seasonal influenza lasts for only a short period, it might have waned below partial cross protection from TIV over time from last seasonal influenza infection. The current study is limited by a small sample size, and further studies are required to confirm our hypothesis.",

The occurrence of fever following adjuvanted vaccine, seen particularly after a second dose in younger children, was quantitatively associated with enhanced antibody titres. This association was not seen with unadjuvanted vaccine. This apparent difference between the relatedness of the pyrogenic and immunogenic effects of the two vaccines merits further investigation. Novel adjuvants appear to have the potential to overcome the relatively poor immunogenicity previously experienced with inactivated influenza vaccines in infants and young children. However, careful adjustment may be needed to optimise the balance between high protection and acceptable reaction rates. tries causing sporadic human infections. Vaccination has been used as an effective public health tool for influenza prophylaxis. The goal of this study was to evaluate live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) vaccine candidates for subtypes H1 and H5. The attenuated phenotype of H1 and H5 LAIV candidates has been proven in experiments in ovo and in vivo. In randomized clinical trials among adult volunteers, no significant adverse reactions attributable to the live vaccine occurred. Our results indicate that pandemic LAIV candidates were well tolerated and elicited serum, local, and cellular immune responses.",

All sera were stored at )20\u00b0C. All samples were tested at the Laboratory of Health Sciences Department, University of Genoa, by Haemagglutination-Inhibition (HI) and Neutralization (NT) assays, performed following the WHO criteria and standardised method in our laboratory, respectively. [11] [12] [13] Guinea pig red blood cells were used for HI assay. All samples were assayed twice for HI and for NT. The obtained antibody titre was expressed as the reciprocal of the last sera haemagglutinating or inhibiting virus dilution. Immunogenicity was determined by: geometric mean titre (GMT); mean-fold increase (MFI; ratio of post-to pre-vaccination titre); seroprotection rate (the percentage of subjects achieving an HI and NT titre \u202140 IU); and seroconversion rate (percentage of subjects with a fourfold increase in HI or NT antibody titers, providing a minimal post vaccination titer of 1:40). Post-vaccination GMT was reported as ratio, with the corresponding 95% confidence interval, of GMTs after vaccination with MF59-adjuvanted vaccine and with non-adjuvanted subunit vaccine. Seroprotection and seroconversion rate 95% confidence interval was calculated using modified Wald method. Comparisons of seroconversion and seroprotection rates between subunit and MF59-adjuvanted vaccine groups have been analyzed by Fischer's exact test. The results were evaluated against the committee for medicinal products for human use (CHMP) criteria for approval of influenza vaccines in the elderly, which require that at least one of the following criteria be met: MFI >2; seroprotection rate >60%, or seroconversion rate >30%. Furthermore, HI titres were also transformed into binary logarithms, corrected for pre-vaccination status, as described by Beyer et al. 14 and were expressed as median titres, with the corresponding 25\u00b0-75\u00b0i nter-quantile range. Comparisons of corrected post-vaccination titers between subunit and MF59-adjuvanted vaccine groups were analyzed by Wilcoxon test. Difference in immunogenicity profile between vaccine groups, expressed by ratio of different parameters, was correlated with genetic and antigenic distance between vaccine and viruses used in the study using Spearman test.",

[7] [8] [9] 15 In subjects vaccinated with the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine containing A \u2044 California \u2044 7 \u2044 04, the immune response, expressed by a number of parameters, such as crude and corrected postvaccination titers, seroconversion, and seroprotection rates calculated using HI and NT assays, is higher than that observed in individuals immunized with subunit vaccine when it is evaluated against a drifted strains, such as A \u2044 Brisbane \u2044 10 \u2044 07-like and A \u2044 Nepal \u2044 921 \u2044 06-like strains, and against egg-grown A \u2044 Brisbane \u2044 10 \u2044 07 virus. For the first time in this study, the impact of heterogeneity of circulating strains antigenically close to the vaccine on the antibody response elicited by MF59-and non-adiuvanted vaccines is evaluated. Immune response against viruses isolated during the 2004 \u2044 05 season, that appear more phylogenetically close to 2004 \u2044 05 vaccine strain A \u2044 Wyoming \u2044 3 \u2044 03, was higher in subjects vaccinated with MF59-adiuvanted vaccine as demonstrated by higher crude and corrected post-vaccination HI titres and higher postvaccination NT titres, with the exception of A \u2044 Genoa \u2044 27 \u2044 04, against whom the NT post-vaccination GMT is identical in MF59 and subunit vaccine groups. Furthermore, HI seroconversion and seroprotection rates were higher in MF59 vaccine group when evaluated against A \u2044 Genoa \u2044 13 \u2044 04 and A \u2044 Genoa \u2044 27 \u2044 04. As far as the immune response against A \u2044 California \u2044 7 \u2044 04-like viruses, the small number of enrolled subjects did not allow appreciating differences using qualitative response indicators, but crude post-vaccination HI titres were higher in MF59 vaccine group for all the strains. Interestingly, A \u2044 California \u2044 7 \u2044 04-like viruses with at least one amino acid change onto antigenic sites, i.e. A \u2044 Genoa \u2044 59 \u2044 04, A \u2044 Genoa \u2044 47 \u2044 05, and A \u2044 Genoa \u2044 62 \u2044 05, showed a more marked difference in terms of response between the two vaccine groups. Individuals immunized with MF59-adiuvanted vaccine showed higher corrected post-vaccination HI titres and post-vaccination NT titres in comparison with subjects vaccinated with plain vaccine. These response indicators were similar in the two vaccine groups when the response was evaluated against A \u2044 Genoa \u2044 2 \u2044 05 and A \u2044 Genoa \u2044 11 \u2044 04, which present no amino acid changes onto antigenic sites and identical HI titers respect with A \u2044 California \u2044 7 \u2044 04 at molecular and antigenic characterization, respectively. Thus, the advantage offered by MF59 in terms of higher immunogenicity expressed by higher post-vaccination HI titres is observable also against viruses showing antigenic and molecular pattern undistinguishable from vaccine strain, but it became even more evident as the antigenic and molecular distance between vaccine and circulating strains grew. As emerged for A \u2044 Genoa \u2044 59 \u2044 04, A \u2044 Genoa \u2044 47 \u2044 05, and A \u2044 Genoa \u2044 62 \u2044 05, one amino acid was a sufficient change in antigenic sites for 2-fold decrease of HI titre against homologous vaccine strain to observe 2-fold higher post-vaccination NT titers (MF59 \u2044 subunit postvaccination GMT ratio range between 1AE79 and 2AE45, Figure 1) and one-dilution higher corrected post-vaccination HI titers in MF59 vaccine group ( Figure 2) . Finally, the correlation between the distance and the improvement offered by MF59 in terms of higher immunogenicity clearly emerged by Spearman correlation analysis: it remains wellfounded both using a number of different response parameters obtained from HI and NT assays and calculating the distance by serological and genetic methods.",

In all incidents, epidemiological investigations have linked humans as the possible source of the infection to pigs. Experimentally, it was established that the virus is pathogenic and transmits readily in pigs. 1 The natural outbreaks of H1N1pdm and laboratory studies underscore the threat that the virus poses to the swine industry and highlight the need for developing effective control strategies. In the United States, a trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (FluMist\u00d2) has been licensed for use in humans since 2003. 2 In swine medicine, however, temperature-sensitive LAIVs are not available. Currently, only inactivated vaccines are available for pigs, but they provide limited protection against antigenically diverse influenza viruses. Additionally, the use of inactivated vaccines has been associated with enhanced pneumonia when immunized pigs were challenged with divergent viruses. 3 Thus, the development of LAIVs has the potential to circumvent the drawbacks associated with commercial vaccines.",

Moreover, the threat of human influenza epidemic and pandemic has dramatically increased in recent years. 3 Vaccination is one of the crucial interventions for reducing the spread and impact of influenza. The generally used parenteral inactivated influenza vaccines induce mainly systemic antibody responses and only weak cell-mediated immunity and low levels if any mucosal immunity. On the other hand, intranasal immunization with live virus can induces a broad spectrum of both systemic and mucosal antibodies, and the immune response localized in the mucosa blocks the virus even during the first phase of infection. Unfortunately, the use of live vaccines is always associated with a certain risk. The development of a crossprotective vaccine against potentially pandemic strains is an essential part of the strategy to control and prevent a pandemic outbreak. We induced intrasubtypic and intersubtypic cross-protection in BALB \u2044 c mice by intratracheal (IT) immunization with inactivated influenza viruses together with dead delipidated Bacillus firmus (DBF) as an adjuvant.

Adjuvant immunization was cross-protective: the mice immunized with a heterologous B strain (Figure 2 ) fell ill (pronounced body mass loss), but almost all survived and recovered. 5 The mice immunized with a heterologous A subtype were excellently protected (negligible weight loss and zero mortality). 6 Intratracheal DBF (500 lg per mouse) given to non-immunized mice 24 hour before influenza infection eliminated the lethal effect in 40-100% of infected animals depending on infection dose (0AE5-5 LD50); in mice infected with lower than lethal doses (0AE5 LD50), weight loss was minimized or did not occur.",

The attention is therefore focused on vaccines that are able to induce cross-protection and could be effective also in case of sudden appearance of a new virus variant. Inactivated influenza viruses are known to be often insufficiently effective when used for mucosal immunization and for induction of cross-protection against drifted influenza viruses or novel subtypes. The drawback of vaccination with dead virus can be overcome by using a suitable adjuvant. Mouse models were successfully immunized with vaccine containing inactivated virus in combination with cholera toxin or the Escheria coli heat-labile toxin (LT). [7] [8] [9] The use of cholera toxin in humans is precluded because of its high toxicity; a number of LT mutants that retain their adjuvant activity have been prepared; these mutants were likewise tested on the mouse model and should not cause any serious side effect in humans. For this reason, current studies aim at finding a suitable and safe mucosal and systemic immune response. DBF has been shown to be a very efficient adjuvant for mucosal immunization stimulating both innate and adaptive immunity. Intratracheal immunization with inactivated influenza viruses and DBF as adjuvant induced efficient and even heterosubtypic cross-protection. DBF given 24 hour before infection provided partial protection probably because of its strong stimulatory effect on the innate immunity.",

Replacement of PR8based internal genes into genome of VN-PR and INDO-PR reassortants with appropriate genes of MDV was realized by the classical reassortment procedure. Difficulties were encountered in obtaining 6:2 reassortants that contained both the HA and NA from the wild type avian H5N1 parental virus. In attempts to reassort the NIBRG-23 with MDV, the classical reassortment procedure was unsuccessful. The challenge faced was to break an incredibly strong gene constellation of the NIBRG-23 virus. Partial UV-inactivation of NIBRG-23 was encouraged in replacement of some PR8 internal genes with MDV genes 5 In some cases avian-human reassortant viruses with gull H13N6 and human influenza H1N1 genes were difficult to generate, and reassortants with the desired genotype of six gull virus genes with human influenza A H1 and N1 genes were not isolated despite repeated attempts. The gull PB2, NP, and NS genes were not present in any of the gull-human H1N1 reassortants generated. 6 It is difficult to fully understand potential reasons for observed difficulties to reassort some avian viruses with human strains. Unsuccessful attempts to develop 6:2 vaccine reassortants may be caused by an observed strong connection of PB2 and NA genes in the genome of A \u2044 H5N1-PR8-RG viruses. In our attempts, each reassortant that possessed avian N1 neuraminidase inheritied PB2 gene of PR8 as well. And vice versa, the 'cold' PB2 gene always appeared to be coupled with the N2 neuraminidase of the MDV. In some cases, step by step co-infection of triple reassortants (H5N1-H1N1-H2N2) with H2N2 MDV may be the only possibility to generate a cold-adapted vaccine reassortant.",

The devised pandemic vaccine meets WHO requirements as well as requirements concerning safety and immunogenicity of the National Pharmacopeias of the Republic of Kazakhstan and Russian Federation. [9] [10] [11] [12] The devised technology for vaccine production differs from the previous technologies for production of allantoic whole-virion influenza A \u2044 H1N1 vaccines in its processdependent parameters. Presence of an adjuvant (aluminum hydroxide) increases significantly the vaccine immunogenicity and allows maximal reduction of the dose of the administered antigen that, in turn, results in diminished reactogenicity of the vaccine. Aluminum hydroxide is an adjuvant that is most frequently used in clinical practice. 13 To date the results of the double-centered randomized study of the Europe-licensed vaccine Fluval P [monovalent inactivated whole-virion influenza vaccine with aluminum phosphate based on strain A \u2044 California \u2044 07 \u2044 2009 (H1N1) NYMC X-179A (Omninvest, Pilisborosjeno, Hungary)] that is similar to the Refluvac preparation are published.

According to toxicology and necroscopy results, the live monovalent influenza vaccine Influvir, when applied intranasally, was safe and was well tolerated. 5 In our current study we demonstrate that A(H1N1) and A(H7N3) LAIV are indistinguishable from the parental MDS virus with regards to replication kinetics in the upper and lower respiratory tract of mice.

Antibody was detected in the group of mice injected 10 lg protein after the first immunization and detected in the group of mice injected 2 lg protein after the second immunization. Thus, potency of the present inactivated whole virus vaccine was demonstrated in mice. Next, to assess the protective immunity of the inactivated vaccine in mice, viral titers in the lungs was determined. The virus titers in the lungs were 10 1AE5 -10 3AE7 EID 50 \u2044 g in the groups of mice injected 10, and 2 lg protein, and 10 5AE3 -10 6AE0 EID 50 \u2044 g in the other vaccinated groups.

H9N2 viruses were isolated from pigs and humans in China 3 and Korea, suggesting that H9N2 virus would be a potential for a pandemic influenza virus in human population. H9N2 viruses were isolated from pigs in China and Korea and were classified into the G9 and Korean sublineage. In human cases, all H9N2 virus isolated from humans in China was classified into the G1 sublineage. It was suggested that H9N2 viruses isolated from pigs and humans vary in antigenicity of isolates between the Korean, G9, and G1 sublineages. Therefore, it is important for the preparedness of influenza pandemic to develop H9 influenza virus vaccine, which could broadly cross-react to antisera of all sublineage viruses. So, we selected the vaccine candidate strain, Dk \u2044 Hok \u2044 49 \u2044 98, which could broadly cross-react to antisera of all sublineage viruses, and which could replicate In this study, it was suggested that the test vaccine has potency to protect against challenge with H9 virus using mice for mammalian model. The challenge virus, HK \u2044 1073 \u2044 99, was isolated from human, replicates efficiently in mice, and shows pathogenicity in mice. The test vaccine inhibited viral replication and body weight loss in mice. Whole inactivated vaccine produced protective immunity, supporting our approach of using whole virus particles for vaccine development. Furthermore, whole particle virus vaccine could induce IgG and mucosal IgA levels after intranasal vaccination with whole particle vaccine. 13 The present results may facilitate the studies of the vaccine for future pandemic caused by H9 influenza virus in humans.",

Vaccine viruses can be grown in embryonated chicken eggs 2 or in certified mammalian cells. 3, 4 Unfortunately wildtype H1N1pdm virus strains distributed by the WHO grew poorly in cell lines and eggs, requiring the generation of a series of 3 conventional and 8 reverse genetics 5 derived reassortants to attempt to improve growth.

Interestingly this virus was unable to be isolated in eggs. The HA sequences of all strains were assessed at p1, p2, p3, p4, p10 and when available compared to the original clinical sample HA sequence. MDCK33016PF-isolated viruses had few if any changes in their HA amino acid sequence, while the majority of egg isolates showed 1-2 amino acid changes compared to the clinical sample, with an egg adaption change (L191I) evident in a number of them.

The proportion of seroresponse to pH1N1 with the titer of 40, 80, and 160 (Highest titer detected from participants of all ages in this study) and the value of GMT were analyzed according to the birth decade of subjects from 1915. Similarly, a peak of antibody response and the value of GMT occurred both in subjects born from 1915 to 1925 and sharply decreased afterward ( Figure 1 ). The seroresponse of subjects born in and before 1925 is significantly higher than subjects born afterward (P < 0AE05). ",

Previous infection and vaccination with A \u2044 New Jersey \u2044 76 may also contribute to the high level of cross-reactive antibody response to pH1N1 among adults older than 60 years in the US. 10, 11 The peak of the antibody response to pH1N1 in subjects born between 1915 and 1925, which is consistent with recent reports, may suggest the previous viral infections of 1918 Spanish flu or closely related influenza viruses, which is before and little after the year of 1918. Recent antigenic report of new pH1N1 viruses indicated that they are antigenically homogeneous among historical viruses, which are most similar to classical swine A(H1N1) viruses. A number of reviews [12] [13] [14] [15] confirmed that the 1918 virus is the likely ancestor of all four of the human and swine H1N1 and H3N2 lineages, as well as the 'extinct' H2N2 lineage. In 1930, A(H1N1) influenza viruses were first isolated from swine. They have been shown to be antigenically highly similar to the recently reconstructed human 1918 A(H1N1) virus. 16 The cellular responses may contribute to the sustaining and long term antibody response. Probably, boosting by persisting antigenically related viruses in the early decades of the 20th century, may have contributed to the ability of these subjects to sustain memory B cells, 17 and it is well established that a subset of plasma cells is long-lived, and these cells contribute to durable humoral immune responses, 18 such as that observed after childhood smallpox vaccination. Furthermore, T cells that recognize cross-reactive epitopes are preserved and might be enriched in the memory population; the course of each infection is influenced by the T-cell memory pool that has been laid down by a host's history of previous successive infections. 19 Our study indicated that wide transmission of this new virus or any antigenically close related influenza A(H1N1) viruses may not have circulated among populations in China before the outbreak of pH1N1. Our data also suggests the need for vaccination with pH1N1 vaccine in all age groups.",

Therefore, patients routinely receive replacement therapy with immunoglobulins isolated from healthy blood donors. 1 These patients are also prone to get viral infections, possibly due to defects in toll-like receptors 8 and 9. 2 Because these patients lack an antigen specific humoral immune response, they are rarely vaccinated. The ability of hypogammaglobulinemic patients to produce a specific cell-mediated immune response upon vaccination has only been sparsely investigated. In contrast to local mucosal antibodies, vaccine-induced cell-mediated immunity is not believed to protect against pathogen entry per se, but may be sufficient to provide protection against severe disease and death following transmission of some microbes. 3, 4 The aim of this pilot study was to investigate if influenza vaccination of hypogammaglobulinemic patients can induce an influenza-specific cell-mediated immune response. We therefore vaccinated hypogammaglobulinemic patients and healthy controls with pandemic H1N1 virus vaccine and subsequently investigated the Bcell and T-cell responses. The percentages of IFN-c, IL-2, and TNF-a cytokine producing CD4+ Th1-cells were determined, as these cytokines are important indicators of cell-mediated immunity.",

[9] [10] [11] In this study, we also investigated cell-mediated immunity and found the percentages of homologous and cross-reactive influenza-specific CD4+ Th1-cells to be in the same range (for patient #3, #4, and #5) or higher (for patient #1 and #2) in the a-or hypogammaglobulinemic patients compared to the healthy controls. The higher response is probably due to the patients having received a vaccine dose of 7AE5 lg HA, whilst the controls received 3AE75 lg HA. In addition, the patients received a second booster dose, which influences the day 42 and 3 months responses. Nonetheless, these results are the first to demonstrate that proliferation of pandemic influenza antigen specific Th1cells can be induced in hypogammaglobulinemic patients. In addition, vaccination induced influenza-specific ASC's in some patients. The findings are promising and provide hope that hypogammaglobulineamic patients could be vaccinated against influenza and other diseases preventable by Figure 2 . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells s from patients and healthy controls were isolated at day 21 (A), 42 (B), and day 90 (C) and stimulated for 17 hour with X179A virus before staining and flow cytometric analysis. The figure shows the mean \u00b1 SD frequency of influenza-specific CD4+ cytokine producing cells (%) where the basal cytokine production from unstimulated cells has been subtracted. Data for the hypogammaglobulinemia patients are additionally shown as a number for each patient. **Significantly higher frequency of IL-2 producing CD4+ T-cells in the patients compared to the healthy controls (students T-test P < 0AE05).

            "text": "The influenza virus undergoes antigenic evolution under intense immune selection pressure from herd immunity in humans through the process called antigenic drift and shift. 1,2 Because of antigenic drift, yearly updating of vaccine strain is needed. A mismatch between the circulating strains and the vaccine strain in the subsequent season is often encountered, resulting in reduction of vaccine effectiveness and lack of protection from the circulating strain. 3 In order to address this, a universal influenza vaccine based on a more conserved part of the influenza virus, which is not affected by antigenic change and that is conserved across all strains, remains the ultimate goal to afford cross-protection to drifted strains as well as to other subtypes of influenza which may arise from antigenic shift. 4, 5 Previous studies have investigated the potential of the M2e. 6, 7 M2e has remained highly conserved since it was first isolated in 1933. 6 Several studies have examined the use of M2e as a vaccine component, using various approaches including proteins, peptides, DNA vectors, and attenuated viral vectors. 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Although M2e is a weak antigen, by linking the protein to a carrier hepatitis B virus core particle, protection against influenza has been achieved in mice particularly when administered with an adjuvant. 3 Some articles found that vaccination with M2e coupled to HBC induces protective antibodies, whereas the contribution of T cells to protection was negligible. Protection induced by vaccination with M2e-HBC was weak overall and failed to prevent weight loss in vaccinated infected animals, and mice succumbed to high dose infection. 14 We aimed to address the poor immunogenicity of M2e-HBC by using IgV as adjuvant. IgV domain is common and conserved in the TIM family. Ligand binding sites of T cell immunoglobulin mucin (TIM) located at IgV domain. [15] [16] [17] TIM function is done by anti TIM antibody which recognized the ligand binding sites of IgV domain. 18 TIM family members share a common motif, including an IgV domain. They are differentially expressed on Th1 cells and Th2 cells with the ability to regulate the immune system. 19, 20 The IgV domain of human B7-2 is sufficient to co-stimulate T lymphocytes and induce cytokine secretion. 21 Soo Hoo et al. vaccinated with TIM-1 antibody and inactivated influenza and found enhanced vaccine-specific immune response. 22 We report here for the first time the use of IgV recombinant protein as adjuvant to immunize mice with influenza M2e-HBC. Results indicated that IgV can induce the strong cellular immune response and cross reaction with different subtype influenza virus antigen. Target IgV may be used to develop the new method for vaccination strategies.",

A vaccine based on coupling of the M2e peptide to an appropriate carrier may provide a universal vaccine with effectiveness and safety.

Analysis was stratified according to age groups, time (month of onset), presence or absence of chronic disease, and previous influenza vaccination.

The reference viruses containing inactivated split virus vaccines are produced in embryonated chicken eggs, and primarily result in the production of antibodies that recognize the viral glycoproteins. Both of these vaccine approaches require significant lead time for vaccine production, and modern approaches to speed preparation of vaccines and improve their efficacy is a global priority. 1, 2 The NS1 protein of influenza A virus is a multifunctional protein that plays important roles in virus replication and as potent type I IFN antagonist. 3, 4 Mutations and \u2044 or deletions in NS1 typically induce stronger IFN responses by the host; those in turn suppress the replication of influenza virus 3-7 and can enhance immune recognition.

NS1-73 was the least attenuated and does not represent a good vaccine candidate; whereas, NSD5 and NS1-126 were highly attenuated in both the mouse and ferret models. Although they were markedly attenuated, they elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses and protected mice and ferrets from subsequent challenge. NSD5 has a subtle in-frame deletion (15 nt) that affects both the NS1 (residues 196-200) and NEP (residues 39-43), and is analogous to a naturally attenuated variant of a normally highly pathogenic H5N1 virus (A \u2044 SW \u2044 FJ \u2044 03). 16 The analogous NS1 deletion in A \u2044 SW \u2044 FJ \u2044 03 (residues 191-195) was shown to reduce binding to host cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), reduce NS1 protein stability, and enhance the type I IFN response of this H5N1 virus. 16 Our study indicates that deletion of these 15nt in the NS vRNA of the H1N1pdm also stimulates the host IFN response, specifically, IFN-\u00df, IFN-k1, IP10, and MxA (data not shown). The role of the deletion of residues 39-43 from NEP has not been elucidated, but the induction of IFN and ISGs by NSD5 was similar to, or slightly lower than, their induction by NS-126, suggesting that the NEP mutation also has an attenuating effect that warrants future investigation. In summary, we have generated a panel of LAIVs directly from a swab specimen containing a new pandemic virus and analyzed their attenuation and immunogenicity in two animal models. Our study demonstrates that NSD5 is a novel NS-LAIV that could be used to create LAIVs for diverse influenza A viruses. This study also validates the use of NS-LAIV candidates, which are not only highly attenuated, but they also elicit strong innate and adaptive immune responses, resulting in protection of mice from subsequent challenge with a lethal mouse-adapted variant of NY1682, and ferrets from challenge with A \u2044 Mexico \u2044 4482 \u2044 2009 (H1N1pdm).

As a wt strain, B \u2044 Brisbane \u2044 60 \u2044 2008 was used, which is one of the recommended influenza B virus vaccine strains for the 2009 \u2044 10 and 2010 \u2044 11 seasons. We found that B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90 is a useful donor, and some of the resultant reassortants were considered as vaccine candidates. 5 B reassortant viruses were prepared by the classical reassortment method described by Kilbourne. 1 The antiserum to B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90 hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (HANA) was raised in this study by immunizing rabbits with HANA isolated from B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90; purified IgG was used for antibody selection. The yields of the reassortants and their corresponding parent viruses were assessed by hemagglutination assay. Viral RNA was extracted directly from the allantoic fluid and amplified by RT-PCR to produce cDNA for analyzing the gene composition. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analyses were performed to determine the origin of each gene segment of the high yield reassortants. Restriction enzyme sets for each gene segment are available upon request.",

After co-infection of B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90 and B \u2044 Brisbane \u2044 60 \u2044 2008, progeny viruses carrying surface antigens (HA and NA) of the vaccine strain were negatively selected by anti-B \u2044 Panama HANA antibodies, followed by passages without antibodies for positive selection of eggadapted viruses and finally limited dilution cloning. NYMC BX-33, BX-33B, BX-33D, and R-3A are representative of resultant reassortants, which have significantly higher HA titers than the wt strain. The complete gene compositions of these reassortants were determined by RT-PCR \u2044 RFLP analyses. As shown in Table 1 , all of these reassortants contained the PB2 of B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90. Other genes of B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90 (NP of BX-33, M of BX-33B, and PB1 of BX-33D) may not be involved in the high virus yield, since no significant growth difference among these reassortants in eggs was found as assayed by hemagglutination test. Accordingly, the PB2 of B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90 is considered to be the sole factor involved in the high yield phenotype donated to the vaccine strain. We previously found that the B \u2044 Lee \u2044 40 NP gene was important in producing high yield B reassortants. It was of interest to examine whether B \u2044 Lee \u2044 40 NP and B \u2044 Panama PB2 could work together to produce even higher yields. To test this possibility, BX-33B (2:6 reassortant: PB2 and M genes from B \u2044 Panama and the rest of the genes from B \u2044 Brisbane) was selected and further reassorted with B \u2044 Lee \u2044 40. Despite some difficulty in removing the NA gene of B \u2044 Lee \u2044 40 (R-4C, 7B, 10B in Table 2 ), by monitoring HA and NA genes of resultant viruses after each antibody selection passage with anti B \u2044 Lee \u2044 40 HANA antibodies, we were able to isolate and clone a triple reassortant, NYMC BX-35, which contains the NP gene from B \u2044 Lee \u2044 40 and PB2 and M genes from B \u2044 Panama; the remaining genes are from B \u2044 Brisbane \u2044 60 \u2044 2008 (Table 2 ). In comparison with BX-33B, no significant growth enhancement (nor reduction) in eggs was found for BX-35 over that seen for BX-33B. Nevertheless, BX-35 stably produces high virus yield and has been utilized as a seed virus for influenza B vaccine production for the 2010-2011 season by one or more vaccine manufacturers.",

            "text": "The bioinformatics derived from unique viral genome sequences generated from this study based on constant RT-PCR amplification scheme and identical Roche 454 pyrosequencing protocols provide a reliable data set in predicting the evolutionary patterns of pandemic viruses. WRAIR received clinical samples from US Embassies and military personnel throughout the world since the initial WHO announcement of 2009 novel H1N1 outbreaks. Nearly equal distributions of sequenced viruses derived from three broadly categorized geographic regions, North America, Central \u2044 South America, and Asia \u2044 Europe \u2044 Africa (data not shown). Besides the geographic distribution pattern of viral isolates, Figure 1 displays the viral isolation time lines of all the sequenced viruses reflecting two peaks that coincided with two waves of 2009 pandemic infections, early-mid summer and fall of 2009. 15 Phylogenetic trees of the eight influenza A segments of all sequenced viruses were tentatively generated. It was found that the substitution frequencies per site for the HA, NA, and NS genes are at much higher rate than the other five genes, PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and MP genes (data not shown). The observed higher genetic variations for HA and NA genes of 2009 H1N1 are consistent with the historical genomic and epidemiological dynamics data of human influenza A revealing higher temporal fluctuations in HA and NA genes. [16] [17] [18] [19] Analysis of full influenza genomes containing concatenated eight complete RNA segments revealed the existence of two distinctive genetic clades in circulation since the beginning of 2009 pandemic, as shown in Fig-ure 2. It is noteworthy that all viruses of Mexico and California origins (Clade 1 shown at the top of Figure 2 ) were isolated at the beginning of 2009 pandemic prior to the isolation of all other viruses belonging to the second genetic Clade 2. 18, 20 Discussion During the past decade, the advance of DNA sequencing technology, such as development of NGS, in making full viral genome sequences readily available have enabled study of far broader and more detailed aspects of evolutionary change for any new emergent infectious pathogen. The massive sequencing capacity of Roche 454 FLX system allows simultaneously process and sequence millions of individual cDNA molecules, in contrast to processing and sequencing individual cDNA fragments by conventional Sanger sequencing method. Within a short period of few months since the beginning of the 2009 pandemics, WRAIR accomplished large number of representative 2009 H1N1 full genomes of worldwide origins via Roche 454 FLX system. Sequencing data derived from this study illustrates a much higher genetic variation rate for HA and NA genes of 2009 H1N1 that is compatible to the higher temporal fluctuation rate for HA and NA genes of seasonal Influenza A derived from decades of intensive monitoring and comparison studies and analyses. [16] [17] [18] [19] Following the Mexican and US reported cases, confirmed outbreaks of 2009 swine H1N1 rapidly proliferated and spread throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, most probably via global airline travel. 5, 6 It seemed that new cases in the US and most cases throughout the world had been clinically mild relative to the initial reported cases in Mexico. [21] [22] [23] [24] Here we demonstrate through the phylogenetic relationship of sequenced 2009 H1N1 full genomes that the clinical isolates could be divided into two different clades of viruses, i.e., the Clade 1 genetic group contains only viruses isolated at the beginning (March \u2044 April 2009, Mexico and California) of 2009 pandemics and the rest of other viruses all belong to the 2nd genetic group, Clade 2. Thus, it's likely that the currently circulating 2009 H1N1 of Clade 2 causing worldwide infections is genetically different from the initial 2009 H1N1 isolates that caused the early infections in Mexico and California. 18, 20 Introduction A pandemic influenza virus (2009 H1N1) was recently introduced into the human population. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of 2009 H1N1 is derived from 'classical swine H1N1' virus, which likely shares a common progenitor strain with the human H1N1 virus that caused the pandemic in 1918. 1 Since antigenic changes of influenza virus HA occur more slowly in swine than in humans, 2 we hypothesized that 2009 H1N1 might still retain an antigenic structure similar to that of 1918 H1N1 or the early isolates of its descendants.",

To investigate the structures of these antigenic sites of 2009 H1N1, 3D structures of the HA molecules of SC1918, the recent seasonal human H1N1 virus (BR2007), and 2009 H1N1 (CA2009) were constructed by a homology modeling approach, and compared by mapping all the amino acid residues that were distinct from those of SC1918 HA (data not shown). We found that most of these antigenic sites of BR2007 HA predominantly contained altered amino acid residues if compared with SC1918. By contrast, amino acid residues at these positions were relatively conserved in CA2009 HA when compared with SC1918 HA. Notably, the Sa and Sb sites, which contain many amino acids involved in neutralizing epitopes near the receptor binding pockets, remain almost intact ( Table 1 ), suggesting that antibodies raised by natural infection with SC1918 or its antigenically related descendant viruses play a role in specific immunity against CA2009. These observations lead us to hypothesize that such antigenic sites involving the conserved amino acids will soon be targeted by antibody-mediated selection pressure in the human population. Based on this hypothesis, we speculated that 2009 H1N1 would undergo patterns of amino acid substitutions in HA similar to those seen in seasonal human H1N1 viruses during its epidemic period (i.e. those that have been substituted since 1934) (Figure 1) . We then predicted possible amino acid substitutions of 2009 H1N1 from the sequence similarity of the antigenic sites. For example, both SC1918 and CA2009 had an Asn residue at position 142 in the Sa site. For SC1918, the residue at this position has altered from Asn to Lys since 1942. Combining these two facts, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that CA2009 will also undergo an amino acid substitution from Asn to Lys at position 142 in the future. Interestingly, we found that some of the recent variants of the 2009 H1N1 virus have indeed undergone substitutions identical to those predicted in Figure 1 . It is important to monitor whether such variants will be selected and survive in sustained circulation in humans.",

Previously, we reported that Cand1 sites, a set of three codons that require single nucleotide substitution to produce N-glycosylation sequons, were important motifs to rapidly acquire N-glycosylation sequons. 5 Therefore, we investigated the number and location of potential N-glycosylation sites and Cand1 sites in 2009 H1N1 HA. We found that CA2009 also had a single N-glycosylation sequon at the same position in the globular head region of HA, and lacked the multiple N-glycosylations that have been observed in the antigenic changes of the human H1N1 virus during the early epidemic of this virus. We also found that CA2009 HA possessed three Cand1 sites that were present at the same position in SC1918 HA (positions of the first Asn residue, 177, 179, and 184). Of these, the Cand1 sites with positions at 177 and 179 had actually become potential N-glycosylation sites in human H1N1 viruses. This result suggests the likelihood of additional N-glycosylation at these sites during future antigenic changes of 2009 H1N1 HA. Notably, some of the recent 2009 H1N1 variants (as of March 24, 2010) have an additional N-glycosylation sequon at position 179, where the 1918 H1N1 virus readily acquired an N-glycosylation site during its circulation.",

Influenza A has evolved in association with its various hosts on different continents for extended periods of time. 1 To survive as a successful pathogen, the influenza viruses have developed a number of mechanisms, including antigenic mutation and genome reassortment, to continuously evolve and evade the surveillance of the host immune systems.

Such information will allow us to detect the genetic origin of newly found viruses, track their genetic changes, and identify potential genome reassortments. A hierarchical nomenclature system has been proposed and adopted for HPAI HA clades and sub-clades by WHO Influenza Surveillance Centers. 6 Wan et al. also proposed a hierarchical approach for influenza A viral genotypes system. 13 The work presented here is one of the first steps towards the development of a nomenclature system for influenza A virus lineages (at the segment level) and genotypes (at the genome level). Whether the naming system will be accepted and used by the influenza research community is more challenging than the lineage analysis itself. Identification of the genetic origins of influenza A viruses will enhance our understanding the evolution and adaptation mechanisms of influenza viruses. The phylogenetic analysis is the traditional approach to identify the influenza progenitor. First, the nucleotide sequences are aligned using multiple sequence alignment methods, such as ClustalW, 3 MUSCLE, 4 and T-COFFEE. 5 Second, phylogenetic analysis is performed on these aligned sequences to infer their evolutionary relationship using Neighbor-Joining (NJ), 6 Likelihood, or Bayesian inference. 8 Bootstrap analyses or computation of posterior probability are usually applied to estimate the phylogenetic uncertainty. However, this phylogenetic analysis is time consuming due to intensive computations in multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic inferences. It is difficult to perform an analysis using this method on a large dataset, for instance, with more than 1000 taxa, as is the common case for influenza studies.",

Current laboratory methods for characterizing influenza are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and few viral strains undergo full characterization. 1 Even fewer strains from domestic poultry and swine or from wild aquatic birds are wellcharacterized. These strains are important for global surveillance since they are thought to be the precursors to pandemic influenza strains. 2 We have designed a highthroughput Global Bio Laboratory to address these surveillance needs. The goal of this project was to develop highspeed and high-volume laboratory capabilities for extensive surveillance and rapid and accurate detection and analysis of influenza. The workflow consists of surveillance, sample transportation, laboratory testing, data management and analysis. Five robotic systems have been designed for this laboratory: sample accessioning, biobanking, screening, viral culture, and sequencing. Sample accessioning logs barcodes, centrifuges, and aliquots samples are then sent to biobanking. The robotic biobank stores samples at )80\u00b0C and reformats tubes for screening. The screening system extracts RNA and confirms the presence and subtype of influenza. Aliquots of positive samples are sent to the viral culturing system for scale-up. Finally, cultured samples are extracted and sent to the sequencing system for full genome sequencing. The sample accessioning, sequencing, and biobanking systems have been built, delivered, and validation processes are currently being completed. Robotic screening and culturing systems have been fully designed and are ready to be built. A Biosafety Level 3-enhanced containment laboratory was built to enable the flow of samples containing highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. In full operation, this approach to surveillance is designed to enable the sequencing of up to10 000 full virus genomes per year, more than the total of all full influenza genomes sequenced to date.",

Alternate assays are conceived for processes that are not automation-friendly. Waste streams, worker safety, and space constraints are considered. Each possibility is taken to reduce processes that have the potential to aerosolize or cross-contaminate influenza samples. Instruments must be found that fit the capabilities needed. Detailed specifications for each of the robotic systems were written including all the parameters listed above. Once the systems are built, a long validation process takes place where the processes and instruments in each system are adjusted to function together properly. Finally, a validation study is performed to ensure that the system is able to produce useful data for influenza research.

The present study was performed to investigate the mechanism by which influenza C virus M gene-specific mRNA (M mRNA) is readily spliced. Ribonuclease protection assays showed that the splicing of M mRNA in infected cells was much higher than that in M gene-transfected cells, suggesting that viral protein(s) other than M gene-translational products facilitates the splicing of viral mRNAs. The unspliced and spliced mRNAs of the influenza C virus NS gene encode two nonstructural (NS) proteins, NS1 (C \u2044 NS1) and NS2 (C \u2044 NS2), respectively. The introduction of translational premature termination into the NS gene, which blocked the synthesis of C \u2044 NS1 and C \u2044 NS2 proteins, drastically reduced the splicing of NS mRNA, raising the possibility that C \u2044 NS1 or C \u2044 NS2 enhances the splicing of viral mRNAs. The splicing of influenza C virus M mRNA was increased by co-expression of C \u2044 NS1, whereas it was reduced by co-expression of influenza A virus NS1 protein (A \u2044 NS1). The splicing of influenza A virus M mRNA was also increased by co-expression of C \u2044 NS1, whereas it was inhibited by that of A \u2044 NS1.

Influenza A virus NS1 protein associates with spliceosomes and inhibits pre-mRNA splicing. 3, 4 Two cis-acting sequences in the NS1 transcript (positions 153-465 in the intron and positions 775-860 in the 3\u00a2 exon region) inhibit splicing. 5 By contrast, influenza C virus M gene-specific mRNA (M mRNA) is efficiently spliced in influenza C virus-infected cells. 6 In this study, we examined the mechanism by which influenza C virus M mRNA is efficiently spliced and the regulatory mechanism of the splicing of NS gene-specific mRNA (NS mRNA). The introduction of a translational pre-mature termination into the influenza C virus NS gene, thereby blocking the synthesis of influenza C virus NS1 (C \u2044 NS1) and NS2 (C \u2044 NS2) proteins, drastically reduced the splicing rate of NS mRNA. We further examined whether C \u2044 NS1 potentially facilitates viral mRNA splicing. The splicing rate of M mRNA of influenza C virus was increased by co-expression with C \u2044 NS1, whereas it was reduced by co-expression with influenza A virus NS1 protein (A \u2044 NS1) (Figure 2A ). The splicing of influenza A virus M gene-specific mRNA was also increased by co-expression with C \u2044 NS1, though it was inhibited by co-expression with A \u2044 NS1 ( Figure 2B ). These results suggest that influenza C virus NS1 can facilitate viral mRNA splicing, but in no way inhibit it, which is in striking contrast to the inhibitory effect of influenza A virus NS1 on pre-mRNA splicing. 3, 4 The mechanism for splicing enhancement by C \u2044 NS1 also remains to be determined. We speculate that C \u2044 NS1 may interact with some host proteins involved in splicing, thereby leading to an up-regulation in splicing, or that C \u2044 NS1 may bind to pre-mRNA, increasing its accessibility to the spliceosome.",

By contrast, unspliced mRNA from the influenza C virus M gene encodes the CM2 ion channel, which is permeable to chloride ions, 10 and also has pH-modulating activity. 11 Although the role of the influenza C virus CM2 ion channel in virus replication remains to be determined, it is conceivable that the over-expression of the CM2 protein has a deleterious effect on virus replication since the fact that a high level of influenza A virus M2 protein expression inhibits the rate of intracellular transport of the influenza A virus HA protein and other integral membrane glycoproteins has been demonstrated. 12 If this is the case, efficient splicing of M mRNA may control the amount of CM2 synthesized to optimize virus replication. Therefore, we speculate that efficient splicing of M mRNA leads to a high level of M1 expression and the reduced expression of CM2, thereby creating conditions that are optimal for virus replication. In this study, we provided evidence that C \u2044 NS1 facilitates the splicing of M mRNA. Furthermore, C \u2044 NS1 may regulate the splicing efficiency of its own NS mRNA during infection, controlling the amount of C \u2044 NS1 and C \u2044 NS2 proteins in infected cells. C \u2044 NS2 plays an important role in the nuclear export of vRNP, and is also associated with vRNP in the later stages of infection in virus-infected cells and is incorporated into virions, 13 suggesting that C \u2044 NS2 is involved, not only in the sorting of vRNP into the assembly site, but also in virus assembly. Therefore, it is likely that there is a mechanism by which an appropriate amount of C \u2044 NS2 is provided during infection to accomplish these functions. In conclusion, C \u2044 NS1, which enhances the splicing of viral mRNA, may regulate both the expression level of M gene-derived M1 and CM2 proteins, and that of NS gene-derived NS1 and NS2 proteins, thereby leading to optimal virus replication.",

The binding data were converted to Scatchard plots (A490 \u2044 C versus A490), and the association constants of the virus-fetuin complexes were determined from the slopes of these plots. Viral cell tropism and replication efficiency in human airway epithelium were studied using fully differentiated cultures of human tracheo-bronchial epithelial cells (HTBE). 10, 11 To determine cell tropism, cultures were infected at a moi 1, fixed 8 hours after infection, and double immuno-stained for virus antigen and cilia of ciliated cells. Infected cells were counted under the microscope (100\u00b7 objective with oil immersion) in the epithelial segment that included 15-30 consecutive microscopic fields containing between 5% and 20% ciliated cells relative to the total number of superficial cells.

This result contrasted with the binding of H1N1pdm viruses to several 2-3-specific probes in carbohydrate microarray analysis. 12 Reduced avidity of virus interactions with soluble glycoprotein in solution as compared to its binding to the probe clustered on the microarray surface could account for these differences in the assay results. The D222G mutant Ham-e differed from the parent virus by its ability to bind to 3-Fet and by its reduced binding to 6-Fet. The Q223R mutant only bound to 2-3-Fet, although less strongly than did the avian virus A \u2044 Duck \u2044 Alberta \u2044 119 \u2044 98 (H1N1).",

Under these conditions, Ham and Ham-e infected comparable numbers of cells, whereas Ham-e1 infected at least 10 times less cells (data not shown). This result indicated that the mutation Q223R markedly impaired the ability of Ham-e1 to infect human airway epithelial cultures.

These changes could account for increased replication of the D222G mutant in the lower respiratory tract in humans 5-7 and pigs 2 and correlation of this mutation with severe pulmonary disease. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The D222G mutant replicates less efficiently in human airway cultures than the original virus. This finding correlates with an apparent lack of transmission of variants with 222G in humans 3 and pigs. 2 Egg-derived mutation Q223R abolishes virus binding to 2-6-linked receptors and strongly decreases infection in cultures of human airway epithelium. This result agrees with poor infectivity of the Q223R mutant in pigs 2 and highlights potential pitfalls of using egg-adapted viruses with this mutation for the preparation of live influenza vaccines. nin-esterase-fusion (HEF), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix (M1) protein, CM2, and the non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2. 1,2 CM2 is the second membrane protein of the virus and is encoded by RNA segment 6 (M gene). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] It is composed of three distinct domains: a 23-residue N-terminal extracellular domain, a 23-residue transmembrane domain, and a 69-residue cytoplasmic domain. 3, 9, 10 It is abundantly expressed at the plasma membranes of infected cells and is incorporated in a small amount into virions. 10,11 CM2 forms disulphide-linked dimers and tetramers, and is posttranslationally modified by N-glycosylation, palmitoylation, and phosphorylation. [10] [11] [12] Analyses of a number of CM2 mutants revealed the positions of the amino acids involved in the posttranslational modifications. 10, 13 Evidence was obtained that the N-glycosylation was not required for either the formation of disulfide-linked multimers or transport to the cell surface, 10 and that none of dimer-or tetramer-formation, palmitoylation or phosphorylation was essential to the transport of CM2 to the cell surface. 13 In the present study, in order to investigate the effect of CM2 palmitoylation on influenza C virus replication, we generated a CM2 palmitoylation-deficient influenza C virus, in which a cysteine at residue 65 of CM2 was mutated to alanine, and examined the viral growth and viral protein synthesis in infected cells.",

In the present study, we showed that the affinity of NP to the plasma membrane of rCM2-C65A-infected cells was slightly lower than that to the plasma membrane of rWT-infected cells. This observation may suggest that palmitoylation of CM2 is involved in the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) incorporation, leading to efficient infectious virion generation. We hypothesize that palmitoylation contributes to proper regional structure formation in the CM2 cytoplasmic tail, which is competent to recruit vRNP efficiently into virions. Alternatively, the CM2 cytoplasmic tail without palmitoylation is not likely to reach the proper conformation, resulting in reduced interaction with vRNP and less efficient generation of infectious progeny virions. The questions of if and how the M1 protein is involved in the interaction between the CM2 cytoplasmic tail and NP remains to be clarified. We showed that CM2 synthesized in rCM2-C65Ainfected cells was oligomerized and transported to the cell surface. This finding is consistent with the previous observation that palmitoylation is not required for the transport of CM2 to the cell surface in CM2-expressing COS-1 cells. 13 However, the use of reverse-genetics system has enabled us to conclude that the palmitoylation of CM2 is required for efficient infectious virus production. This suggests that the significance of the other posttranslational modifications of CM2 during virus replication can be clarified using recombinant viruses lacking the respective modification sites.

Besides, cDNA array data of ex vivo infected human lung showed that both influenza H5N1 and H1N1 virus induced TRAIL expression compared with mock-infected tissue (approximately 15 folds) at 48 hours post infection, but influenza H3N2 virus infected lung induced significantly more TRAIL (27 folds compared to mock infected cells), albeit with a limited viral replication ( Figure 2 ). Influenza H3N2 virus infected lung also elicited more TNF-alpha and FasR transcription than either H5N1 or H1N1. These observations can account for the greater apoptotic response in influenza H3N2 virus infected lung.

Although there is no direct evidence supporting the occurrence of human-to-human transmission in these infection events or the association between viral virulence and receptor-binding switching, viral systemic disseminations are found in the both fatal cases (data not shown). Furthermore, with the introduction of clade 2AE3AE4 into the adjacent countries of China, 4 the finding of H5N1 virus with 2-6binding in human should be of concern. Though H5N1 virus with human-type receptor-binding was isolated from one patient treated by oseltamivir and those viruses were with HA and \u2044 or NA substitutions, 13 whether the substitutions responsible for receptor specificity switching is pre-existed or selected in human host remains unknown. Our finding that three mutant viruses bearing M2 mutations of A30S, A30T, and S31N cloned from one isolate A \u2044 HB \u2044 1 \u2044 06 suggested it is likely that the resistant viruses emerged in the host environment. No variation was found in their HA and NA sequence, and all of them show high affinity to a2-3-binding. Our data suggest that the binding-specificity was not affected by the mutations on viral envelope protein M2. With the adaptation from wild aquatic birds to domestic poultry or even in human host environment, influenza virus may possess broader carbohydrate-binding spectrum or topology conformation. 11, 14 We demonstrated differential a2, 6-binding property of two human H5N1 viruses, A \u2044 GD \u2044 1 \u2044 06 and A \u2044 GX \u2044 1 \u2044 08. Though minor effect of short-a2, 6-binding was detected in viruses A \u2044 GX \u2044 1 \u2044 08 at low virus titer, both were of high affinity to long-a2, 6 glycans, even at the low titer which are rich on apical side of human upper respiratory epithelia. 11 Notably, no evident binding preference switching was detected in the viruses isolated from the sporadic human infection cases at the early of 2009 in China (Table 1) . However, higher affinity to the long-a2, 6 glycans was observed in BJ \u2044 1 \u2044 09, GZ \u2044 1 \u2044 09, and XJ \u2044 1 \u2044 09 (data not shown). The discrepancy from the findings obtained by sialidase-treated CRBC maybe associated with a limited abundance of N-linked a2-6 with long branches on CRBC, as demonstrated in a recent study. 11 Therefore, glycan dose-dependent binding assay is valuable and should be applied in flu surveillance. The underlying cause of the tendency is unknown, and further research on receptor-binding specificity of H5N1 viruses is required.",

In particular, the rapid and sensitive detection of influenza A and B viruses and subtyping of new A(H1N1) 2009 is critical for the determination of the spread and extent of new virus and to define the epidemiological picture of circulating strains. This article describes the performance of a rapid and sensitive real-time PCR-based protocol including three primer-and-probe sets with the same amplification profile: A) amplifying a conserved region of the matrix (M) gene from all influenza A viruses; B) designed to specifically detect the NP gene segment from lineage Yamagata-and Victoria-lineage B viruses, and A(H1N1) 2009, designed to specifically detect the M gene segment from A(H1N1) 2009. In our experience, the new protocol is more sensitive than the WHO \u2044 CDC assays, showing 1-2 log 10 lower detection limit in detecting A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H1N1) 2009, and B viruses. The higher sensitivity of the new protocol was confirmed by clinical sensitivity data: 31AE1% out of low titre A(H1N1)",

Such information should be aimed at diverse communities and retaining public trust. The experience of the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 highlighted the need to strengthen risk and strategic communication by bringing together expertise from relevant fields, including anthropology, marketing, communication, broadcasting, media research, as well as the behavioral and social sciences. The World Health Organization (WHO) received requests from many Member States asking for technical assistance on evidence-based communication strategies and approaches to support public health policy development. To respond to these acute needs, in 2009, the Global Influenza Programme (GIP) organized a global consultation to initiate the development and implementation of a WHO Public Health Research Agenda for Influenza. 1 Outcomes of the discussions highlighted strategic \u2044 risk communication as one of its pivotal cross-cutting areas that requires further development. GIP convened a workshop on ''Modern Tools for Strategic Communication'' in May 2010 to address these needs.",

This primary analysis studies the association between elevated haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers against A \u2044 H1N1v and influenza vaccination (seasonal or pandemic) at entry in the cohort. Inclusions began on December 4, 2009 and ended on July 23, 2010. Households were sampled using a random telephonic design in French general population. All household members were eligible to the cohort; however the inclusion of a household required the participation of all members. During the inclusion visits, nurses collected detailed data on subjects as well as blood samples. A standard HAI technique was adapted to the detection and quantification of antibodies to the 2009 A \u2044 H1N1v virus. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) were calculated for HAI assays with the use of generalized estimating equations for interval-censored data, and a ''GMT ratio'' (GMTR) was defined as the multiplicative factor applied to the GMT in presence of an explanatory variable.This preliminary analysis included 1304 subjects belonging to 544 households.The GMT in the population was 35AE4 [95% CI: 30AE1; 41AE8]. This GMT varied among age classes with values of 52AE6 [39AE2; 70AE6], 28AE5 [21AE2; 38AE3], and 38AE3 [33AE1; 44AE5] for subjects below 15, between15  and 50, and over 50, respectively. The other factors associated to an elevated GMT were previous vaccination by either the pandemic or the seasonal strain and history of influenza-like illness (ILI) since the beginning of the epidemic. In pandemic vaccine recipients, the GMT decreased after vaccination (GMTR: 0AE89 [0AE81; 0AE99]) per month since pandemic vaccination.",

Infants had less risk of getting sick in relation to the rest of the population (RR 0AE40 [95% CI 0AE33-0AE47]) (P < 0AE05). There was no significant difference between both sexes. The highest proportion of cases resided in the Capital (52% [937 \u2044 1798]) and Cruz Alta(14% [255 \u2044 1798]). The symptoms, which were significantly different (P < 0AE05) in the confirmed cases with the rest of the population, were fever, migraine, myalgia, sore throat and cough, in that order. The highest proportion of comorbidity reported was ROBS(8% [151 \u2044 1798]). The chance of SARI in infants under 5 years old was 2AE89 (95% CI 2AE46-3AE39) compared to the rest of the population. The highest rate of SARI for IA was observed in infants under 1 year old (180 \u2044 100 000 people) (Table 1). In infants under 5 years old the chance of SARI for IA was important if they had a previous illness (OR 4AE97 [95% CI 3AE45-7AE20]).

Objectives We aimed to investigate the usefulness of B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90 as a donor to generate high yield B reassortants. B \u2044 Brisbane \u2044 60 \u2044 2008, a recommended vaccine virus for 2009 \u2044 10-2010 \u2044 11 seasons, was used as a wild type (wt) ''target'' strain for potential use as a seed virus for influenza B vaccine production. We also incorporated B \u2044 Lee \u2044 40 NP gene (a previously known ''high yield gene'') into one of the resultant high yield reassortant for further enhancement of the virus yield. Materials and methods B reassortant viruses were prepared by the classical reassortment method. The anti-B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90 HANA antibodies were used for the selection of wt surface antigen carrying viruses. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) was used for genotyping of resultant reassortants. Results Reassortants with significantly higher yield than the parental vaccine strain were produced in this reassortment between B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90 and B \u2044 Brisbane \u2044 60 \u2044 2008. RT-PCR \u2044 RFLP analysis revealed that all the high yield reassortants contained the PB2 of B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90, suggesting that the high yield property of B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90 was donated to the reassortant viruses by PB2. One of the resultant high yield reassortants, NYMC BX-33B, was further reassorted with B \u2044 Lee \u2044 40 to introduce its NP gene for further enhancement of virus yield. The resultant triple reassortant, NYMC BX-35, has been utilized as a seed virus for influenza B vaccine production for the 2010 \u2044 11 season. Conclusions A Yamagata lineage strain, B \u2044 Panama \u2044 45 \u2044 90, was useful for developing high yield reassortants of B \u2044 Brisbane \u2044 60 \u2044 2008. NYMC BX-33, BX-33B, and BX-35 developed in this study were candidate viruses for the 2010 \u2044 11 Northern Hemisphere vaccine.",

Lipkin, b Chris Myers, c Patrick Blair c , Robert Kuschner a Introduction Novel 2009 influenza A (H1N1) is a flu virus of swine origin that was first detected in Mexico and the United States in March and April 2009. 1-3 Since its initial identification and the announcement of the unusual human outbreaks in Mexico, the 2009 swine H1N1 virus quickly spread north into the United States, mostly via spring break tourists traveling to and from Mexico (MMWR). 4 Following Mexico and US reported cases, confirmed out-breaks of 2009 swine H1N1 were reported throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, most probably via global airline travel. 5,6 Based on up-to-date viral sequence comparisons (GenBank) from various laboratories worldwide, it was clear that not all deposited 2009 swine H1N1 sequences were 100% identical. 7,8 It was uncertain if specific and significant mutations had occurred in viral genomes since the initial infections in Mexico. 9 In this study, we utilized a robust and constant 2009 H1N1-specific RT-PCR amplification scheme in conjunction to Roche 454 FLX system to accomplish a large number of full genome sequences of various clinical samples containing moderate to low viral (2009 H1N1) concentrations collected worldwide.

Influenza A virus has eight genomic segments (segment 1-8) with varying lengths from about 890 to 2341 nucleotides. The subtypes of influenza A viruses are named by combining the serotypes of their surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). To date, 16 HA (H1 through H16) and 9 NA (N1 through N9) serotypes have been identified. Influenza A virus causes zoonotic diseases in various hosts, such as human, pig, bird, horse, seal, whale, and dog. As a segmented, negative-stranded RNA virus, influenza A virus is characterized by its rapid mutation and frequent reassortment. A reassortment event refers to the exchange of gene segments between co-infected influenza viruses, and it has facilitated the emergence of 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strains. 1,2",

Genetic profile analysis was performed in 37 isolates to the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and MP genes, and in six of these isolates the PB1, PB2, PA, NP and NS genes were also analysed. Antiviral drug susceptibility profile was analysed for 96 isolates, phenotypically and genotypically to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) and genotypically to amantadine. The point mutations identified in HA, NA, and MP genes of different strains do not seem to evidence an evolutionary trend. This is in agreement with the genetic and antigenic homogeneity that has being described for A(H1N1) 2009 virus. All analysed strains were found to be resistant to amantadine, and five of these strains exhibited a reduced susceptibility profile to NAI, three only for oseltamivir and two for both inhibitors.",

It is important to understand the patterns of viral shedding and symptoms over time in community-based infections.Materials and methods: Household infections were followed-up in two large community-based studies. Patterns of viral shedding, symptoms and signs, and tympanic temperature were plotted over time and grouped according to strain for analysis.Results: The patterns of viral shedding, symptoms and signs, and tympanic temperature in three influenza A strains (pandemic A \u2044 H1N1, seasonal A \u2044 H1N1, and seasonal A \u2044 H3N2) were comparable. Peak viral shedding occurred close to the onset of symptoms and resolved after 6-7 days. Patterns of viral shedding in influenza B virus infections differed.Discussion: The patterns of viral shedding and clinical course of pandemic influenza A \u2044 H1N1 infections were broadly similar to seasonal influenza A \u2044 H1N1 and A \u2044 H3N2. Only the clinical course of seasonal influenza B infections was similar to pandemic influenza A \u2044 H1N1. The dynamics of pandemic influenza A \u2044 H1N1 were observed to be largely alike to the dynamics of seasonal influenza A \u2044 H1N1 and A \u2044 H3N2.",

Further characterisation was performed through sequence analysis and the HA inhibition (HAI) assay. 8 Sequence analysis was performed using DNAStar 8 and all sequences obtained were compared with the sequence of either the original clinical specimen if available or the conventional ATCC derived MDCK cell isolate. The HAI assay was used to characterize the viruses against a panel of known standard reference viruses and their homologous ferret antiserum.Options for the control of influenza VII Abstract Background: We measured the cross-reactive antibody response to pandemic H1N1 2009 in children and adults before and after vaccination with [2007] [2008] [2008] [2009] influenza season vaccines as part of the rapid public health response to the emergence of pH1N1 and to provide evidence for pH1N1 vaccination policy development in mainland China. Materials and methods: Archived serum specimens from previous vaccine studies were detected by Hemagglutination inhibition assay. Results: Limited crossreactive antibody response to pH1N1 had been detected among participants of all age groups before and after they had been vaccinated with 2007-2008, 2008-2009 influenza seasonal vaccines. Vaccination with seasonal influenza viruses resulted in limited seroconversion to pH1N1 in all age groups, compared with 59-94% of seroconversion to seasonal influenza viruses. But similar to recent studies, a peak of cross-reactive antibody response to pH1N1 was observed in 23% and 39% of participants born from 1915 to 1925 before and after vaccination. Conclusions: In order to protect our populations in China, our study strongly suggests vaccination with pH1N1 is required in all age groups and that older populations born before 1925 may be associated with a lower infection rate of pH1N1.",

In this period, rather high incidence of lethality from pneumonia was observed, which developed on the background of the pandemic flu H1N1v. Thus, we received from BVLs 173 postmortem materials from 91 deceased patients which manifested PCR+ influenza H1N1v-specific RNA. All materials were tested for a possibility of isolation of influenza virus H1N1v both in eggs and in MDCK cells. PCR-negative materials were discarded. We isolated 229 strains of pandemic influenza from the materials collected in St. Petersburg and region, which comprised 29AE7% of the total number of analyzed samples. At the same time, we did not isolate any other sub-types of influenza in the season 2009-2010 except the pandemic flu. From the swabs purchased from BVLs, 47 strains were isolated, which compose 37AE9% of the PCR+ samples, and 35 strains from the post-mortem materials (43AE2% of the PCR+ samples).Altogether in the season 2009-2010, we isolated, retrieved, and analyzed in HAI 453 influenza strains. 91AE2% of them were pandemic strains A(H1N1)v, and only 7AE9% influenza B viruses. These data together with the epidemiologic data and the results of PCR-diagnostic provide evidence in favor of nearly mono-etiological character of epidemic season 2009-2010 in Russia for pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v.Though the isolation of pandemic viruses was fulfilled in two traditional model systems, in the case of pandemic 2009 virus, we could observe the tendency of preferential multiplication in embryos compared to MDCK, especially in cases of post-mortem material for which chicken embryos are the preferential system of isolation.H1N1v viruses, which were isolated and passaged in MDCK, even with significant HA titers, quickly lost their HA activity provided they were kept at +4\u00b0C.

In the course of isolation of viruses in the reported period, we produced rat polyclonal antisera to the strains A \u2044 California \u2044 07 \u2044 09 and A \u2044 St. Petersburg \u2044 56 \u2044 09 (H1N1)v and the antisera to the strains A \u2044 New Jersey \u2044 8 \u2044 76 -the virus isolated during the epidemic 1976 in the United States and also of the swine origin -and to the 'swine' strains A \u2044 SW \u2044 1976 \u2044 31 and A \u2044 Iowa \u2044 15 \u2044 30. The HAI results of representative strains are given in Figure 1 . Table 1 shows that the isolated strains were homogenous in their antigenic properties and interacted with the diagnostic antiserum CDC for A(H1N1)v and also with the antisera to the strains A \u2044 California \u2044 07 \u2044 09 and A \u2044 St. Petersburg \u2044 56 \u2044 09 up to 1-1 \u2044 4 homologous titer. Viruses that were isolated from post-mortem materials did not differ by their antigenic characteristics from those isolated from swabs of live patients. Only two strains could be attributed to the drift-variants of the strain A \u2044 California \u2044 07 \u2044 09 because they reacted with the appropriate antiserum up to 1 \u2044 8 homologous titer; these strains were A \u2044 Pskov \u2044 1 \u2044 09 and A \u2044 Belgorod \u2044 6 \u2044 09. It is interesting that the isolated strains reacted with the antisera to the strains A \u2044 New Jersey \u2044 8 \u2044 76 and A \u2044 SW \u2044 1976 \u2044 31 to 1 \u2044 4-1 \u2044 8, and some particular strains even to 1 \u2044 2 homologous titer. It is even more interesting that some pandemic isolates reacted with the antiserum to the strain Iowa isolated in 1930 up to 1 \u2044 4-1 \u2044 8 homologous titer. Despite of the fact that since the outbreak of 'swine flu' in the USA in New Jersey 30 years had gone (and for the strain Iowa this period is nearly 70 years) the HA of these viruses and of the pandemic influenza 2009 share some common antigenic determinants as was shown in HAI.One more interesting feature of a considerable part of isolated strains is their capability to react with high titers with normal equine serum heated to 56 and to 80\u00b0C, while all the strains of swine origin isolated earlier were inhibitor-resistant ( Figure 1 ). Russian isolates of 2009 divided, in this respect, in two clear and approximately equal in number groups: one of them is similar to the reference strain amino acid substitutions, among them more than 30 were disclosed in antigenic sites, so the degree of similarity to this strain is 78%. A new site of glycosylation was also discovered in the position 276 of HA. 4 Essential distinctions of the aminoacid sequence of HA and antigenic properties of the H1N1v strains as compared with actual circulating and vaccine strains is one of the factors that determine the pandemic potential of this new influenza virus.According to the literature, the mutation in the HA gene D222G could cause a broadening of the spectrum of receptor specificity of influenza virus by the acquisition of the capacity to bind both the residues a(2 fi 6) and a(2 fi 3) of the sialic acid of cellular receptors. 5 Both types of receptors are present at the human respiratory tract, but in different parts of it, and they exist in different proportions. 6 According to the data of the European Center of Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the varieties G222 of the H1N1v virus were isolated in 20 countries from subjects deceased of influenza or who suffered a severe form of illness, as well as from those who sustained only a light course of influenza. 7 Concerning the strains isolated in RII, this mutation was discovered in nine cases: four were isolated from live patients and five from post-mortem materials. Thus, there are no convincing data at present that could prove a causal relationship of the given substitution and the aggravation of a disease course. This is in accordance with previous observations. 7 Concerning the resistance of studied strains to the widely used antiviral preparations, it was shown that all tested strains possessed the substitution S31N in the M2 protein that determine the resistance to adamantanes. There was no substitution in the position 275 of neuraminidase (NA), which determines the resistance to oseltamivir (H275Y). These substitutions are the characteristic indices of the Eurasian lineage of swine influenza viruses. 8 Thus all studied Russian H1N1v isolates were resistant to adamantanes (rimantadine) and sensitive to oseltamivir.",

            "text": "Both the a2, 6 linkage and its topology on target cells were critical for human adaptation of influenza A viruses. The binding preference of avian flu virus H5N1 HA to the a2, 3-linked sialylated glycans is considered the major factor that limited its efficient infection in human. Currently, the switch in binding-specificity of human H5N1 viruses from a2, 3 to a2, 6-glycans did naturally occur, and limited humanto-human transmission was found. To monitor their potential adaptation in the human population, receptor-binding specificity surveillance was made in China. Here, the binding specificity of 32 human H5N1 virus strains isolated from 2003 to 2009 was demonstrated. Dual binding preference to a2, 3 and a2, 6-glycans were found in A \u2044 Guangdong \u2044 1 \u2044 06 and A \u2044 Guangxi \u2044 1 \u2044 08. Furthermore, both of them showed a high affinity to the long-branched a2, 6-glycans, which predominate on the upper respiratory epithelial in human. Our data suggests that the existence of H5N1 virus with binding specificity to humans should be of concern.Introduction Via envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA), influenza viruses bind to cell-surface glycosylated oligosaccharides terminated by sialic acids (SA) where their linkage is celland species-specific. Differential receptor binding preference is a host barrier for influenza virus transmission. Although most H5N1 viruses have low affinity to Neu5Aca2, 6Gal (human-type) receptor, recent findings suggested that the adaptation of H5N1 virus to human by mutations in the receptor-binding site (RBS) do indeed happen and resulted in enhanced affinity to human-type receptor. [1] [2] [3] In contrast to its putative precursor, A \u2044 Gs \u2044 GD \u2044 1 \u2044 96, diverse genotypes were presented in currently circulating H5N1 virus, accelerating evolution and widespread occurrence. 4, 5 To date, 10 distinct phylogenetic clades (0-9) were identified based on H5N1 HA, and the confirmed human infections were caused by clade 0, 1, 2AE1, 2AE2, 2AE3, and 7. 6 In China, human H5N1 disease was mostly caused by clade2AE3AE4, which was identified in 28 isolates from 39 confirmed patients from 17 provinces since 2003. Clade 7 and clade 2AE2 are responsible for the case in 2003 and 2006, respectively. Two current cases of 2009 and 2010 were due to clade 2AE3AE2. Now information on receptor property has been documented in some H5N1 viruses of clade 1, 2AE1, and 2AE2. [1] [2] [3] 7 Little is known about H5N1 virus of clade 2AE3AE4, particularly from human.Recently, a2, 3-specific sialidase-treated red blood cell (RBC) agglutination assay was developed and used for receptor specificity screening of H5N1 virus. 3, 8 The a2, 6 or a2, 3-binding preference can be distinguished by the change of hemagglutination titer reacted with RBCs and enzymatic RBCs. Since fine receptor specificity existed in H5N1 viruses, 9,10 the glycan array including sulfated-, fucosylated-, linear sialosides, di-sialosides, or direct binding assay with synthetic polyacrylamide (PAA)-based sialylglycopolymers was also recommended for the receptor-specificity surveillance on H5N1 viruses. Furthermore, the long-branched a2, 6 sialylated glycans were currently identified to predominate on the upper respiratory epithelial in human and the recognition of this topology, 6\u00a2SLN-LN is the key determinant for the human-adaptation of influenza A virus. 11 Here, we analyzed the receptor-binding specificity of human H5N1 viruses isolated in China from 2003 to 2009.",
