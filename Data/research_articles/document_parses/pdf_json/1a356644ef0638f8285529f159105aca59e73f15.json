It is assumed that wearing such masks reduces the likelihood for an infected person to spread the disease, but many of these mask designs have not been tested in practice. We have applied a simple optical measurement method to evaluate the efficacy of masks to reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets during regular speech. We compare a variety of commonly available mask types and observe that some mask types approach the performance of standard surgical masks, while some mask alternatives, such as neck fleece or bandanas, offer very little protection. Our measurement setup is inexpensive and can be built and operated by non-experts, allowing for rapid evaluation of mask performance during speech, sneezing, or coughing.",

            "text": "In general, the term 'face mask' governs a wide range of protective equipment with the primary function of reducing the transmission of particles or droplets. The most common application in modern medicine is to provide protection to the wearer (e.g. first responders), but surgical face masks were originally introduced to protect surrounding persons from the wearer, such as protecting patients with open wounds against infectious agents from the surgical team [3] , or the persons surrounding a tuberculosis patient from contracting the disease via airborne droplets [4] . This latter role has been embraced by multiple governments and regulatory agencies [5] , since COVID-19 patients can be asymptomatic but contagious for many days [6] . The premise of protection from infected persons wearing a mask is simple: wearing a face mask will reduce the spread of respiratory droplets containing viruses. In fact, recent studies suggest that wearing face masks reduces the spread of COVID-19 on a population level, and consequently blunts the growth of the epidemic curve [7, 8] . Still, determining mask efficacy is a complex topic that is still an active field of research (see for example [9] ), made even more complicated because the infection pathways for are not yet fully understood and are complicated by many factors such as the route of transmission, correct fit and usage of masks, and environmental variables. From a public policy perspective, shortages in supply for surgical face masks and N95 respirators, as well as concerns about their side effects and the discomfort of prolonged use [10] , have led to public use of a variety of solutions which are generally less restrictive (such as homemade cotton masks or bandanas), but usually of unknown efficacy. While some textiles used for mask fabrication have been characterized [11] , the performance of actual masks in a practical setting needs to be considered. The work we report here reflects a first attempt to improve evaluation; such results could be used to guide mask selection and purchase decisions.",

The required hardware for these measurements is commonly available; suitable lasers and optical components are accessible in hundreds of research laboratories or can be purchased for less than $200, and a standard cell phone camera can serve as a recording device. While we do not attempt a comprehensive survey of all possible mask designs, important general characteristics of face masks can be extracted. The experimental setup is simple and can easily be built and operated by non-experts. The described method allows for a relative comparison between different face masks and their transmission of droplets.",

Data points and error bars represent the mean value and distribution standard deviation, respectively, of the total droplet count normalized to the control trial (no mask). For our control trial, the absolute droplet count was around 960. We measured a droplet transmission fraction ranging from 5% (surgical mask) to 110% (fleece mask, see discussion below) relative to the control trial. In Fig. 3 (B) , the time evolution of detected droplets is shown for three representative examples (one of the cotton masks, the bandana, and the control trial)the data for all tested masks is shown in Supplementary Figure S1 . The solid curves indicate the droplet transmission rate over time. For the control trial (green curve), the five distinct peaks correspond to the five repetitions of the operator speaking.

The effect of the cotton mask (blue curve) is much stronger. The speech pattern is no longer recognizable and most of the droplets, compared to the control trial, are suppressed.

Considering that smaller particles are airborne longer than large droplets (larger droplets sink faster), the use of such a mask might be counterproductive. Furthermore, the performance of the N95 mask is likely affected by the exhalation valve, which opens for strong outwards airflow. While the valve does not compromise the protection of the wearer, it can decrease protection of persons surrounding the wearer.",

To estimate the sensitivity, we consider the light that is scattered by droplets passing through the laser beam. The amount of light scattered into the camera direction depends on the wavelength of light, the refractive index of the droplet, and its size (and shape). To estimate the light scattering of droplets into the camera as a function of their diameter we used the Python package PyMieScatt [12] , which is an implementation of Lorenz-Mie theory (see [13] for a review). The result is visualized in Fig. 4 . Panel (A) shows an example of the scattering distribution for 532 nm light scattered from a droplet of 5 \u03bcm diameter and a refractive index of water (n=1.33). In this example, the particle size is substantially bigger than the wavelength of the light (the so-called Mie regime). Almost all the light is scattered into the forward direction (0\u00b0) and very little into the direction of the camera (indicated by the shaded green cone around 90\u00b0). For the given camera acceptance angle, we display in Fig. 4 (B) the estimated number of photons per frame scattered into the cell phone camera aperture as a function of particle diameter. By illuminating the camera directly with an attenuated laser beam of known power, we determine the detection sensitivity. A minimum of about 75 photons (on a single camera pixel) or about 960 photons (spread over several pixels) per frame were required for the camera to detect a droplet (for details on the detection characterization, see the supplementary materials). Both detection thresholds are indicated by horizontal black lines in and the red shaded area in Fig. 4 (B) . The more conservative detection threshold corresponds to a minimum detectable droplet size of 0.5 \u00b5m. The main limitation is the low collection efficiency of our small camera aperture -we currently capture only 0.01% of the full solid angle. An increased collection efficiency is possible with a larger relay lens in front of the camera, but this would come at the cost of a reduced field of view.",

This makes it unfeasible to directly measure the size of small (aerosol) droplets in our setup. However, while we cannot measure the size of droplets at or below the pixel resolution, we can still detect and count the smaller droplets, down to the sensitivity limit described above. For very large particles, the limited dynamic range of the camera also poses a challenge for determining the size, since pixels easily saturate and hence distort the shape of the recorded droplet. We want to point out that neither the limited pixel resolution nor the saturation affect the particle counts presented in Fig. 3 . Choosing a higher quality camera and a smaller field of view, combined with a funnel setup to guide droplets towards the imaging area, would reduce the minimum observable size; so would approaches which use camera arrays to improve resolution without sacrificing sensitivity or field of view [14] . Keeping in mind these sizing limitations, we can still estimate the size distribution for the larger droplets (see supplementary figure S2 for a qualitative size plot), which presents some interesting observations such as the fleece performance mentioned earlier.",

This method can also test masks under other conditions, like coughing or sneezing. Improvements to the setup can increase sensitivity, yet testing efficiency during regular breathing likely will require complementing measurements with a conventional particle sizer. A further area of interest is the comparison of mask performance between solid particles and droplets, motivated by the observed liquid droplet breakup in the neck fleece and mask saturation by droplets, necessitating exchange in regular clinical practice.",

To form the light sheet, a cylindrical lens transformed a green laser beam into an elliptical profile, which was directed through the enclosure. The laser source was a scientific pump laser (Millennia, Spectra-Physics; power 2 W, wavelength 532 nm), but suitable green lasers of similar powers are available for less than US $100; the scientific lasers have better specifications (higher beam pointing and intensity stability, better beam profile), but these advantages are irrelevant in this application. The light sheet at the center of the enclosure had a thickness of 4.4 mm and a vertical size of 78 mm (Gaussian 1/e 2 intensity beam widths). The enclosure (L x W x H: 30 cm x 30 cm x 35 cm) was constructed out of (or lined with) black material to minimize stray light. The sides of the box had slits for entry and exit of the light sheet.

In order to clear droplets from the box between experiments, laminar HEPA-filtered air was continuously fed into the box from above through a duct of cross section 25 cm x 25 cm. The supplied air was being expelled through the light sheet slits and the speaker hole. A slight positive pressure in the box cleared droplets and prevented dust from entering into the box from outside. On the back of the box, a cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S9) was mounted at a distance of 20 cm from the light sheet.

Furthermore, for the masks that showed substantial amounts of detected particles (knitted, cotton, fleece, and bandana), we conducted additional tests by repeatedly puffing air from a bulb through the masks, rather than speech from an experimenter.

From all videos, we removed a weak background that originated from the light sheet itself and from stray light and diffuse reflections from the experimenter's face. We then binarized all frames with a common threshold that discriminates between scattered light from droplets and background signal and/or noise. Then, a feature detection algorithm is applied to each frame, which returns the center of mass positions, and major axis and minor axis length of the best-fit ellipse for every droplet. Note that the major and minor axis returned by the algorithm are not a direct measure of the droplet size, but a measurement of the amount of light scattered by the particle into the camera aperture (binary diameter).

We attribute this increase to the neck fleece dispersing larger droplets into several smaller droplets, therefore increasing the droplet count.
