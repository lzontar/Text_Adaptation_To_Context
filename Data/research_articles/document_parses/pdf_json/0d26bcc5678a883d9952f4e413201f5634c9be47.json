Current guidelines have not yet included standardization or guidance for diuretic-based de-resuscitation in critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a multi-disciplinary protocol for diuresis-guided de-resuscitation in the critically ill. Methods: This was a pre-post single-center pilot study within the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a large academic medical center. Adult patients admitted to the Medical ICU receiving mechanical ventilation with either (1) clinical signs of volume overload via chest radiography or physical exam or (2) any cumulative fluid balance \u2265 0 mL since hospital admission were eligible for inclusion. Patients received diuresis per clinician discretion for a 2-year period (historical control) followed by a diuresis protocol for 1 year (intervention). Patients within the intervention group were matched in a 1:3 ratio with those from the historical cohort who met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: A total of 364 patients were included, 91 in the protocol group and 273 receiving standard care. Protocolized diuresis was associated with a significant decrease in 72-h post-shock cumulative fluid balance [median, IQR \u2212 2257 (\u2212 5676-920) mL vs 265 (\u2212 2283-3025) mL; p < 0.0001]. In-hospital mortality in the intervention group was lower compared to the historical group (5.5% vs 16.1%; p = 0.008) and higher ICU-free days (p = 0.03). However, no statistically significant difference was found in ventilator-free days, and increased rates of hypernatremia and hypokalemia were demonstrated. Conclusions: This study showed that a protocol for diuresis for de-resuscitation can significantly improve 72-h post-shock fluid balance with potential benefit on clinical outcomes.",

It is possible that the implication of volume de-resuscitation seen in the current study could be casually linked with mortality, in line with a vast number of previous studies demonstrating the impact of fluid status on survival rates aside of its effect on ventilator days; however, this study can only show correlation given the nature of its design. Particularly, patients in the intervention group also had a decrease in RRT dependence at discharge.

In regard to rates of hypernatremia, providers were permitted to request continuation of furosemide despite elevated sodium levels, likely resulting in the subsequent increased rate of metolazone use in the intervention group. There was a significant difference in cumulative fluid balance that was likely due to higher furosemide exposure in the intervention group, as demonstrated in previous protocols of furosemide in acute kidney injury [10] . The significant increase in episodes of hypernatremia and hypokalemia are predictable and reversible within this strategy. If replicated in future randomized trials, improvements in ICU length of stay and mortality may take precedence over concern for electrolyte abnormalities. Future protocol designs should account for these episodes of hypernatremia and hypokalemia with creation of more explicit electrolyte replacement rules.

A pre-and post-intervention study was chosen given the lack of blinding. It was anticipated that an overall change in practice may occur over the study timeframe given increased awareness of the detrimental effects of fluid overload and approach to diuretic dosing in critically ill patients, a phenomenon recently found in management of septic shock [22, 23] . However, given the limited time lapse between the historical group and protocol implementation and lack of emergence of guidelines regarding volume de-resuscitation, changes in overall approaches to care based on external factors were unlikely. To limit potential bias further, patients were matched on a large number of relevant variables and objective outcome measures were utilized, with the exception of the DRG weight. However, the authors opted for inclusion of this variable versus International Classification of Disease coding given its consideration for up to eight diagnoses, including the primary diagnosis, and up to six procedures performed during the stay, likely increasing its objectiveness versus retrospective chart review. Regardless, it is still possible for potential residual confounders on illness severity to have been missed. Given that volume overload and positive fluid balance may be markers of severity of illness rather than a parameter for early diuresis intervention, the differences in mortality and length of stay must be replicated in a larger, randomized controlled trial for confirmation. Worth nothing, true blinding in a randomized controlled trial would likely be unfeasible by nature of the protocol design and a parallel design could subject the trial to potential for a significant Hawthorne effect.",

We evaluated 72-h net cumulative fluid balance in accordance with previous literature; however, evidence suggests that fluid balance documentation is not always accurate. The utilization of EHR flowsheets decreases potential for error in ICU documentation. The frequency in documentation required via the protocol aligns with standard of care within the ICU. Recent studies have challenged the validity of net cumulative fluid balance in the ICU and its relationship to body weight or clinical signs of fluid overload [26, 27] . Because this practice is not tightly protocolized, we did not utilize body weight as a monitoring parameter. However, it is possible that This study demonstrated that a pharmacist-driven diuresis protocol of volume de-resuscitation was significantly associated with a lower cumulative fluid balance at 72 h post-shock. The addition of the diuresis protocol was likely effective for a multitude of reasons, including the overall increased awareness of avoidance of volume overload and tailored diuresis utilization, the standardization of doses and follow-up monitoring, as well as an increase in furosemide dosing as demonstrated in this study. However, with increased dosing of furosemide, increased rates of adverse events were found, namely hypernatremia and hypokalemia. Risk versus benefit of active volume de-resuscitation and electrolyte fluctuations must be considered. The increased mortality and decreased number of ICU-free days in the standard therapy group are hypothesis-generating, particularly given the lack of difference between-groups in ventilator-free days.",

Although this study supports the implementation of a diuresis protocol in the ICU, larger randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm or refute the potential benefits of de-resuscitation, through protocol-driven diuresis, on important patient centered outcomes, such as ICU length of stay, ventilator-free days, and in-hospital mortality, as suggested by observed associations in the present study.",
