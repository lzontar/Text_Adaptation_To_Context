Correct IAP measurement therefore is crucial. The gold standard measurement method via a bladder catheter first described by Kron poses the risk for infection and needle-stick injury and interferes with urinary output estimations [1] . Cheatham and Safcsak reported a revision of Kron's technique limiting these risks but still interfering with urinary output estimation [2] . All these measurements also interfere with nursing time and cannot be done without manipulation of the Foley catheter. A technique for measuring IAP using the patient's own urine as transmitting medium has been described previously [1] . The aim of this study is to validate IAP measurement via two prototypes (Holtech Medical, Kopenhagen, Denmark) using this technique. A 50 ml container fitted with a bio-filter for venting is inserted between the Foley catheter and the drainage bag. The container fills with urine during drainage; when the container is elevated, the 50 ml urine flows back into the patient's bladder, and IAP can be read from the position of the meniscus in the clear manometer tube between the container and the Foley catheter. The first prototype consisted of a 50 ml plastic bag with a bio-filter, inserted between the Foley catheter and the urine collection bag; a major drawback was occasional blocking of the bio-filter, leading to overestimation of IAP in some cases. Another drawback was the occasional presence of air-bubbles in Elevated intraabdominal pressure and the abdominal compartment syndrome seem to be the recent hype at critical care conferences.

Endpoint for the assessment of therapeutic effects of an intervention like PPV is generally the mortality rate. The aim of our study is to attempt to analyze the discrepancy between positive effects of prone position ventilation on oxygenation index in ARF and the comparatively high mortality rates despite of this intervention. We studied 110 consecutive patients with ALI (n = 18) and ARDS (n = 92) at mean age 66 \u00b1 13 [SE] years in a clinical follow-up design at a surgical ICU in a university hospital, who met the criteria of the American European consensus definition. All patients were ventilated intermittent in SP and in PP (135\u00b0l eft/right-side-position) for at least 6 hours/day. Data collection included apart from baseline characteristics individual oxygenation index and underlying diseases of the patients, in particular if of benign or malignant nature. We compared individual oxygenation index (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) before and after start of prone position (SPSS \u00ae T-test) and the data set of each patient with outcome. PPV was well tolerated in all n = 110 patients and showed an significant increase of PaO 2 /FiO 2 in n = 106 within the first 6 hours (SP 149 \u00b1 0.52 vs PP 230 \u00b1 0.73 mmHg [mean \u00b1 SEM]). In the remaining four cases there was a positive effect within the first 24 hours. Sixty-seven (61%) of the patients died in the course of intensive care therapy and 43 (39%) survived. Seven died with an oxygenation index below 100, another 36 with a ratio below 200, 17 below 300 and seven above 300 mmHg. Patients with a malignant underlying disease as cofactor had a 1.8 times higher and those with sepsis a 3.15 times higher risk to die during their ICU-stay despite of PPV. Despite of positive effects of PPV on oxygenation in our patients a considerable part of them died. To our amazement oxygenation index previous to death was not the main problem for most part of the patients in that phase. Malignant diseases in history and sepsis during the ICU-stay seem to increase the risk to die in the course of ALI or ARDS regardless the use of PPV conspicuously. Our results show that for the assessment of a therapeutic intervention in acute respiratory failure not only mortality as an endpoint seems to be suitable, but also important clinical cofactors. Introduction: The morphological changes in the lungs in acute lung injury (ALI) often lead to high elevated inspiratory pressures and the use of high dosed toxic inspiratory O 2 -concentration. This requires an appropriate adaptation of the mechanical ventilation to reduce ventilation associated complications.

Depth of sedation was assessed with a modified Ramsay Score (UK Intensive Care Society National Guideline, 1999) and was also graded as light (L), desired level (D) or excessive (E). The 'Diprifusor' target blood propofol setting was titrated as required to obtain the depth of sedation desired in each patient. A desired level of sedation was obtained, after a mean time of 9.9 min, in all but one patient in whom sedation was 'excessive' throughout. For each patient, the time-weighted average target setting over the entire period of sedation, from the time when a desired level was first obtained, was calculated.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcome; however, the causal role of low serum albumin concentration and appropriateness of albumin therapy are controversial. We conducted a metaanalysis focusing on two types of evidence: (1) cohort studies with multivariate analysis capable of more accurately assessing whether serum albumin is a direct contributor to poor outcome rather than merely a marker for other pathological processes; and (2) controlled trials of albumin therapy for hypoalbuminemia reporting data on morbidity, which may afford a comparatively sensitive endpoint. The meta-analysis included 66 cohort studies with 171,654 total patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and seven prospective controlled trials with 449 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia. The pooled results of the included cohort studies revealed hypoalbuminemia to be a potent, dose-dependent, independent predictor of poor outcome. For each 10 g/l decline in serum albumin concentration the odds of mortality increased by 124% (OR, 2.24; CI, These effects were independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. In controlled trials, albumin therapy reduced complications in hypoalbuminemic patients (OR, 0.79; CI, 0.36-1.72), although the overall effect was not statistically significant. However, there was a strong and significant (P = 0.019) inverse relationship between morbidity and attained serum albumin level during therapy, which suggested that complication rate may be diminished by exogenous albumin sufficient to elevate serum albumin level above 30 g/l. The value of albumin therapy for hypoalbuminemia needs to be investigated further in well-designed trials. At present, the evidence suggesting a causal link between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome and a dose-dependent effect of exogenous albumin in reducing complications provides a logical basis for albumin therapy, and there appears to be no compelling argument for withholding albumin therapy if deemed clinically appropriate.

Therefore, we have tested the hypothesis that the beat-to-beat variation of the peak of velocity of blood in the descending aorta (PV Ao), measured by a transesophageal echo-doppler device (a less invasive monitoring technique using a small probe) was of the same degree as the beat-to-beat PP variation measured by an arterial catheter.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 340, "end": 343, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 453, "end": 456, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "In 12 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, the arterial pressure curve (arterial catheter) and the descending aorta velocity signal (transesophageal echo-doppler; HemoSonic100 -Arrow Intl.) have been recorded simultaneously on a computer allowing beat-to-beat analysis of the PP and PV Ao values.

The objective of our study was to find out whether intraoperative maintenance of at least normal values of cardiac output (i.e. 5-7 l/min) would influence postoperative outcome in a group of elective abdominal surgery patients. The reason to choose normal range of cardiac output as a therapeutic goal was the observation, that average values of intraoperatively measured cardiac output are frequently found in a range lower than normal values in a group of patients with unfavourable postoperative outcome [2] . * Fluid administration and in three patients also dopamine was used in management of hemodynamic instability.

Non-adherence to the therapy guidelines in prescribing was common, probably due to anxieties surrounding the perceived detrimental effects of steroids in early sepsis and lack of prescription review. To investigate the adrenocortical function in protracted critical illness, 43 patients (29 men and 14 women), having a mean (\u00b1 SD) age of 55 \u00b1 21 years were studied. First, a morning blood sample was obtained to determine baseline plasma cortisol. Subsequently, 1 \u00b5g of corticotropin (ACTH, synacthen) was injected intravenously and a second blood sample was drawn 30 min following the injection to measure stimulated plasma cortisol. Patients having a stimulated cortisol level of at least 18 \u00b5g/dl were defined as responders. In 36 patients, morning interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations were also measured. Mean baseline and stimulated plasma cortisol were 16.8 \u00b1 4.1 \u00b5/dl and 21.2 \u00b1 5.1 \u00b5g/dl respectively. The median increment in cortisol was 4.1 \u00b5g/dl. Median IL-6 was high (39.3 pg/ml, interquartile range 24.9-86.6 pg/ml). There was a negative correlation between IL-6 and stimulated plasma cortisol (r = -0.40, P = 0.01). Of the 43 patients, 31 patients (72%) were responders, and 12 patients (28%) were non-responders to the low-dose synacthen test. Non-responders had significantly higher IL-6 levels compared to responders (76.6 vs 37.3 pg/ml, P = 0.01). Overall, 18 patients died and 25 patients survived to hospital discharge. Non-survivors had significantly lower baseline (15.1 \u00b1 2.9 vs 18.0 \u00b1 4.5 \u00b5g/dl, P = 0.02) and stimulated (19.1 \u00b1 3.3 vs 23.0 \u00b1 5.6, P = 0.01) cortisol levels compared to survivors. In conclusion, patients with protracted critical illness may have an altered adrenal responsiveness to stimulation by ACTH.

Regarding documentation of DNR orders only 2.1% answered that their unit uses a specific document and 49.3% said that it is just transmitted orally to the working group. The same applies for withhold and withdraw treatment decisions, with 43.5% and 38.4% of the physicians answering that they are just transmitted orally. Probability of survival to the current episode and the patient wishes were the most important factors pointed out by the physicians that influence refusal of ICU admission, DNR orders and withhold or withdraw treatment decisions. Only 37.9% of the physicians said that a DNR order precedes a withdraw treatment decision. Eighty-two per cent continue or start comfort measures like morphine infusion, after a withdraw treatment decision is made.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Conclusions: End-of-life decisions are a current practice in the inquired Portuguese ICUs.

In a pilot study we examined whether changes in cytokine levels and leukocyte count correlate with the onset of complications and influence global quality of life.Material and methods: Patients (ASA class III and IV) with colorectal cancer were randomized in a double-blinded pilot study to: prophylaxis with G-CSF (12 hours before surgery, 12 and 36 hours after surgery) versus placebo. Measurements of G-CSF, IL-6, IL-18, Procalcitonin (PCT) in plasma, leukocyte count, percentage of polynuclear granulocytes (PMNs) and their phagocytic activity were started before operation and continued till day 6 after surgery. TNF-\u03b1 release was determined after LPS in vitro stimulation of whole blood. All complications were documented as well as quality of life (QL) at discharge, 2 and 6 months after surgery using the EORTC QLQ 30 questionnaire and for global QL the indexpoints of the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated.Results:In one patient of the placebo group surgery was cancelled after randomization (withdrawal). In all measurements IL-6 and IL-18 levels and the leukocyte count of the G-CSF group were above placebo and normal values. Only in the placebo group phagocytic activity of granulocytes fell below normal values. There was no difference between the groups regarding IL-8, PCT and TNF-\u03b1 release. All values were within normal range besides PCT. PCT values were elevated on day 1 after operation on average up to 1.9 and at day 3 on 1.2 ng/ml (normal <0.5 ng/ml). Patient 2 developed fever on day 5 after surgery and leukocytosis on the basis of an anastomotic leakage. Patient 4 had the highest IL-6 levels of all patients on day 6 and on day 8 a duodenal ulcer perforation. Patient 5 developed a bowel atony on day 5 and showed the highest IL-18 levels of all patients on day 6.Conclusions: The development of postoperative early phase complications is accompanied by changes of cytokine-and bloodcell patterns. Prophylactic treatment with G-CSF elevated IL-6 and IL-18 levels and improved phagocytic activity of granulocytes. The expected influence on global quality of life could not be demonstrated in the pilot study. The correlations found are being further examined in an ongoing randomized, double-blinded trial with 80 patients. Reference: 1.

We have recently observed that direct cellular effects of antithrombin are mediated by syndecan-4, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan known to bind to the heparin-binding site of antithrombin. Syndecan-4 is known to affect proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types. We have, therefore, studied direct effects of intact antithrombin on endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein and calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells were studied in the presence or absence of antithrombin concentrate or monoclonal antibody purified antithrombin with and without concomitant presence of synthetic pentasaccharide. Proliferation was assessed in BrDU incorporation and MTT assays. For testing endothelial cell differentiation, capillary tube formation was investigated in matrigel assays. Proliferation of the two types of endothelial was significantly inhibited by 1-10 U/ml of both antithrombin concentrate and antibody-purified antithrombin. Capillary tube formation induced by matrigel was augmented by the presence of 1-10 U/ml of antithrombin concentrate which was partly reversed with pentasaccharide. Results show that in vitro effects of antithrombin on angiogenesis-related endothelial cell functions may be directly exerted by the intact serpine and can be antagonised by pentasaccharideP120 Syndecan-4 on human peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes mediates effects of antithrombin on chemotaxis NC Kaneider, CM Reinisch, S Dunzendorfer, J R\u00f6misch, CJ Wiedermann Divison of General Internal Medicin, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Anichstrasse 35, A 6020 Innsbruck, Austria", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF22": {"text": "Evaluation of anti-inflammatory and anti-adhesive effects of heparins in human endotoxemia U Derhaschnig*, T Pernerstorfer \u2020 , B Jilma \u2020 *Department of Emergency Medicine, and \u2020 Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Vienna, Austria Introduction: Sepsis results from a generalized inflammatory and pro-coagulant response to an infectious agent.

A retrospective study performed at our hospital did not clarify the clinical and prognostic significance of HSV in the respiratory tract of critical care patients.Objectives: A prospective study was conducted between November 1999 and July 2001 in order to evaluate the incidence and significance of respiratory HSV in ICU patients, to identify risk factors for the development of lower respiratory tract (LRT) infections with HSV and to study the origin of the virus.P88 Efficacy and safety of sequential IV/PO moxifloxacin for the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia H Lode*, S Choudhri \u2020 , D Haverstock \u2020 , P Jackson \u2020 , D Church \u2020 *Lungenklinik Heckeshorn, Berlin, Germany; \u2020 Bayer Corp, West Haven, CT, USA Methods: Seven hundred and sixty-four patients admitted to our 30 bed ICU in a tertiary care hospital were examined for the presence of HSV in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT).Results:One hundred and sixty-nine patients (22%) had HSV in the URT. The reactivation of the virus occurred within 10 days for 89% of all positive patients and followed a period of more severe disease as was indicated by SOFA max. In 58 (16.2%) of the 361 patients who had their LRT sampled, the virus was isolated from bronchusaspirate (BA) of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BAL). HSV in the throat was a highly significant risk factor (RR 11.6; 95% CI 5.51-23.84) for the development of LRT infections with the virus. Patients with more debilitating disease on admission and during ICU stay were more susceptible for HSV reactivation as was shown by APACHE II and SOFA scores. There was a significant association between HSV reactivation and ARDS (RR 2.94; 95% CI 1.6-5.41). The association between intubation and HSV reactivation was probably due to disease severity although patients with a long intubation (> 7 days) had a RR of 2.77 (95% CI 1.79-4.30) for reactivation of HSV, even when controlled for SOFA max. Patients with HSV reactivation had a longer ICU as compared to those without the virus.Conclusion: HSV reactivation in ICU patients is more frequent than previously assumed. Reactivation of the virus in the throat is a major risk factor for the development of LRTI with the virus. Patients with HSV reactivation have a longer ICU stay as compared to controls. Further study on the effect of pre-emptive aciclovir therapy in these patients needs to be performed.P91 The clinical stages and prognostic factors of children with enterovirus type 71 infection developing pulmonary edema and hemorrhageJJ Chang*, SH Hsia*, LY Chang \u2020 , TY Lin \u2020 *Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, and \u2020 Division of Infectious Disease, Pediatric Department, Chang-Gung Children's Hospital, 5 Fu-Hsing St. Kweishan, Taoyuan, Taiwan 333, ROC Pulmonary edema/hemorrhage was the most severe complications of EV 71 associated hand-foot-mouth disease and usually led to cardiopulmonary failure. The mortality rate was 92% in the 1998 outbreak (11/12). During 2000 and 2001 outbreaks, the mortality rate had been reduced to 33% (8/24). This report was an observation of the clinical stages, risk factors and outcomes. There were 24 children brought to our PICU from May 2000 to June 2001. There were 10 females and 14 males. The age ranged from 5 to 93 months old (mean = 19.8). sented five clinical stages: (1) hand-foot-mouth disease; (2) meningoencephalitis; (3) cardiopulmonary failure; and (4) convalescence stage. The third stage was divided into two substages, (3A) hypertension stage and (3B) hypotension stage. The risk factors associated with mortality/morbidity were age, CSF leukocytosis, increased troponin I, episodes of cardiac arrest, decreased ejection fraction, need of high dosage inotropes support, lack of hypertension stage which might mean delayed hospital visit, initial very high serum glucose and very low worst PaO 2 -FiO 2 ratio. Fifty percent of survivors (8/16) had moderate to severe neurological sequelae and needed long-term respiratory care.

There is a controversy as to whether there is a particularly high risk of infection with multiple lumen CVCs. The aim of this systematic review of randomised trials was to test the evidence that multi-lumen CVCs, compared with single-lumen catheters, increase the risk of bloodstream infection, catheter colonisation, and insertion site infection.Materials and methods:Systematic search (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, bibliographies, to 12.2001, any language) for published full reports of randomised comparisons of multi-lumen versus single-lumen CVCs in adults, reporting data on the incidence of infection according to published criteria[2]. Two authors independently screened all retrieved reports and extracted data. Methodological validity of the reports was assessed by all authors using the Oxford scale. Data were combined using a fixed effect model and reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).Conclusions:There is evidence from randomised trials that on average one in 17 multi-lumen CVCs will lead to a bloodstream infection which would not have been the case had single-lumen CVCs been used. These data may have clinical implications.References: 1. Pittet, et al.: JAMA 1994, 271:1598-1601. 2.

NI concern 5-15% of hospitalised patients and can lead to complications in 25-50% of those admitted to the ICU[1].Methods:All patients with devices such as endotracheal tubes (ET), central venous lines (including pulmonary artery catheter) (CV) and/or urinary-tract catheters (UC) were prospectively enrolled during the first quarter of the years 1999 to 2001 according to a standardised protocol (KISS). Device-days, infections and infection rate were recorded. Data were analysed with regard to patients' severity of illness (SAPS II) and length of stay (LOS).Conclusion: Patients at risk to acquire a NI in our ICU are obviously sicker. Whether increased LOS is due to the underlying disease or a result of the NI remains unclear. Implementation of a prospective surveillance protocol of NIs (KISS) led to a significant reduction in device-days and ventilatory-days, but did not reduce the absolute number of NIs. Thus, device-reduction appeared to be most effective in the less severely ill patients only.Reference: 1. Bates DW, et al.: Arch Intern Med 1999, 159:2553. P98 Nosocomial infection: main cause in development of septic complications during postoperative period E Gyurov, M Milanov, S Milanov, P Neichev Emergency Institute 'Pirogov' -ICU, 21 Totleben, 1606 Sofia, Bulgaria Objective: To study the frequency of emergence of nosocomial infection in ICU.Design: Retrospective study of data from case records and flow sheets. One thousand four hundred and fifty-one postoperative patients admitted to ICU during 1999-2000.Measurements and main results:Of 1451 patients in our ICU during 2 years, we include those 613 (42.2%) who stayed for more than 72 hours. According to results from cultures we divided them to three groups. Group 1 included 355 (57.9%) patients without bacterial growth. Group 2 included patients with proved nosocomial infections (NCI). We obtained samples: 898 from 1%), and 17 from sputum (15 positive -88.2%). The most common place for development of NCI in our ICU is respiratory tract. On 5th ICU day the tract became infected in almost 56% of the patients. The major role among pathogens played Acinetobacter spp.(27.4%), Citrobacter spp. (20.3%), P. aeruginosa (12% and Serratia spp. (10%). The second place for NCI development is reserved for blood-stream infections. Almost the half of the cultures (47.2%) showed bacterial growth. The isolated pathogens were the same: Acinetobacter spp. (19%), Serratia spp. (16%), but there was substantial rise in emergence of S. epidermidis during the last year. Its frequency almost equalized that of Acinetobacter spp. The other two main sources for NCI were urine and CV catheters. They remained on 3rd and 4th places. Group 3 included patients with endogenous surgical infections. In this group we obtained samples from surgical wounds and drainages. In 1999 25.6% of cultures showed bacterial growth. During next 2000 this figure rose nearly twice (48.3%). The leading role played the same Acinetobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and E. coli. The role of S. epidermidis increased greatly during this period. Conclusions: There was a rise in frequency of nosocomial and secondary endogenous surgical infection in 1999-2000. The frequency of Gram-positive pathogens, namely S. epidermidis, nearly equalized that of Gram-negative flora as a cause of nosocomial infection.

Since both factors, inflammatory response and flow dynamics are severely altered during endotoxemia, we studied the effects of endotoxin on leukocyte-endothelial interactions under different levels of shear stress in vitro. In order to perform the experiments at precisely adjustable levels of shear stress, we used a parallel plate flow chamber as has been employed in a number of adhesion studies previously. Within this chamber, endothelial cells (HUVEC) could be perfused with neutrophils (PMN) at 0.25-3 dynes/cm 2 . FACS analysis of adhesion molecules, trypan blue exclusion and PMN migration showed that the cells were not altered during cell separation. To determine the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on shear-dependent adhesion, we studied HUVEC and PMN in a native state and following activation with LPS at 100 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml. All flow experiments were videotaped and the results were analysed by the paired t-test (P < 0.05). The effects of LPS on leukocyte-endothelial interactions strongly depended on the site of activation. Whereas LPS pretreatment of HUVEC increased PMN adhesion by 5-10 fold, pre-activation of the PMN resulted in a 50% reduction of adherent cells. In addition, after pre-activation of PMN, adhesion became increasingly dependent on shear stress and, thus, inhibition by LPS was most pronounced at a normal, postcapillary shear stress of 2-3 dynes/cm 2 . As demonstrated by addition of antibodies against selectins, the effect of LPS was due to a functional loss of L-Selectin and P-Selectin mediated interactions. In addition, inte-grin-mediated adhesion was impaired despite upregulation of CD11b on activated PMN. In summary, our results show that leukocyte-endothelial interactions become increasingly dependent on shear stress as soon as PMN are activated. Once PMN have undergone LPS activation, leukocyte tethering to the endothelium becomes entirely dependent on endothelial E-Selectin. Furthermore, adhesion efficiency decreases despite upregulated expression of CD11b. Since LPS increased the rigidity of PMN, it seems that the increased stiffness attenuated PMN adhesion by hampering PMN flattening and, thereby, reducing the number of available bonds to the endothelium.P106 Incidence and risk factors of reactive histiocytic hyperplasia with hemophagocytosis in medical intensive care patients R Strauss*, D Neureiter \u2020 , M Wehler*, B Westenburger*, Th Kirchner \u2020 , EG Hahn*", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF62": {"text": "Suster, et al.: Hum Pathol 1988, 19:705-712.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF64": {"text": "AdultElderly", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF65": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF66": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF67": {"text": "P113 Lipopolysaccharide binding protein: a poor parameter for the differentiation of SIRS and sepsis but useful as determinant of outcome in septic patients", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF68": {"text": "severe sepsis or septic shock", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF70": {"text": "Conclusion: AT prevents NF\u03baB-and MAPK-activation in EC and MO when given in therapeutical doses.

This investigation was performed to evaluate the agreement of invasive measurements at various sites, and to compare invasive and non-invasive methods of ABP monitoring under conditions of a heat-induced extreme vasodilation.Methods:In 19 patients, 48 treatments with WBH were performed. Measurements of ABP in radial and femoral artery, by oscillometry and sphygmomanometry, were taken at four temperature-levels during WBH (at 37\u00b0C, 40\u00b0C, 41.8\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C). Critical Care Vol 6 Suppl 1 22nd International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Results: For systolic ABP significant differences were seen between invasive and non-invasive methods with higher values for non-invasive measurements. For diastolic blood pressures sphygmomanometry gave higher and oscillimetry lower values when compared to both invasive measurements. Sphygmomanometry also showed higher values for mean ABP compared to all other techniques, while measurements in radial and femoral artery and by oscillometry differed only by about 5 mmHg.Conclusion:The hemodynamic management during WBH should be guided by mean arterial pressure instead of the systolic and/or diastolic pressure.

This study was performed to evaluate several parameters of systemic and intrathoracic hemodynamics during such a condition of hypercirculation with high cardiac output and low vascular resistance.Methods:A combination of reflexion photometry and thermodilution (COLD Z-021-System, Pulsion, Germany) was used to obtain mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), global enddiastolic volume index (GEDVI), intrathoracic blood volume index (ITBVI), total blood volume index (TBVI), right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI), right heart end-diastolic volume index (RHEDVI), left heart end-diastolic volume index (LHEDVI), pulmonary blood volume index (PBVI) and extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) at 37\u00b0C, 41.8\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C in 26 patients with metatased cancers during 51 WBH treatments. WBH was induced by infrared radiation (Iratherm 2000). Hemodynamics at 41.8\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C were compared with the initial values using Wilcoxon rank sum test for linked random samples.Results:Compared with the initial values at 37\u00b0C significant increases of CO, GEDVI, ITBVI, TBVI, RVEDVI, RHEDVI and PBVI and a significant decrease of MAP could be found at 41.8\u00b0C. For LHEDVI and EVLWI no significant changes were observed. Some of these parameters were still significantly changed during the cooling-down phase at 39\u00b0C, but, with exception of EVLWI, all parameters showed a clear tendency to pre-treatment levels. Only EVLWI showed a slight tendency to further increase during the cooling-down phase.Conclusions: Induced hyperthermia results in significant changes of cardiac output, intracardial and intrapulmonary volumes. Therefore monitoring of these parameters seems to be useful in risk patients and in other conditions of hypercirculation.P203 Is the degree of multiple organ dysfunction related to severity of capillary leakage? H Knotzer, W Pajk, A Mayr, M D\u00fcnser, W Hasibeder Division of General and Surgical Intensive Care Medicine, Department of Anaesthesia and Critical Care Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Anichstra\u00dfe 35, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria Introduction: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is believed to result from microcirculatory failure in surgical intensive care patients. We hypothesised that degree of MODS is mirrored by severity of capillary leakage assessed by venous congestion plethysmography.Methods: Twenty-two patients with MODS[1]  (moderate MODS group: less and equal 8 points, n = 13; severe MODS group: greater and equal 9 points, n = 9) were studied. All patients were monitored including a pulmonary artery catheter and a gastric tonometer during the study. Fluid filtration capacity and isovolumetric venous pressure were assessed using a electromechanical sensor with automated calibration for strain-gauge plethysmography (Filtrass 2001, Domed GmbH, Germany). In addition, arterial lactate concentrations, arterial-, mixed venous blood gas analysis and systemic hemodynamics were measured and systemic oxygen transport variables calculated. For statistical analysis paired Student's t-test and in cases of non-normal distribution the Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was performed. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Data are given as means \u00b1 SD.Results: There were no differences in age, systemic oxygen delivery, consumption and oxygen extraction ratio between groups.Mortality in patients with moderate MODS was 15.4%, in patients with severe MODS 55.6% (P = 0.049). Patients with high MODS demonstrated significantly higher arterial lactate concentrations (4.5 \u00b1 3 mmol/l) when compared with moderate MODS (1.7 \u00b1 0.9 mmol/l; P = 0.04). There was a trend towards higher capillary filtration coefficients in patients with severe MODS (5.33 \u00b1 2.04 ml/min/100 ml/mmHg \u00d7 10 -3 ) when compared to moderate MODS (4.02 \u00b1 1.48 ml/min/100 ml/mmHg \u00d7 10 -3 ; P = 0.062).Conclusion:Patients with severe MODS have a tendency towards higher capillary filtration coefficients suggesting increased capillary leakage. Neither systemic oxygen transport parameters nor tonometrically derived variables demonstrated any differences between MODS-groups despite significant differences in patients mortality.Hb, blood hemoglobin; [Hbt], tissue hemoglobin.P205 Utility of mixed venous vs central venous oximetry following cardiac surgery in infants SM Tibby, K Sykes, A Durward, C Austin, IA MurdochGuy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, UK Objective: Mixed venous oxygen saturation (PAsat) has been used as a surrogate marker for trends in cardiac output and oxygen utilisation:supply ratio following cardiac surgery in infants.

They were divided into two groups: the first group of consecutive 24 patients managed with oesophageal doppler and the second consecutive group of 25 patients managed according to usual intraoperative monitoring. In the first group of patients (doppler group [D]; n = 24, male: 67%, female: 33%; average age: 61.4 \u00b1 13 years; 79% -abdominal surgery for tumour) intraoperative hemodynamic management was based on the continual CO monitoring using oesophageal doppler (HEMOSONIC\u2122 100, Arrow International, Inc.). Doppler probe was inserted on an average 15 min after induction of general anesthesia. Whenever during surgery there was a drop in cardiac output below 5 l/min, usual diagnostic and therapeutic intervention were carried out to reach its normal range 5-7 l/min. Cardiac output values, for data processing, obtained from oesophageal dopplerometry, were collected in 30 min interval(Fig. 1). Intraoperative hemodynamic management in the second group of patients (non-doppler group [ND]; n = 25, male: 84%, female: 16%; average age: 61.8 \u00b1 9 years; 84% -abdominal surgery for tumour) was based on the monitoring of commonly used parameters: ECG, non-invasive blood pressure or invasive pressures (arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure), ETCO 2 , SpO 2 . Operating theatre staff, both anesthesiologic and surgical personnel, were blinded to patients' study inclusion. The postoperative management of both patient's groups was carried out in the Department of Surgery. Likewise the operating theatre staff, staff of the surgical department was also blinded to patients' study inclusion. In both D and ND group of patients we analysed and compared these data: ASA score, duration of surgery, blood units administered and fluid management intraoperatively, hemodynamic or respiratory instability occurrence during surgery, need for postoperative artificial ventilation longer than 24 hours, length of ICU stay, occurrence of postoperative complications (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, coagulation, CNS and wound complication) total length of hospital stay and mortality.

If oxygen delivery does not match VO 2 , tissue hypoxia ensues followed by organ failure. It is well known that critically ill patients have increased VO 2 , however what has not been fully explored is whether different disease categories have varying degrees of VO 2. The purpose of this study was to determine if VO 2 differs between subgroups of critically ill children.Methods: Ninety patients between the ages of 5 weeks and 16 years who were mechanically ventilated were included in this study. Patients were excluded if: air leak around the endotracheal tube was > 5%, FiO 2 was > 0.6, or catecholamine infusion was required. VO 2 was measured within the first 24 hours of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. A Deltatrac metabolic monitor, which uses a paramagnetic oxygen analyzer, was used to measure VO 2 . Measurements were obtained over 20 min and standardized to body surface area. Patients were categorized into medical, surgical, trauma, sepsis or cardiac surgery subgroups. Mean VO 2 in the medical subgroup was compared to the other subgroups.Data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni Multiple Comparisons test.Results:There was a statistically significant difference in the mean VO 2 between patients in the medical subgroup and patients in sepsis subgroup (P < 0.001), surgery subgroup (P < 0.01), and cardiac surgery subgroup (P < 0.001).

Introduction: The mortality of patients with acute renal failure (ARF) remains high (50-60%). Predictive variables of outcome include, age, altered previous health status, severity of illness, multiorgan failure, oliguria, cause of ARF [1] . We retrospectively analyzed all patients without pre-existing renal insufficiency, admitted to the surgical ICU between 1993 and 2000, who developed ARF, that was treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT).Methods: Three hundred and six (2.9%) of a total of 13,191 admitted patients were included in the study. Age, sex, APACHE II score, renal function parameters, initial diagnosis (hemorrhargic shock, trauma, post-liver transplantation, post-cardiac surgery, sepsis/MODS, other) were recorded as independent variables. Renal replacement therapy (intermittent, continuous, both), days in the ICU, emergency admission, and treatment with vasoactive drugs were recorded as dependent variables. Primary outcome variables were death in the ICU, poor renal recovery (poor outcome) or favorable renal recovery. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple logistic regression.Results: A total of 51% of patients with ARF died after the initiation of RRT (mortality of patients without ARF 7%). Patients with sepsis/MODS who developed ARF had a significantly higher mortality (68%) compared to all ARF patients (OR 0.18 [0.06-0.49]). A significantly better outcome, was noted for patients after liver transplantation (mortality 28%; OR 6.50 [1.50-33 .58]). Besides the initial diagnosis, APACHE II score and length of ICU stay were significantly correlated with mortality of these patients.

Objectives: To analyze data of preoperative, peroperative and postoperative period to identify factors that could be correlated to higher SICU-LOS among patients submitted to HS in our hospital. Conclusion: In our series using preoperative, peroperative and postoperative variables, we found three preoperative markers of longer SICU-LOS (Age, U-HS and E-HS), three FPD occurrence (PAC, IAB, LOS-MV) that could show the severity of hemodynamic disturbance, also two postoperative markers that were HS complications (AAF and need of re-operation). The strongest variables to predict higher SICU-LOS are found in the postoperative period in our hospital and are supported by highest OR.

Results: Almost 40% of all patients were septic within the first 24 hours of ICU admission, and 44% of these had severe sepsis (18% of all admissions). This proportion was consistent in both 1999 and 2000. The ICU mortality was 30% in the sepsis group and 50% in the severe sepsis group, compared to an overall Scottish ICU mortality of 21.5%. A further 9% die before hospital discharge. Although this attrition rate is similar to that in the general ICU population, it means that patients with severe sepsis are twice as likely to die before hospital discharge as the general ICU population. Patients with severe sepsis have higher APACHE II scores (mean 25) compared to those with sepsis (21) or the ICU population in general (19) and stay in ICU longer (mean increase 1.8 days, median 1.1).
