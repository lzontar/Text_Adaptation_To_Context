In fact, as a result, Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a major nutrition crisis, which has continued even up to the second decade of the twenty-first century. Some studies have shown that, compared to the rest of the world, Sub-Saharan Africa was the only place where cereal production and the quantity of cereals per person did not increase; instead, the latter declined between 1970 and 1991 in Mozambique by \u22123.1%, in Rwanda by \u22121.8%, and in Sudan by \u22122.8%. The devaluation of the currencies in Africa, especially the French franc in Africa in 1994, caused widespread dislocation. Lesley Doyal's study (1979: 102-103) concluded that, in Tanganyika, malnutrition was the result of colonialism, which devastated agricultural land production for 30 years, displaced major populations that had been highly productive and \"reduced the \"capacity of the land to feed the rest of the population.\" The IMF added insult to injury.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 990, "end": 1026, "text": "Lesley Doyal's study (1979: 102-103)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "It was under these economic and ideological manipulations of the West that the second generation of leaders inherited the reformed or revolutionized previous governance. The result has been the rampant corruption we witness today, with leaders who seem to be only half-heartedly committed to the health of the citizens, imposing an obvious mismatch of national priorities amidst flagrant elections rigging, open persecution, prosecution, and elimination of vocal opponents, and consistent constitutional manipulation to allow themselves to run indefinitely, while siphoning off, in the process, the already looted national treasury and the vast national resources. Worse even than that, the new leaders allocated only 5% of the national financial resources to education and 3% to health, while favoring, in employment and education, their cronies and families and, often, the ethnic group(s) to which they belonged, to the detriment of everyone else in the country. Meanwhile, while the poor continued to get poorer in the urban slums and villages, the nouveau-riches continued to get richer as parasites of the new capitalist state. International corporations and economic conglomerations, such as pharmaceuticals, succeeded in avoiding paying taxes and never transferring their technology and earned capital from the \"milk cow-nations\" they delighted to suck to achieve their profit goals. Much of the current infrastructure is inherited from the colonial period, namely: dilapidated schools; decaying health centers and hospitals; unclean and eroding trails and impassable roads; narrow and dangerous bridges; and unplanned city streets, resulting in polluting traffic jams that choke the city \"boulevards\" and highways.

Even more appalling, Malawi, with a population of close to 16 million, has only four government hospitals-one in Lilongwe, one in Blantyre, one in Zomba, and the other in Mzuzu.

(Mariani-Constantine et al. 2010: 244) Where do Africa's vast proceeds from oil, gas, and diamonds, gold, copper, timber, cocoa, tea, coffee, sisal, tobacco, and other national resources go? For example, Niger, made famous by the allegations from the Bush Administration that it was selling uranium to Saddam Hussein, has vast natural resources of uranium, gold, petroleum, and charcoal, but the country is unable to feed its small population of only 14 million. For those who follow the history of the continent and its leadership, the answer is self-evident: The resources are not primarily targeted to feed the people or end malnutrition and disease. Resources are apparently so mishandled that they make no major dent in the people's absolute poverty rate or contribute significantly to the elimination of ignorance through a robust educational system at all levels, and thus dramatically improving the state of health and health care. The 2001 Abuja Declaration signed by all African heads of state and government to increase the national health budgets to at least 15% of GDP has not been met by an overwhelming majority of the African states, and the written agreements on the three Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to health to be achieved by 2015 are, at best, lingering and dusting in many office drawers, while many health indices continue to fall to rates lower than those achieved by the first generation of post-independence African leaders.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 608, "end": 646, "text": "(Mariani-Constantine et al. 2010: 244)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The goal of primary health care focusing on prevention rather than treatment subscribed to at Alma-Ata in 1978 is often simply ignored, and African medical schools continue to be interested in training urban physicians and nurses that will serve the cities, marginalizing in the process the majority of the Africans who still live in the rural areas, while relying over 25-35% on international health budget hand-outs, such as those donated by USAID, PEPFAR, MEPI, and humanitarian organizations. It is important also to note that the allocation of resources is highly skewed in favor of city hospitals where the elite live and work, a fiscal habit that has been detrimental to all lower level health facilities-district, village, or community-everywhere in Africa. Often, religious and private facilities have saved the day outside the urban sphere but these often discriminate against people on the basis of their ideology or social and religious preference. The MDGs are a right step toward good health and eradication of poverty, but strong will and determination do not seem to be there, even though the resources are available, notwithstanding statements to the contrary. Consequently, by 2015, only a handful of states in Africa had achieved two or three of the pledged goals. Unfortunately, as studies by Curry et al. (2012) and by others note, theories of leadership in Africa so far have been \"based primarily on high-income settings and not on lowincome countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in the health arena.\" It is high time that serious studies be conducted of each African leader before overall assessments are made, looking at their training, experience, and intellectual ability, what some scholars have called \"biography,\" commitment to their people, use of national resources, probable persecution of opponents, manipulation of the constitution, their overt and covert activities abroad, and their vision of the future of the countries they lead or have led for decades, and how they select and prepare the younger generation to lead Africa.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1313, "end": 1332, "text": "Curry et al.

Indeed, \"integrated disease\" surveillance of such illnesses as cholera, meningitis, yellow fever, hepatitis E, plague, dysentery, malaria, Lassa fever, and leptospirosis, is conducted by only 39 of the 46 member states that agreed to do so. This is the reason the WHO advises taking at least \"verbal autopsies\" of deaths, particularly when it comes to relatives, as well as sentinel demographic surveillance, which involves \"monitoring a representative group for the vital events of interest\" (WHO, African Region Health Report 2013: 111).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 618, "end": 639, "text": "Report 2013: 55, 111)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "These varied shortcomings certainly account for the weak health systems on the continent, where virtually, as stressed above, no data are either accurate or sufficient. TB, which is increasing in parts of Africa, especially South Africa, can be stopped if the leadership decides to put the resources that epidemiologists and health practitioners have been requesting. For example, as the WHO has clearly recommended how to for combat TB, the use of the directly observed therapy (DOT) method is essential, as it is designed to assure adherence to medication particularly at the beginning of treatment. DOT should be performed by a trained health care worker or other designated individual for the prescribed TB drugs and watching \"\u2026the patient swallow every dose.\" Yet, as the WHO notes, \"the [DOT] strategy depends on government commitment, high-quality microscope for diagnosis, reliable supply of high-quality short-course anti-tuberculosis drugs administered under appropriate conditions, including direct observation of drug taking at least for the initial intensive phase of treatment as well as a system to monitor and evaluate case-finding and treatment outcomes\" (WHO, African Region Health Report 2013: 49). Many of these requirements are not observed or available in several African countries. Crucially, the true promoters of health in Africa are those leaders and individuals of good will who see preventable poverty as a major obstacle to health in any state and call for \"measures to tackle inequality and injustice such as corporate tax evasion [as] central to what is needed from the global community\" (Disease and Economics 2007).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1561, "end": 1565, "text": "[as]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Incidentally, poverty can, indeed, be eradicated from the planet but this requires leadership commitment, community awareness, human sensitivity on the part of policy-makers, actual action by both governmental, nongovernmental, faith-based, and philanthropic organizations, allocation of appropriate and sufficient resources, basic education and training in health-related issues, that might prevent healthy conditions, such as family planning, and, above all, equal opportunity regardless of race, ethnicity, country or geographic origin. It irks to hear certain politicians claim that poverty is a result of laziness, drug use and excessive alcohol consumption habits, and other associated behavioral factors. The fact of the matter is, however, that not only are many poor people trapped in conditions beyond their control but most would like to have gainful employment to support their families, and, like everyone else, live a decent life, rather than depend on government hand-outs that carry with them embarrassing and humiliating stigma. Some studies have shown, for example, that \"stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS are the greatest barriers to preventing further infection\" and that stigmatization of AIDS sufferers causes psychological problems for the patients, such as depression and loss of hope, and encourages silence and denial. It undermines prevention as those infected quietly continue to practice unsafe sex in the belief that behaving differently would raise suspicion about their status (UNAIDS World AIDS Campaign 2002 /2003 , cited by Ebewo 2008 .

Individuals imbued with this type of thinking do not realize that slum activities, like selling used shoes eight hours a day every day just to make $2.00, are actually designed to help them leave a life of abject poverty and the often unbearable conditions they live in, particularly when they see right across the street their fellow citizens leading a life of opulence and glamour, regardless of the means they used to occupy the envious position they hold in society. Politicians often forget that no human being can be resigned to the fate of a miserable life on this earth unless he or she does not see a way out or is mentally impaired. It is only when hopelessness and despair sink in that the poor might be inclined to take actions that society does not approve.

Invariably, it is mired in secrecy, especially at the high levels of authority, where great amounts of funds are channeled to a person, a president, a government minister, or a group of individuals who swear secrecy. What is frequently easy to detect and record are the hundreds of daily petty corruptive practices one encounters on the road on the part of the police, a government office where lower and higher level officials are required to dispense an original official document, such as a visa, to citizens, quick and effective treatment of a patient unfairly ahead of others at a hospital, hiring at a government establishment, or payment of funds to get a favor, often dubbed bribery, even though the latter may not involve money but sex, false testimony, and other subtle demands. Political corruption usually refers to paying people secretly to vote for a certain party or candidate, \"rigging,\" or stealing an election through unfair and non-transparent practices that may alter the results of a political process.

In Africa, corruption is a daily practice and sometimes involves millions of dollars. There have been instances, for example, where some portion of the public budget, a percentage of international donations, or investment funds have gone to government officials or researchers-say 10% of $300 million-to facilitate approval by the local authorities. Very rarely, though, have such thieves been denounced and imprisoned. Transparency International defines corruption \"as the abuse of public resources for private gain.\" Studies have been conducted on corruption, especially in the developing world, and the opinion of the experts is not too disparate in their view of it as a detrimental practice to everyone involved. Mavuto Kalulu has provided a summary of the major findings of the studies conducted on the subject, which we briefly note here. Mauro's 1995 study, for example, found that corruption slows and stifles economic growth by lowering national or private investment. In his research, Mauro showed that \"corruption has a negative and significant relationship with human capital, measured by the average schooling years in the population over age 25\" (Kalulu 2015) . While Tanzi and Davoodi (2001) claimed that corruption is detrimental to the quality of public investments, Gupta et al. (2001) , in one of the few studies focusing on its impact on the quality of health care services, conclude that \"child mortality rates in highly corrupt countries are about one-third higher than in the less corrupt countries\" (Kalulu 2014 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1259, "end": 1272, "text": "(Kalulu 2015)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1281, "end": 1305, "text": "Tanzi and Davoodi (2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1402, "text": "Gupta et al.

Another scholar, F.T. Liu (1985) defended the proposition that corruptive practices often reduce the time one spends on queues. Finally, some view corruption as beneficial by stressing the key economic assumption that self-interest enhances prosperity because competition ensures that \"a product is purchased by those who value it the most; thus firms that are willing to pay more in bribes are awarded contracts.\" This sounds like a twisted way of looking at unethical \"transactions\" (Kalulu 2014: 511) , because one wrong, immoral, or unethical behavior cannot justify the ends, even if its results might benefit certain people, just like when the benevolent \"bank bandit,\" who distributes all the money robbed from the banks to the poor.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 484, "end": 494, "text": "Liu (1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 947, "end": 965, "text": "(Kalulu 2014: 511)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Leadership Corruption in the heaLth"}, {"text": "Still, we agree that he needs to be incarcerated or proportionately punished.

Frequently, the doctor receives the patient at his informal health center, which is usually his house, or someone else's residence, and might force him or her to pay the sum to the proprietor, because the latter does not have a license to open the \"center.\" In other words, almost anywhere in Africa, the doctor is expected to be at the public facility during business hours, but he often practices on weekends and evenings at his own private clinic, perhaps located in his home, \"attending on a fee-for-service basis to make more money from his services\" (Spielberg and Adams 2011: 14).

As proof of corruptive practices, at the public hospital, the extra compensation he forces the patients to pay is not recorded by the official treasurer.

(Bayemi 2008: 42) In other words, the doctors play all kinds of schemes of thievery and corruption to make money out of vulnerable people, who have no way but to pay or leave, or go to the doctor's private or informal center, which often works in collusion with the pharmacies. The public hospital becomes, in a true sense, the recruiting ground for the doctor's private practice. Can one find more despicable unethical behavior than the one witnessed at some of the hospitals in Africa? One other consequence of the corrupt practices is people's distrust of the public hospitals. It is also common in Cameroon hospitals that the doctor will hire hustlers or brokers who stay around the entrance to the hospital throughout the day and ask the patient which doctor they would like to see. With a fee paid to the broker, which is split with the physician, the patient is able to see the doctor quickly, bypassing other patients who might have been waiting for hours. People know this but no one has the courage to denounce the physician involved for fear of retaliation. Those who refuse to pay may be waiting indefinitely.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 563, "end": 580, "text": "(Bayemi 2008: 42)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Leadership Corruption in the heaLth"}, {"text": "Finally, we might say that, once trust in the leadership is lost, nothing significant can be accomplished. Commenting on the leadership crisis in Africa and using the recent Ebola virus outbreak in West-Central Africa, Remy Adenoma wrote in The Guardian in September 2014 that \"trust is in short supply in Africa\" today, the reason why people refused to believe what the leaders, including their own presidents, were telling them about the epidemic, which they considered to be a hoax. In Nigeria, for example, despite promises of an infusion of millions of dollars to treat the sick and pay the daily wages of the health care givers, nurses, and doctors, people took the leaders' words as a bunch of lies, as Adenoma points out, given that \"The government is still owing medical personnel overdue allowances it seems unwilling to pay, so people fear risking their lives with no back up\" (Adenoma 2014: 2). The mistrust and cynicism, he says, is not caused by the actions of the politicians alone but of virtually all strangers, citizens or not, who are said to rob and steal the property of some and kidnap others. Policemen do not seem to care about enforcing the laws and are constantly seeking bribes to perform their duties, while many government officials embezzle state funds at all cost for themselves and their families.

Road and highways can be built in the space of a few years and Ebola outbreak will most likely be curbed within a few months, but the deep mistrust and cynicism pervasive in many African societies will continue to impede progress on the continent for decades to come. (Adenoma 2014: 3) Adenoma is quick to point out, however, that corruption is not unique to Africa; it occurs in the Western world and other parts of the globe as well but not in the magnitude or the obvious and widely known level of corrupt behavior as on the African continent. People in other parts of the world know that, when there is a serious crisis, they can count on their government to protect them: Not in Africa, says Adenoma. Adenoma certainly has a point but cynicism and distrust, to this author, are not only based on corruption and lack of follow-up on the promises, conditions that have created a leadership crisis, especially in health in Africa. More important is the apparent lack of commitment to the welfare of the people, especially in health; the lack of clear priorities that place citizens at center-stage; the lack of vision of the future and a sense of entitlement among our leaders; the lack of investment of resources; the prevailing sense of utter powerlessness among the African people; and the blatant misuse of the national treasury-as is the case in Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria, Chad, and Liberia. Resources are siphoned daily on behalf of the leaders, their families, relatives, friends, fellow kin, and their crony supporters who may not even realize what is going on. Unfortunately, when they assume political responsibility, leaders seem not to realize that their position is a sacred trust and a privilege and not an entitlement or a birth right. In his short but brilliant chapter \"On the Poverty of Health Politics in Africa: Are Governments Doing Enough?\" Binna Innocent Hunan, writing from his own living experience on the continent, first refutes David Bailey's insinuation that corruption in developing countries is \"not necessarily antipathetic to the development of modern economic and social systems; that corruption serves in part at least a beneficial function in developing societies\" (1966: 719). He then mercilessly concludes by laying bare the unclothed \"emperors\" of Africa, calling their governance pathologic, one that breeds only pain for the African people. Then he goes on to note that his chapter \u2026situates the question of African ill-health in social terms and insists that this has arisen as a result of leadership proclivities to pursue parochial interests disguised as the collective good. Consequently, policies have had to be tailored to suit leadership interests rather than focus on easing the pains of the downtrodden masses. It pontificates that orchestrated wars and official thievery can only contribute to the problems of African people mired in structural dependence. The need for positive in Africa is strong: leadership which is not only seen, but expresses genuine concerns in acting to remove Africa and its people from these crippling problems of war and conflict, power economics, de-industrialization, squalor, and disease. The new dawn may well begin to save Africans of such odd epithets as \"predatory, prebendal, parasitic\u2026kleptocratic, venal [or] vampire state. (Ihuna 2008: 312) Ihuna views Africa's leadership as laced with corruption and mismanagement, straddling economies in collapse and indebted, mired in wars that have decimated populations, where \"poverty is entrenched through increasing denial of opportunities, as happens in the realm of educational attainment. With a high profile of unemployed among the employable youth suffering from economic crisis, Africa cannot be saved from either rural or urban anarchy,\" as these \"become ready tools for mischief and mayhem.\" Claire Wendland notes the same problems in Malawi medical schools, even though they are not related directly to private practice, which anger the medical students who focus their conversations on the waste of funds resulting from corrupt practices, continuing to create a wave of unrest due to official corruption. These crooked financial practices, Wendland noticed, \"not only diverted resources away from the health sector but also could divert resources within the health sector toward certain favored constituencies or patients.\" There were cases including where an MP hoarded medications and had his relatives sell \"the hospital's scarce resources in the public market, and even though complaints were formally leveled against him but the involved doctor [who was posted in the rural area as a district officer], was not punished\" (Wendland 2010: 141-141) . Another expert notes that the hospitals and health facilities often do not have the workforce needed or the latter may be reserved just for the elite, as Niang notes, where public control of the public structures does not exist, that is, there is no accountability to the people; resources reserved for the hospitals are constantly reduced (or reserved for the powerful and the wealthy); and investment in hygiene is never considered to be a priority (Niang 2008: 29) . One should then rightly ask: \"Quo vadis, Africa?\" Cameroon is just an example, but corrupt practices in the health sector are widespread in Africa and successful because they focus mainly on the sick, the illiterate, the poor, the disadvantaged, the disabled, and ethnic minorities, who are the most vulnerable citizens in the country.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 498, "end": 515, "text": "(Adenoma 2014: 3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3561, "end": 3578, "text": "(Ihuna 2008: 312)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4917, "end": 4941, "text": "(Wendland 2010: 141-141)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5395, "end": 5411, "text": "(Niang 2008: 29)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Leadership Corruption in the heaLth"}, {"text": "We cannot end a discussion of global health without mentioning one of the fastest growing health care businesses in the world, medical tourism, which gained added significance during the mid-2000s.

It means traveling across continents to get the best medical treatment possible, as perceived by the patients, at the most affordable price. The aging baby boomers and, therefore, the growing number of the elderly who are more prone to ill health, have been forced to travel to such places as India, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, and even to Eastern European countries. The movement has also included people from the industrialized countries who are so proud, at least in public, of their own health care systems. They, too, are looking for treatment bargains in the developing world. Unfortunately in Africa, only South Africa, with its tourist packages, has been able to attract this wave of medical tourists. In sum, medical tourists are not necessarily seeking the lowest cost but quality treatment of their ills along with short waiting periods, to satisfy those needs that are hard to meet at home, unavailable procedures, new and old health products, as well as privacy, opportunities for vacation, and relaxing spots away from home.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 413, "end": 435, "text": "(Thomas Friedman 2005)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "mediCaL tourism"}, {"text": "In 2007, for example, some 270,000 Americans sought medical treatment abroad.

However, despite the increase in the search for treatment abroad, the medical tourist movement raises several questions since it is an intrinsic part of globalization. The questions most relevant refer to its impact on the poor in the receiving countries and on the fact that, in the end, medical tourism favors the rich from the originating countries who are able to fly or drive and pay for the treatment sought.

Frustrated, they too may appear to throw in the towel. Ample disturbing anecdotal evidence claims that most physicians get irritated when a potential patient, especially a woman suffering from breast pain or suspected female-related cancer, hints at the need for a second opinion. One often hears also that, when a patient complains of fever, for example, physicians are quick to dispense or prescribe malaria drugs or antibiotics; that when someone seeks treatment and comes in coughing, physicians or nurses tell him or her that he or she suffers from HIV/AIDS or TB and therefore prescribe anything that will make him feel good; and that, if a woman is admitted complaining of severe headaches, some doctors may ask her to undress completely!

This push for an environment that does not constitute a direct or indirect cause of certain diseases, such as respiratory ailments and cancers, has been accepted by Africans, at least in theory. In fact, when one travels across the continent and sees the prevailing polluted conditions in the cities, the roads, and the villages, one easily gets the impression that the leaders are sleeping behind the wheel. While smoke plagues the cities of Africa from East to West and North to South, there seem to be no regulations on harmful gas emissions from vehicles, trucks, in particular, and motorcycles, and water and soil contaminated by chemical and industrial waste, some of which can be seen oozing above the ground and in the waters people rely on for survival. While Kenyans have seen, on their own, the need to wear smoke hoods in the city of Nairobi to protect their health from polluters, the state simply looks on at the environmental degradation. Lead is generously used in gasoline and other materials, as if scientific warnings about the hazards this metal poses to children in particular mean nothing. Environmentalists point out that, in Africa, towns and houses are often built at former waste disposal sites. Africa's unclean environment is worsened by indoor pollution in windowless village houses, as is the case with Maasai dwellings, for example, which carry particulate levels 100 times higher than those accepted by the international community, coupled with poor ventilation and low lying smoke that can cause respiratory diseases and eye irritation, especially among children. Furthermore, food safety, especially for items cooked along the dusty streets and in the stands of city markets almost all over Sub-Saharan Africa, should constitute a major concern for the authorities. Yet, only a few countries are making an effort to inspect the markets at some point in the food chain. The dangers of contamination and toxicity are real under such circumstances. For example, insufficiently prepared cassava (or manioc) is known to cause paralysis. Yet, cassava is a major food staple in parts of Africa that is not inspected. In Kenya, ingestion of contaminated corn (maize) killed 125 out of 317 reported cases in 2004. It was apparently caused by an infectious disease locally called konzo. Finally, we might note that 72% of the people in Sub-Saharan Africa do not have waste disposal facilities (WHO, African Region Health Report 2013), which is a serious health hazard. Luckily, Botswana, Ghana, and Tanzania are in the forefront among nations in Africa that plan to adopt a policy of hazard analysis of critical food control points (HACP), an internationally accepted system of food safety management. Food safety measures that apply to items sold in the streets and open markets and others being slowly introduced in Botswana, Ghana, Tanzania, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Congo, and Guinea-Bissau are an encouraging sign designed to protect the public. As the WHO notes, \"Hygiene arrangements among vendors of cheap ready-to-eat food are often very poor in most developing countries. Adequate running water, toilets and washing facilities are rare, many vendors fail to disinfect surfaces or wash their hands, food is not usually protected from insects, and refrigeration is seldom available,\" all of which facilitate the transmission of Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., hepatitis A virus, and Escherichia coli (African Region Health Report 2013: 90). 1 A major weakness that must be overcome by African states and institutions, including all medical schools on the continent, is the realization that, without research undertaken by the African themselves who know their milieu more than anyone else in the world, innovation, development and implementation of new technologies is as important as other components of health and the wellbeing of the people (ECOSOC 2009: 23). Indeed, without data, hypotheses, and experimentation there will be no better health in the longterm, and the continent will be forever dependent on Western researchers, even if they collaborate with them, as they will remain appendages in the process and embrace already-formulated theories and practices that fit the foreign researchers' culture and needs. African leaders are quick to point to lack of resources for social programs about which their leadership is challenged by citizens at home and abroad. We reproduce below the figures on oil and gas production in 19 African countries provided by the US Department of Energy, and EY estimates for 2010. The figures refute the excuses presented, especially if they are considered along with other resources Africa has to offer. Six or seven countries are the largest owners and producers of oil in Africa-Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Algeria, Angola (oil), Sudan (oil), and Egypt (gas), but the prospects for a bright economic future that end or reduce poverty by half in such countries as Ghana, Tanzania, Mozambique, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Mali, and Kenya, where oil fields have been found or are suspected to exist, are not promising. The question is: How are these resources being used or will be used in the years to come for the benefit of all people, while ending, simultaneously, poverty as we know it? (Table 3.

Writing in The Guardian in 2013, Ben Shepard called the oil and gas boom in Africa the \"resource curse,\" as is the case for Uganda that has been trying to decide how it will manage the reserves just discovered in the country. Shepard writes that: \"Sound legislation and Ugandan specific frameworks are futile unless corruption is curtailed and there is a transparent public involvement,\" inclusive of civil society, in the management of future resource revenues. Otherwise, waste, corruption, and environmental catastrophe, may ruin the chances of a bright future that could benefit the health of Uganda's people. Currently, 22 countries in Africa are known to have oil reserves, including Uganda, Kenya, and Mozambique. Yet, as the Daily Graph shows, \"oil has been a headache for most African countries and poor governance, consistent corruption, oil revenue going into private accounts outside their respective countries, coupled with major environmental damage and rampant poverty have all caused fractures in these countries\" (USEIA 2013). In the case of Equatorial Guinea, which pumps 322,000 barrels a day, oil production accounts for 90% of its revenue and 98% of exports resulting in GDP per capita of $19,000. These conditions are only comparable to the oil potential boom in South Sudan but complicated by political unrest. Yet, more than 60% of Equatoguineans, as is the case in Angola, live on $1.00 a day. The oil in Angola has resulted in a double-digit growth of the GDP, as the oil companies are pumping 1.9 million barrels a day. But, here, too, the benefits do not reach most of the populace, in a continent that is expected to experience a strong economic growth over the next few years. In fact, the World Bank has predicted that \"Africa will grow at its pre-crisis rate of 5% over the period 2013-2015 (4.9% in 2013, gradually strengthening to 5.2% in 2015) .\" Naturally, the [2009] [2010] fall in oil prices that started in 2015 will negatively impact the rosy predictions. The generated funds could jumpstart Africa and enable it to feed its people, take care of their health and educational needs, and engage in a massive infrastructure build up. The chances of this to happen, however, are slim, if the disappointing past experience under the second generation of African leadership is an indication. The WHO has listed the following obstacles to health and health care embedded in the health systems on the African continent: high maternal, infant, and child death rates, as already pointed out throughout this volume; increased injuries stemming from violent behavior, such as war, and vehicular crashes, particular in urban areas; poor and insufficient infrastructure; lack of consistent water and electricity supply; inadequate educational opportunities, which makes it difficult to access health care; long distances to health care facilities; high cost of medicine; lack of repairs for the upkeep of facilities; chronic absenteeism by an inadequately competent and committed workforce, including administrators, physicians, nurses, and midwives; low morale among the lower staff; scarcity of essential medicines; and poor practices in the acquisition and distribution of basic health supplies.

It is no wonder that the WHO stresses the point that studies have shown that 53% of children's deaths in Africa occur due to underweight, malaria, pneumonia, and measles, while 25% are the result of malnutrition and diarrhea. Among the under-five deaths, studies indicate that about 53% can be attributed to underweight and 36% to the effect of undernutrition for diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and measles.

(WHO, African Regional Health Report 2013: XIX) In almost every one of these health system requisites, Sub-Saharan Africa's health systems are either dysfunctional or simply weak.

This makes it difficult to present an argument defending or condemning it completely, that is, one that is acceptable to all. Ironically, colonial administrators and concessionaire companies tended to consider Africans to be intrinsically uncontrollable intoxicated people, while they themselves spent their evenings indulging in hard whisky, cognac, wine, or beer and losing control over their own actions and words.

However, colonialists' stories of chronic drinking among Africans were usually exaggerated. The missionaries looked at drinking as an evil tendency inherent in Africans, which \"the Natives\" could not resist. Theirs were moral judgments based on religion, which Africans had no obligation to follow, given that the holy missionaries themselves were not models either in alcohol consumption, which they claimed they did \"in moderation, when necessary.\" Echoing the hypocritical stand of the colonialists and many of their missionaries in Africa, Frederick Lugard, twice governor of Nigeria, considered using proceeds from liquor as \"a scandal in the eyes of civilization when the administration of a British Colony has become almost wholly dependent for revenue on the sale of intoxicating drink\" (Heap 2012: 143-144) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1129, "end": 1149, "text": "(Heap 2012: 143-144)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "aLCohoLism and drug use in afriCa"}, {"text": "Rarely did colonialists make the point that, like the Europeans, most of the drinking was done at home or at social gatherings for relaxation, almost never during the work hours, and that women and children were not expected to indulge in it. Most importantly, much of the drinking did not result in quarrels and violence as they claimed. If any, most of the violence was verbal rather than physical. Excessive drinking was always condemned. Invariably, also, the colonizers disregarded the fact that drinking was often a visible expression of the misery caused by the colonial system, conveniently forgetting that the production of alcohol was one of the few sources of cash that would allow them to pay taxes the colonial government had imposed on them. For others, such as the poor, it was the only way to enjoy some of the easy pleasures of life and forget, at least for a fleeting moment, their destitute condition. The same phenomenon was observed during the 1980s as a result of the global economic down turn. Bryceson reminds us that, \"Alcoholically joyful, creative exchanges have been described as 'poor man's opera' for those who do not have the financial means to procure more expensive aesthetic experiences or exhilarating pastimes\" (2002: 7). Some of the factors that enhanced the drinking of alcohol, say the experts, was and still is, in Africa, the attractive packaging and the slick advertisement of the bottles by the big corporations or mass beer brewers. Despite the abundance of colonial alcoholic beverages, Africans never stopped drinking their own traditional alcoholic creations while gladly embracing the imported new varieties, such as gin and rum. This was true both during the colonial period and in post-independence Africa. As one colonial administrator accurately put it, \"Yet to some colonial commentators there was too much consumer choice: The African has his palm wine and corn beer.

The popularity of strong alcoholic beverages was made the easier as Africans had become very adept in fermenting their own products at home. Thus, Sunday rest, funeral occasions, social gatherings, and the heavy advertising by companies have made whiskey, wine, even vodka, beer, gin, and other spirits popular with African males, particularly among those with enviable jobs, including many civil servants, presidents, and university professors.

Nonetheless, its psychoactive qualities lend it added value above and beyond its thirstquenching utility and the cost of the labor and raw materials to make it\" (2002: 4-5).

The African Program for Onchocerciasis initiated by the WHO and other international organizations in 1995 has \"treated 34 million people in 16 countries to date.\" But the majority of the people do not receive treatment for it. It is important to mention here that Upper Volta, now Burkina Faso, used to be one of the preferred habitats for the Simulium damnosum fly which causes river blindness. As far as we know, there was no coordination between Britain and France in their attempt to rid the two areas from the disease during the colonial period. Unfortunately, sleeping sickness and cerebrospinal meningitis were the most threatening diseases in the area.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "eradiCating the deadLiest diseases in afriCa"}, {"text": "In the case of trypanosmiasis, for example, the situation was exascerbated by lack of communication the situation was exacerbated by lack of communication among the colonial departments, and there was little knowledge among the British administrators and public health officials of what the French in Upper Volta were doing to contain or control sleeping sickness in their territory. In Nigeria, concern about the serious ravages of trypanosomiasis came much later than in Ghana, but, by that time, thousands of people had been either been disabled or killed by the disease. This was also true in Chad, Gambia, Nigeria, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Congo. Eventually, drugs, insecticides, and forest clearance reduced its devastating effect considerably. Sadly, in Africa, these are common deadly diseases that often cause severe pain and suffering and even death or leave their victims disabled for life. As a result, some epidemiologists call them the \"neglected tropical diseases\" (Mariani-Constantini 2011: 245) . These neglected infectious diseases on the continent tend to affect children and the poor most, hitting a billion others worldwide, and \"are mostly attributable to well known factors, notably, unsafe water, poor housing, and poor sanitation\" (see also Stein et al. 2007 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 989, "end": 1020, "text": "(Mariani-Constantini 2011: 245)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1292, "text": "Stein et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "eradiCating the deadLiest diseases in afriCa"}, {"text": "To recapitulate this chapter's comments on the subject of infectious diseases, the following brief paragraphs may help the reader remember their etiology and impact on Africa and its people. Malaria is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito, which breeds all year round in hot and humid climate, and is common to most swampy areas of the continent; leishmaniasis is transmitted by sand flies living in scrubland; whereas river blindness is transmitted by black flies that thrive in fast river currents. The tsetse fly carries parasites that cause sleeping sickness, while ordinary flies are causes of an eye disease called trachoma. River snails penetrate the human skin in snail infested water and are responsible for a debilitating disease called bilharziasis or schistosomiasis, and children and women are most vulnerable to it as they tend to be more often in contact with rivers, lakes, and streams. Schistosomiasis affects mostly children, as noted, and is not deadly, but adversely impacts \"the quality of life of adults, and infects 160 million people in Africa annually contributing to anemia among pregnant women\" (39). Since it affects mostly children, ages 5-14 years, studies have shown that \"heavy infestations may impair the cognitive function of these children\" (WHO, African Region Health Report 2013: 39). Rabies, which cannot be transmitted from human to human, comes from mad dogs, cats, and bats, and is deadly.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ConCLusion"}, {"text": "Yellow fever's vector is a mosquito called Aedis aegypti. Mosquitoes are also responsible for lymphatic filariasis, and hemorrhagic fever. In African urban areas, in particular, hepatitis, typhoid, and diarrhea, occur quite often. Cholera, bacillary dysentery, and worm diseases are caused by roundworms, hookworms, and tapeworms, or helminths, which are soil-transmitted to humans. Neglected infectious diseases contribute to severe pain, suffering, and lifelong disabilities and are responsible for enormous loss of individual and household productivity, businesses slowdown, and lowering a country's economic output, such as the GDP. Despite the ubiquitous nature of the parasitic worms, they have been reduced by 96% globally since 1986. However, most of the remaining cases occur in 13 African countries, in which the final phase of its eradication has proven difficult. Leprosy is another infectious disease that has almost been eradicated globally, except in Africa, where 96% of the cases were contained 20 years ago, but the remaining 4% have been extremely problematic and resilient. Currently, at least seven African countries are struggling with the incidence of leprosy, where the global goal was to reduce it to one case per 1000 people by 2003. Nigeria is one of the countries that, along with Botswana, Mali, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, Zambia, Niger, and Tanzania, seems to have achieved the goal but the stigma of leprosy is still strong here. In Mozambique, the prevalence rate for leprosy was 127,500 in 1991, but the number was reduced to 51,200 or 60% by 2003, with 800,000 cases been cured through use of effective drugs. Fortunately, physicians have reported that it is not drug-resistant in endemic environments such as CAR, Tanzania, Angola, Mozambique, and Madagascar, where it is endemic but it has almost been eradicated (WHO, African Region Health Report 2013: 42). Africa has had remarkable success in eradicating or controlling the spread of some infectious diseases following independence during the 1960s and 1970s. However, a much more daunting task is left unfinished. This includes an unexpected increase of blindness from diseases and associated risks expected in the near future, from the current nine million cases of blindness to 15 million by 2020, of which 80% are totally preventable or curable. Mental health is simply a disaster of epidemic proportions in Sub-Saharan Africa as alluded to in this chapter. The UN Population Program notes that, of the 800 million living in Sub-Saharan Africa during the first decade of the twenty-first century, 50% suffer from one form or another of handicap but only 2% receive specific rehabilitation care. Also, 90% of children with mental health disorders die before the age of five, and the majority of the affected are the poor people and the unemployed (Niang 2008: 11) . Unfortunately, researchers have not shown much interest in the problem of mental health on the continent. A study conducted by Turshen in 1989 showed that the number of references in the literature is sparse and that none of them referred to the disease in women, who tend to be the most affected.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2834, "end": 2850, "text": "(Niang 2008: 11)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ConCLusion"}, {"text": "Measles, virtually eradicated in many parts of the globe by now, still hits 11 million children in Africa annually, with consequences that contribute to deaths and a weakened immune system, a condition that is preventable through vaccine during the first years of life.

In Kenya, for example, despite the country's touted health care system in Sub-Saharan Africa, still faces 80,000 deaths per year from AIDS, and 1.5 million people still live with HIV, even though the incidence was reduced to 6% in 2009, from 8% in 2001. The number of orphans, who lost one parent or both, has reached 1.2 million. Malaria, on the other hand, affects eight million Kenyans every year, and the so-called Rift Valley fever and chikungunya, a disease similar to dengue, continue to cause thousands of unnecessary deaths, notwithstanding the various effective treatments now available. The conditions are not much better in other African countries. Despite the major effort made by the government and its enviable hospitals, South Africa has a population of at least 5.5 million who live with HIV/AIDS, at the rate of one per 10 people, resulting in some three million related deaths since the discovery of HIV during the mid-1980s (Smith 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1322, "end": 1334, "text": "(Smith 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ConCLusion"}, {"text": "It is important to note here as well that the fight against HIV/AIDS is not over, even though several experimental vaccines are being conducted through clinical trials, especially in East Africa.

Africans get defensive when the continent is blamed as being the original place of several diseases, a point that cannot be proven, as has happened with HIV/AIDS. The issue of the origins of HIV/AIDS is still being debated today, more than three decades after its discovery during the 1980s. A theory advanced and published in the Journal of Science in 2006 attributes the origins to Southeastern Cameroon, the result of a team study led by Professor Beatrice Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Dr. Paul Sharp from the University of Edinburgh. The project's aim was to search for the simian virus in chimpanzees feces collected \"across a vast swath of Southeastern Cameroon.\" The team traced the carrier to an African porter employed by the French sometime between 1890 and 1900 or thereabouts. The researchers claimed that one hungry man went hunting and killed a blood infected chimpanzee. The blood subsequently infected the hunter, \"probably through a cut during butchering.\" This tragedy occurred \"amid massive infusion of new people and technology into a land where ancient ways still prevailed,\" as the \"\u2026 European powers engaged in a feverish race for wealth and glory in blazed routes up muddy rivers and into dense forests that had been travelled only sporadically by humans before\" (Timberg and Halperin 2012: 1-3) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1394, "end": 1426, "text": "(Timberg and Halperin 2012: 1-3)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Suspected Origins of HIV and the Ebola Virus: Africa?"}, {"text": "It appears that the porters had cut a path right through the area where the chimps lived, enhancing the transmission of the virus to man. The team found in the chimps' feces the virus strain known as HIV-1 group M, which can be carried by simians, such as gorillas and monkeys. This was \"a lightly developed southern region where relatively few people live even today, scientists say.\" The study' conclusions seemed to confirm what many scientists had known or speculated before, namely, that a blood sample from 1959 indicated that Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC, had been the virus habitat many decades prior to its discovery during the 1980s. In 2008, Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist working in a laboratory at the University of Arizona, published his own findings in the journal Nature after discovering a second sample of the virus \"trapped in a wax-encased lymph node biopsy from 1960.\" He compared the genetic structure of the two samples and concluded that the HIV-1 group M was much older than thought at the time. He was convinced that he had proven that both samples had come from the same ancestor, sometime between 1884 and 1924. However, the most probable year seems to be 1908. The HIV-1 group M is said to have been hatched somewhere along the banks of Sangha River, which flows toward Central Africa, an area where Kinshasa is also located. Timberg and Halperin add that \"this section of the Sangha was not ideal for navigation because of its ribbons of sandbars and the dense vegetation along the banks\" (Timberg and Halperin 2012: 2) , the reason why the virus did not spread as fast. This international team had set up 10 stations spread over a wide portion of Southeastern Cameroon, and found the HIV-1 group M virus samples in two of the stations, which were completely remote from any population, and were almost a perfect match of the HIV-1 Group M, whose impact has been, since the 1980s, so devastating to mankind.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1535, "end": 1565, "text": "(Timberg and Halperin 2012: 2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Suspected Origins of HIV and the Ebola Virus: Africa?"}, {"text": "Adding to the theory about the alleged origins of HIV just discussed is the controversy over the transmission of the Ebola virus and its possible links with the great apes in parts of West Africa. As argued in this volume, the cohabitation of animals, including chimpanzees, and men goes back centuries, and it appears that West Africa was aware that the big apes could transmit the disease to men, even prior to the most recent outbreaks. During the 1990s, hunters in the region are also said to have been aware of the disease, and recognized the phenomenon from the new outbreak but were not convinced that Ebola had come from the chimps. In other areas, such as Gabon, people were not only aware of the disease but knew that chimps could also suffer from it just as man could. Thus, in their minds, the disease could come from either man or chimp. This a plausible reason why the epidemic broke out in Gabon in 1997, hunters had detailed knowledge of the index case-a hunter who had found a dead gorilla in the forest and had brought it back to his village to share with others\" (Giles-Vernick and Rupp 2013: 128-130) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1101, "end": 1120, "text": "Rupp 2013: 128-130)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Suspected Origins of HIV and the Ebola Virus: Africa?"}, {"text": "In Africa, the mentally ill interest the authorities only when they disturb the public order.

However, unlike the developing world, 85% of it is not treated here. Epilepsy goes virtually untreated in Africa, whereas, in the industrialized world, the treatment rate is 80%. Unfortunately, again, very little research has been done on these disorders in Africa. The African sub-continent has virtually no mental health programs worth mentioning and no facilities that would pass a rigorous test, even though Ghana is planning to introduce a robust program in the near future. Until now, Sudan and South Sudan, for example, have not had a single psychiatry training institution or psychiatrists at work. Families and NGOs are expected to fill the gap, something that is not happening because, in part, the stigma, the cost, the difficulty of proper diagnosis, and the impact of abject poverty seen in African cities and rural areas are a deterrent. Ignorance of the etiology of mental disorder and the means to provide effective control against it lead people to explain it as a result of social deviance and ancestors' curse. Mental illness accounts for 5% of the disease burden on the continent and 19% of all disability in Sub-Saharan Africa. Says WHO: \"The Region has fewer mental health professionals than any other WHO Region.

It takes sensitivity to ensure that all people are entitled to good nutrition and that, when instances of famine and hunger occur, human empathy must prevail and help trigger government action. A minor episode illustrates this point. When a major famine hit Beira, Mozambique, during the 1990s, one high level government official said in public in Portuguese something like: \"Nao ha fome aqui na Beira, porque todas as manhas eu vejo muita gente a cagar no mato do campo em frente deste palacio!\" (\"There is no famine here in Beira, because every morning I see many people defecating in the bush in front of this palace!\").

Restriction of hours at nights when buses can run, the use of helmets for motorcycles, laws on seat belt use, limitation in alcohol consumption for drivers, clear road signs, speed limits enforcement, and rumble strips have decreased the number of fatalities in many African cities and highways. Ghana is a good example where lives have being saved. Ghana's fatalities per 10,000 vehicles were about 30-40 times higher than those in countries with higher incomes.
