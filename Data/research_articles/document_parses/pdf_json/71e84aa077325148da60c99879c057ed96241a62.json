She required intubation and mechanical ventilation for airway protection, given her reduced level of consciousness. The patient's condition deteriorated, and MRI on day 6 demonstrated worsening brain stem swelling with symmetrical hemorrhagic lesions in the brain stem, amygdalae, putamina, and thalamic nuclei. Appearances were consistent with hemorrhagic ANE with early brain stem involvement. The patient showed no response to steroid therapy and died on the eighth day of admission.",

As of April 30, 2020, over 3 million cases have been reported worldwide and over 230,000 people have died from the infection. The typical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 with fever and respiratory symptoms is well recognized, although there is comparatively little reported on the neurologic sequelae. Despite the paucity of reported cases, there is increasing evidence that patients with severe COVID-19 often develop neurologic manifestations such as impaired consciousness. 1 There have been reported cases of COVID-19-associated encephalopathy and a single case of presumptive COVID-19-related acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy associated with symmetrical hemorrhagic, necrotic lesions in both the thalamic nuclei and amygdalae. 2 Here, we report a further case of possible COVID-19-related necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy associated with early brain stem involvement.",

Shortly after arrival in the emergency department, the patient vomited and had a further GTCS. She had a history of aplastic anemia treated with intermittent red blood cell and platelet transfusions. The patient had no significant paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clone. She had received immunosuppressive therapy in the past, but not recently. She had returned from a trip to Afghanistan 3 weeks before presentation and developed transient abdominal pain and diarrhea. Ten days before her neurologic presentation, she developed a persistent cough, sore throat, shivering, and headache, with subsequent shortness of breath and myalgia. Three days before presentation, she had a routine telephone hematology clinic consultation and the following day underwent a blood test (table, day-2) which showed a stable platelet count (33 \u00d7 10 9 /L), anemia (hemoglobin 103 g/L), and leukopenia (total white cell count 3.8 \u00d7 10 9 /L, lymphocyte count 1.4 \u00d7 10 9 /L, neutrophil count 1.8 \u00d7 10 9 /L).",

Neurologic assessment found no focal deficits. Chest radiography showed right basal consolidation, and a CT scan of the head showed early swelling of the brain stem (figure 1). On admission, her blood cell count showed unchanged anemia and thrombocytopenia (platelet count 29 \u00d7 10 9 /L) which was consistent with the patient's history of aplastic anemia (table). Unlike previous blood counts, there was new lymphopenia (lymphocytes 0.3 from 1.4 2 days earlier). Nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive, thus confirming a diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient was started on levetiracetam and IV ceftriaxone, aciclovir, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. In light of the severe thrombocytopenia and risk of hemorrhage, human leukocyte antigen-matched platelets (because of known platelet HLA antibodies) were transfused intermittently to maintain the platelet count >50 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Twelve hours after admission, the patient's GCS fell to 5 (E1, V1, and M3), with associated development of an extensor left plantar response and an unreactive left pupil. Although the patient's respiratory symptoms remained relatively mild, she underwent endotracheal intubation for airway protection and was transferred to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation. Repeat head CT showed increased hypodensity and swelling of the brain stem, and a new area of cortical and subcortical hypodensity in the left occipital lobe initially suggested an acute posterior circulation infarct. A subsequent computed tomography angiogram excluded an acute vascular occlusion but showed worsening brain stem swelling with subtle intrinsic pontine hemorrhage and new symmetrical hypodensities in the deep gray matter and amygdalae (figure 1). Appearances were suggestive of a rapidly evolving encephalopathy with severe involvement of the brain stem. On the fifth day of admission, lumbar puncture was performed immediately after platelet transfusion. CSF opening pressure was 28 cm water, and CSF analysis showed increased protein concentration (2.3 g/L) and a normal white cell count of 4/mm 3 . Subsequent standard CSF virology PCR (herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, enterovirus, parechovrius, and human herpesvirus 6), CSF PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and CSF culture were negative.",

However, outside of bone marrow transplantation and active immunosuppressant therapy, there is no reported predisposition to encephalopathy in patients with aplastic anemia. 3, 4 Our patient was not lymphopenic before COVID-19, and therefore, it is unlikely that the aplastic anemia caused an impaired immune response.",

            "text": "ANE is a rare encephalopathy most frequently encountered in children and characterized by multiple, symmetrical lesions in the thalami, striatum, cerebral white matter, and brain stem. 5,6 ANE has previously been linked to several infective agents including influenza-A, herpes simplex virus, influenza-B, mycoplasma, and human herpes virus-6. 6, 7 As in this case, ANE is often rapidly progressive with seizures, reduced consciousness, and vomiting, usually occurring 12-72 hours after symptom onset of the viral infection. 5, 7 As in our case, CSF analysis frequently shows an elevated protein concentration but a normal white blood cell count. 5, 7 The precise etiology and pathophysiology of ANE remains unclear. In reported cases, the suspected causative pathogen is rarely detected in the CSF by PCR assay. 5, 7 In an autopsy of a patient with ANE secondary to H1N1 influenza, a notable absence of perivascular or meningeal inflammation was found. 6 Therefore, ANE is not believed to be a product of direct infection but the result of an immune-mediated process involving proinflammatory cytokines. 8, 9 A possible hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19 is supported by the recent observation that COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome may be driven by a macrophage activation syndrome or cytokine storm. 10 Unfortunately, in our case, testing for interleukins in the serum or CSF was not possible. Despite this, an immunemediated phenomenon, as opposed to a neurotropic effect, is suggested because CSF RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative and no other potential causative agent was identified.",
