ORF1a and ORF1ab are cleaved by papain-like protease (PLpro, nsp3) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro, nsp5) to produce the nsp [10] . Due to the important function of SARS-CoV 3CL protease, it is considered as an active target for the antiviral drug. Many 3CL protease inhibitors have been reported over the past decade [11] and a variety of inhibitors were found through screening and structure-based design [12] .

S protein, a type I glycoprotein, on the surface of the virus, can assist virus to bind to host acceptor, which has attracted great attention because of its function in receptor binding. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein is in charge of the binding to host. 72% of the amino acid sequences in the RBDs from SARA-CoV and 2019 nCoV are identical. However, as to 2019-nCoV, the rigid prolyl residues is replaced with a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues [15] .

Four functional proteins in 2019-nCoV: main protease (3CLpro), RdRp, PLpro, and spike were all studied as the targets of potential drugs. Up to now, there is no approved special antiviral drug available to be used against COVID-19. The fastest way to find drugs anti-2019-nCoV is to screen drugs which were commonly used in clinic. 4 During the treatment of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 [17] chloroquine draw great attention, which was made by Bayer in Germany in 1934 as the replacement of natural antimalarial drugs. Chloroquine was found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2 [18, 19] . The mechanism of chloroquine is inhibiting quinone reductase 2, a structural similarity of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases which is involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids. The possible interference of chloroquine with sialic acid biosynthesis could account for the broad antiviral spectrum [19] . Chloroquine can also impair early stage of virus replication by interfering with the pH-dependent endosome-mediated viral entry of enveloped viruses as well as the post-translational modification of viral proteins. But the mechanism of action of chloroquine in anti-2019-nCoV is not clear.",

Binding region of Spike proteinThe binding energy of Luteolin to the main protease was -5.37 kcal/mol, and that of N3 was -3.63 kcal/mol. The binding energy of luteolin to the active site is even smaller than that of the control molecule, indicating that luteolin has a higher binding activity. As to RdRp and Spike\uff0cLuteolin also has a smaller binding energy.From the point of view of binding energy, Luteolin shows strong interactions with the targets of new coronavirus. effective to fight against the new coronavirus. Honeysuckle and forsythia are the main antiviral drugs in the formula, and Luteolin was the main ingredient in honeysuckle. Luteolin can tightly bind to the newly-emerged coronavirus main protease. Luteolin binds to the active sites of main protease of 2019-nCOV with a lower binding energy than the ligand of the crystal structure, which implies a possible strong antiviral activity. This study will conduce to the treatment of TCM against new coronavirus. Chloroquine was an effective treatment to the new coronavirus, the binding with the main protease may be a supplement to its mechanisms of action. Luteolin can be used as a selection for new compounds specific against SARS-CoV-2 main protease sites.
