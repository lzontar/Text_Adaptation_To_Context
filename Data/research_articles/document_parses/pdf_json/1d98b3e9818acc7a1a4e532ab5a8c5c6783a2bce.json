Zhang C et al. reported a detailed discussion about liver injury in COVID-19 [1] . In fact, 14-53% of COVID-19 patients present abnormal levels of aminotransferases. The degree of liver damage depends on the severity of COVID-19. It seems that cytokine storm syndrome, ischemic hypoxia related to pneumonia and pharmacologic liver injury are the main causes of elevated liver enzymes. However, it has been demonstrated that SARS-COV-2 binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to infect the cells. In addition to lung tissue, the ACE2 receptor has also been found in cholangiocytes while the hepatocytes expressed it weakly [1] . Interestingly, it has been shown that ACE2 expression is significantly increased with chronic liver injury and cirrhosis, not only in cholangiocytes but also in hepatocytes [2] . It has been demonstrated in a mouse model after hemi-hepatectomy that ACE2 expression is upregulated during hepatocyte proliferation. Thus, nascent hepatocytes expressing ACE2 receptor could be susceptible to SARS-COV-2 infection [3] .",

It affects Kupffer-cell function and increases the concentration of liver cytokines. leukocyte-Kupffer cell interaction leads to the release of TNF\u03b1 and IL6 [4] . In a similar way, once the cascade of inflammatory reactions is triggered by SARS-COV-2 or in case of related bacterial infection, COVID-19 could be responsible for the development of PHLF. In addition, it has been found that lung injury (a common complication of COVID-19) is an independent risk factor for major morbidity and mortality after hepatectomy [5] .",

High concentrations of circulating TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were also found in post-hepatectomy infections of hematoma or bilioma [7] . Therefore, hepatectomy and post-hepatectomy infectious complications could further exacerbate the severe COVID-19 inflammatory response. Pulmonary complications are common after hepatectomy. Large subcostal incisions, prolonged surgery, intraoperative blood transfusion, vascular clamping and subsequent ischemia-reperfusion injury are risk factors for pulmonary injury [8, 9] . Moreover, the use of vasopressors, commonly used in case of Pringle maneuver and inferior vena cava clamping during hepatectomy, is a risk factor for pulmonary injury [8] . Hence, liver resections, especially major or complex hepatectomies, in COVID-19 patients could further deteriorate lung damage and complicate its management.",
