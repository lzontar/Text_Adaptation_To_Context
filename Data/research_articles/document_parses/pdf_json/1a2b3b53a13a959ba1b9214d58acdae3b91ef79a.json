Being a technique based on photons in and photons out it can also be applied at solid-liquid interfaces. Ellipsometry has therefore found many in situ applications on protein layer dynamics but studies of protein layer structure are also frequent. Numerous ex situ applications on detection and quantification of protein layers are found and several biosensing concepts have been proposed. In this chapter, the use of ellipsometry in the above mentioned areas is reviewed and experimental methodology including cell design is briefly discussed. The classical ellipsometric challenge to determine both thickness and refractive index of a thin film is addressed and an overview of strategies to determine surface mass density is given.

Their pioneering work included studies of kinetics of protein adsorption at solid/liquid interfaces. These early investigators found ellipsometry to be a suitable tool for non-destructive analysis of thin films, both ex situ as well as in situ at a solid/liquid interface, but surprisingly the use of the technique for protein adsorption studies during the last 40 years has been limited to a few laboratories. 1 In addition, with a few exceptions, the types of applications are generally very simple and often limited to single wavelength measurements. This may be due to that most users in the field have a background in biochemistry or medicine and not are sufficiently trained in optics and physics to make full use of the technique.

It is fair to say that the instrument problem is solved in this context.

In in vitro studies of protein adsorption one may always question if the model surface used is relevant. Ellipsometry has this problem in common with many other techniques but a special limitation for ellipsometry is that a relatively flat surface at least a few square mm 2 large is required. Adsorption studies on curved surfaces or small particles are not possible. Many ellipsometric protein adsorption studies are traditionally performed on silicon wafers 2 which are extremely flat and lend themselves to surface modification by silanization to change their surface chemistry, physics and energy. Another commonly used material is gold which can be modified using thiol chemistry. From an optical point of view, these two types of surfaces are excellent and provide high optical contrast to protein layers and are readily available. However, the critical question about the biological relevance should always be asked. The second challenge, evaluation of the primary data \u03a8 and , is a central problem in ellipsometry.

The evaluation problem is solved in the sense that sufficient sensitivity is obtainable to detect small amounts of adsorbed protein on a surface. However, ellipsometry is not a method for chemical identification, so chemical and biological specificity must be achieved through biorecognition. This is a central challenge but is rather a biochemical issue than an ellipsometric. The main ellipsometric challenge is on the instrumental side. There are several concepts proposed but systems suitable for clinical tests are not readily available.

Molecules always must diffuse over this layer. Magnetic stirring is often used and has the advantage that the same liquid is in the cell all the time compared to a in flow system.

Further structural studies with ellipsometry along these lines but also including multilayer adsorption were performed by Berlind et al. [32] who studied fibrinogen covalently bonded on functionalized silicon surfaces using affinity ligand coupling chemistry. Adsorption of fibrinogen was monitored in situ with ellipsometry at \u03bb = 500 nm and ellipsometric spectra were measured at steady-state in the range 350-1050 nm. Figure 2 .4 shows d and n during multistep adsorption and in situ chemical activation of fibrinogen layers evaluated on a \u03bb-by-\u03bb basis. Figure 2 .5 shows the corresponding change in \u0393 calculated with de Feijter et al.'s formula in (2.3) . Fibrinogen matrices with thickness up to 58 nm and with surface mass density \u0393 of 1.6 \u00b5g/cm 2 were prepared in this way. The first adsorption step results in a fibrinogen layer with \u0393 = 1 \u00b5g/cm 2 . A chemical activation using ethyl-3-dimethylaminopropyl-carbodiimide and N-hydroxy-succinimide (EDC/NHS) methodology was then performed with intention to promote binding of the next fibrinogen layer. However, only a small thickness increase was observed upon a second fibrinogen adsorption step. Furthermore \u0393 increases monotonically during the whole experiment and when n or d decreases, \u0393 remains constant, i.e. no desorption occurs. This thickness decrease is accompanied with an index increase supporting a densification of the fibrinogen layer. A proposed structural model for the fibrinogen layer is shown in Fig. 2 .5 and is further discussed in [32] . Earlier single-\u03bb ellipsometry experiments with ex situ activation and incubation showed very different results [42] with a considerable increase in \u0393 after each incubation step more or less proportional to the number of incubation/activation steps performed. These differences are most probably due to the drying steps in the ex situ case.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 43, "end": 47, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 879, "end": 883, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1027, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1543, "text": "(2.3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2397, "end": 2401, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2515, "end": 2519, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 262, "end": 271, "text": "Figure 2.", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1315, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1451, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2365, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Studies of Protein Layer Structure"}, {"text": "Protein molecules in a layer are normally assumed to be randomly oriented and very few protein layers are crystalline.

Sano [43] showed that structural anisotropy in BSA leads to uniaxial molecules with n of 1.744 and 1.563 along the major and minor axes, respectively. In addition there may be form induced birefringence in protein layers as briefly discussed in the methodology section above. Of course, the resolving power of ellipsometry on protein films may be insufficient to resolve their anisotropy regardless of being intrinsic or form induced.

The limited use of IRSE may be due to that the instrumentation is rather expensive and slow. With a pyroelectric DTGS detector, a typical measurement on a protein monolayer may take 12 h or more but using other types of detectors can shorten the measurement time. A rather large sample area of several mm 2 is also required. The speed and sample size can be reduced by employing synchrotron infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry as shown by Hinrichs et al. [45] .
