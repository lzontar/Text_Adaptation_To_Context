Enormous sequencing depth can be 19 necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic 20 HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for 21 virus detection in complex diagnostic samples. 22 42 (without sophisticated bioinformatics skills) can easily use the VirBait workflow. The rapid 43 extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible without 44 any problems as shown for SARS-CoV-2.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "45", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly 39 related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, 40 health sector or research question. The risk of carryover needs to be taken into consideration. 41 The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user-friendly, and even non-experts 48 3 Background 49 Disease control is encompassing several fields like powerful diagnostics for early detection, 50 efficient therapy and disease prophylaxis as for example vaccination. The present study focused 51 on broad and powerful diagnostics for viral pathogens including evolved, newly emerging or 52 unrecognized viruses. The detection of the latter can be challenging for conventional virus 53 diagnostics relying on specific quantitative PCR assays. Sequence information for such newly 54 emerging pathogens is often rare or not existing. In addition, PCR-based diagnosis of co- 55 infections with several pathogens is complicated, can be time-consuming and expensive, and 56 therefore, co-infections can easily be overseen. Moreover, pathogen detection in cases of 57 immunocompromised patients might be hampered due to a deviating course of the infection or 58 its ectopic location [1] . For all the mentioned challenges, untargeted metagenomics using high-59 throughput sequencing (HTS) offers a swift and broad solution. It also enables the simultaneous 60 detection of the genetic information of pathogens of all taxa including viruses, bacteria and 61 eukaryotic pathogens like parasites or fungi [2] . However, poor sample quality, low pathogen 62 loads and high levels of background consisting of nucleic acids of the host or accompanying 63 bacteria often lead to a detrimental pathogen/background nucleic acid ratio of the final 64 sequencing libraries [3] . Analyses of the resulting sequence datasets can be laborious and time 65 consuming and difficult to interpret, even for experts. This is especially true for pathogenic 66 viruses with rather small RNA genomes that can get lost in datasets generated from complex 67 samples. Extremely large sequence datasets and intense time-consuming analyses would be 68 necessary to compile enough meaningful information to finalize a genome of a certain 69 pathogen [4]. This significantly impedes pathogen detection causing a diagnostic gap and 70 making HTS difficult to implement in the daily routine of diagnostic laboratories. 71 The enrichment of certain pathogens prior to HTS using capture enrichment methods can help 72 to increase the target sequence information considerably, along with avoiding extensive 73 sequencing efforts, as recently reviewed by Gaudin For the purpose of improved virus diagnostics, we used RNA baits for an in-solution capture 87 assay with subsequent HTS (Fig. 1) The performance of the VirBaits set was tested for selected viruses including such with RNA and 148 DNA genomes. We mainly used infected sample material of real cases that had already been 149 sequenced for diagnostic purpose but also a spiked salmon sample from a laboratory 150 proficiency test ( Table 2) Table 4 ) only 183 declaring sample number and type (tissue sample with Trizol or already extracted RNA) 184 whereas the sample processor (C.W.) did not get any information on the samples like host, 185 virus, kind of organ or tissue or pre-diagnosis. The aim of the present study was the design and test of a virus enrichment panel, whose 261 application markedly enhances the virus signal in diagnostic metagenomics by targeted capture 262 enrichment. In general, the VirBaits approach with custom-designed kits using 80-mer RNA 263 probes was easy to apply for our purpose by just compiling the relevant virus genomes and 264 providing them to the supplier. In our opinion, it is applicable for diagnosticians who are in 265 need for bait sets to capture specific pathogens but are not proficient in bioinformatics skills 266 implementing the underlying genomes into meaningful oligonucleotides. 267 As a base for this HTS plus capture enrichment approach, we used a generic HTS workflow (Fig. 3, Table 4) were intending to design, improving diagnostic sensitivity but not necessarily leading to the 310 assembly of whole genomes. Typically, one specific read in a sequence dataset indicating a 311 pathogenic virus would be enough to call a suspicion and trigger follow-up analyses. However, 312 as shown here, the used tiling density in many cases allows for the assembly of nearly complete 313 genomes emphasizing the sensitivity of the approach. In addition, the detected SNVs of RABV 314 and KBLV genomes point to equal frequencies (Fig. 4) Table 2 ).

This SARS-CoV-2 bait set was mixed with the VirBaits set in the ratio of 1:40 to190    simulate an extended VirBaits set, and applied as described above. Different samples of CoV-2 infected ferrets (Table 2; Schlottau et al. submitted) were used for tests with of the virus in-solution capture assay (VirBaits) 196 The VirBaits panel covered 35 viral pathogens of notifiable epizootic and zoonotic diseases 197 (Table 1). The resulting bait set comprises 177,471 biotinylated RNA-baits complementary to 198 18,800 virus genomes(Fig. 2). The final number of baits in the VirBaits set among the target199 virus groups depends on the diversity of viruses comprised in the underlying genome set, the 200 number of genomes and the corresponding genome size, respectively. The highest portion of 201 baits belongs to Influenza A viruses that have small segmented single-strand RNA genomes with 202 a broad variety of genetic information that needs to be covered. Therefore, 79,859 Influenza A 203 segments sequences from 12,608 Influenza isolates were used for bait design and resulted performance was assessed via direct comparison of datasets generated with an 210 untargeted HTS approach for diagnostic reasons and datasets additionally generated from the 211 same archived libraries after treatment with the VirBaits set. The portion of virus reads 212 extracted from the metagenomics datasets using reference mapping for both datasets per 213 sample and the enrichment factor are shown (Table 2, Figure 3). In general, the effect of the 214 VirBaits treatment was very high. Two cases can be distinguished: viruses, which are comprised 215 in the bait set and viruses of which only ditant relatives are comprised in the bait set. 216 Case one, for all tested viruses that are represented in the VirBaits set, we could reach a clear 217 enrichment from 16-fold for sample L02726, slightly loaded with West Nile virus, to 9,200-fold 218 for the Rabies lyssavirus infected sample L03015 (Table 2, Figure 3). Also for viruses with large 219 DNA genomes (i.e. African swine fever virus sample L02762, Bovine herpesvirus 1 sample 220 L02568), a clear increase of virus reads could be detected after the VirBaits treatment. Likewise, 221 viruses that are only less represented in the bait set (e.g., West Nile virus 1.8%, Bovine 222 herpesvirus 1.4%, Table 1) were properly enriched (Figure 3). The additionally performed tests 223 with the complemented SARS-CoV-2 set resulted in a clear increase of coronavirus reads (9 to 224 745-fold). Nearly complete virus genomes can be assembled from many samples including 225 samples with a high host genome background and low-level viral genome loads. 226 Case two, the results vary regarding samples infected with viruses distantly related to the 227 viruses included in the underlying genome set, although related taxa of the same virus family 228 are represented in the VirBaits set. On the one hand, we found a clear enrichment for two 229 samples: sample L02374 infected with KBLV (Kotalathi bat lyssavirus, showing an overall 230 identity of 72% to RABV genomes) was enriched 26-fold, and sample L03038 infected with 231 Usutu virus (showing about 74% overall identity to WNV; compare Table 3 and Fig. 3) was 232 enriched 100-fold. On the other hand, two samples did not show any increase after VirBaits 233 treatment but were at least detectable. These are sample L02262 infected with a novel ovine 234 picornavirus (showing about 46% and 38% overall identity to SVDV and FMDV genomes in . Beside the targeted viral reads, the datasets mainly contained host-related reads 240 (Mammalia) and some bacterial reads including contaminations as typical for the used L03007, the complete Rabies lyssavirus genome assembly generated via generic HTS 244 did show the same single nucleotide variants (SNV) as the genome assembly of the virBaits 245 dataset. The variants in each genome assembly were found to exhibit nearly unaltered 246 frequencies per SNV (Fig. 4) indicating an equal extraction of Rabies virus reads using the bait 247 treatment. The same is true for the KBLV-infected sample L02374 showing two point mutations 248 with similar variant frequencies. 249 Testing of the VirBaits set with blind samples -proficiency test 250 In the proficiency test blind samples, high impact transboundary or zoonotic viruses detected in 251 the samples X1 to X4 were ASFV, FMDV, RVFV, NiV, EOV and Marburgvirus (Table 4). In sample 252 X5, no virus but instead reads related to the green monkey cell line was detected. The 253 assignments made by the sample processor (C.W.) were approved as correct by the proficiency 254 test initiator (M.B.). However, in sample X3, a small amount of NiV was detected that was not 255 supposed to be in there indicating a carryover from sample X4 indeed containing NiV. Using 256 mapping analyses of all samples against all viruses that were included in the proficiency test no 257 other indication of carryover was found in any other proficiency test dataset.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "data reflect the original sample composition in the best way [2]. This 270 generic HTS approach is a powerful tool and led to the detection of novel viruses in many cases 271 [19-22], although the initial presence of the virus can be low in some cases [19,22,23]. Indeed, 272 samples with very low pathogen (virus) content represent a typical diagnostic setting. 273 Therefore, samples with a range of genome loads including very low virus titers were used in 274 the present pilot study to mimic the realistic clinical situation. 275 The designed VirBaits panel was successfully applied for all tested viruses, especially for viruses 276 that are represented in the underlying genome set (case 1 samples). Altogether, an increase of 277 9-fold to 9,200-fold of the target sequence reads was achieved. When looking at the less 278 enriched samples (Fig. 3), it is apparent that most of them show a very high percentage of virus 279 amount in the VirBaits dataset indicating a certain saturation of the hybridization. Hence, a 280 much higher increase would not be possible for these samples. Consequently, especially the 281 low loaded samples benefit from the capture enrichment procedure. According to the myBaits 282 manual, it is highly recommended to amplify libraries before enrichment. However, since we 283 always use a PCR-free generic HTS workflow, we did not follow this recommendation and still 284 obtained good results. This is in agreement with Mamanova et al. [24], who determined a 285 severe bias when doing a PCR step before hybridization capture. The authors recommend 286 keeping library amplification to a minimum and only performing 14-18 cycles after the capture 287 hybridization especially with clinical samples exhibiting nucleic acids of lower integrity. The 288 virome capture sequencing approach for vertebrate viruses, VirCapSeq-VERT [12], relies on 289 sample pre-treatments for virus enrichment like filtration of samples, treatment of samples 290 with ribonucleases to reduce extra-viral RNA and subsequent depletion of ribosomal RNA. Our 291 study clearly shows that an amplification-and depletion-free HTS workflow is well suitable to 292 be combined with capture enrichment. In addition, the application of RNA-baits instead of DNA 293 probes leads to a high increase of the target viruses including moderately related viruses (case 294 2 samples). However, care must be taken when working with RNA baits, which are not as stable 295 as DNA probes, by avoiding contaminations with RNases during handling and assuring the 296 cooling chain. The bait amount per virus group in the entire panel was varying,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "capture enrichment as already demonstrated byMetsky et al. [13].316    A general benefit of capture approaches is that no prior decision is necessary for which 317 pathogen (virus) is sought after, i.e., which specific test system needs to be applied. This saves318 time and money by avoiding application of many laborious diagnostic techniques successively 319 until a causative agent can be suspected and confirmed. Moreover, a negative result of a PCR 320 approach can mask an undetected viral pathogen when PCR primers do not fit anymore with 321 the genome of evolved pathogens. Otherwise, with positive PCR result, co-infections with 322 several different pathogens can be overseen. For cases with atypical clinical signs or deviating 323 viral pathogens, it might be that the relevant specific diagnostics are not considered or not 324 existing, respectively. The synchronous detection of different viruses, as shown for sample 325 L03038 having a co-infection with WNV and USUV, enabled by the generic HTS approach in 326 combination with VirBaits approach is a great benefit. Compared to multiplex PCR approaches, 327 that allow the detection of several viruses or virus variants in parallel [26,27], the VirBaits 328 approach has a broader applicability and often provides sequence information of full or do laborious diagnostic tests for at least each single virus or small groups of 334 viruses. The datasets generated were relatively small but resulted in all cases in enough to 335 determine the respective pathogen without any doubt. This also indicates the potential for 336 reduction of sequencing costs when applying an enrichment method. For sample X1 infected 337 with the DNA virus ASFV, the portion of virus reads in the dataset was only low since the 338 sequencing library was made from RNA according to the standard HTS workflow [2]. In that 339 case, starting from DNA would have delivered much higher read numbers, as seen for sample 340 L02762 yielding a proper amount of African swine fever virus reads (compare", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "342sample but only in sample X4. This point to the risk of carryover that can be an issue for manual343    sample handling. Carryover contaminations typically occur in laboratories but become 344 especially visible when highly enriched samples are used, like amplicons, or bait-enriched345    samples. An automated procedure or a cartridge-based system may avoid carryover in the 346 future by excluding the \"human factor\".347    The rapid inclusion of baits and samples related to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak 348 demonstrate the high dynamics and ad-hoc adaptability of the here tested approach.The 349 results for those samples show that the VirBaits workflow can be updated very rapidly and 350 easily for viruses causing newly emerging health threats. In addition, we investigated several 351 samples related to the WNV epidemic in Germany [23,28] including two horse samples. Horses 352 are dead-end hosts for WNV and horse samples show generally lower virus titers in contrast to 353 samples of bird being reservoir hosts for WNV infection. As shown here, the VirBaits treatments 354 considerably improved the WNV detection for horse samples (L03451).355 The application of myBaits is still expensive, although sequencing costs decrease with this 356 procedure since no large data sets are necessary (compare Tables 2-4). The reduction of the 357 reaction volume by 50%, as shown here for L03007, can reduce the cost for the enrichment 358 reagents. Nevertheless, this opportunity needs to be validated in further trials and might 359 depend on the individual sample type and the contained virus. here with the dilution of the baits for IAV samples, but also other viruses with small 363 RNA genomes like FMDV, RABV, NDV (compare Fig. 2). Redundancy of the baits can be 364 decreased by removing oligonucleotides that were >90% identical to each other (in contrast to 365 95% as used for the pilot study). This decrease should still allow good hybridization results 366 considering the performance of deviating baits as shown here for KBLV, USUV, OvPiV and PeHV. 367 Pooling of multiple libraries (for cost reduction), application of reduced hybridization 368 temperatures or prolonged hybridization times (up to 48 hours) need to be investigated for 369 distantly related targets. The latter step has to go along with procedures to avoid strong 370 evaporation holding the reaction volume nearly constant during extended incubation time. RNA-baits principle for capture enrichment with a large and diverse virus panel 374 as tested here is highly suitable to improve diagnostics for viruses causing notifiable epizootic 375 and zoonotic diseases. It can be dynamically updated with new RNA-baits because of the 376 modular concept that allows the addition of new bait sets for emerging diseases. The 377 combination of a generic and manipulation-free HTS workflow with the capture approach leads 378 to an enhancement of the viral signal in terms of sequence reads in the sequence dataset 379 resulting in higher sensitivity of HTS. The identification of distantly related viruses can be 380 difficult as shown for a deviating avian bornavirus in a proficiency test for HTS bioinformatics 381 [29]. Although the problem in the mentioned study was related to bioinformatics analyses, the 382 accumulation of certain virus reads by capture enrichment can avoid overlooking pathogenic 383 viruses contained in a sample. The application of such an approach is recommendable for cases 384 of unclear clinical pictures and can replace time-consuming screenings using large panel PCR 385 diagnostics for specific single pathogens. This leads to an accelerate diagnosis and a very high 386 detection rate. Although not the primary intention, the application of the VirBaits even enables 387 the generation of nearly complete genome sequences in most cases. 388 389 Supplementary information 390 Supplementary information accompanies this paper at {link to be included upon acceptance}. high-throughput sequencing; rRNA, ribosomal RNA; dsDNA, doubles-strand DNA; dsRNA, 395 doubles-strand RNA; ssRNA, single-strand RNA; 396 Viruses: AHSV, African horse sickness virus; ASFV, African swine fever virus; BLV, Bovine 397 leukemia virus; BHV, Bovine herpesvirus 1; BoDV, Borna disease virus; BTV, Bluetongue virus; 398 BVDV, Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1, 2; CCHFV, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus; CSFV, 399 Classical swine fever virus; EEEV/VEEV/WEEV, Eastern, Venezuelan, and Western Equine 400 encephalitis virus; EHDV, Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus; EIAV, Equine infectious anemia 401 virus; EOV, Ebolavirus; FMDV, Foot-and-mouth disease virus; HeV, Hendra henipavirus; IAV, 402 Influenza A virus; KBLV, Kotalathi bat Lyssavirus; LSDV, Lumpy skin disease virus; MPoxV, 403 Monkeypox virus; NDV, Newcastle disease virus; NiV, Nipah henipavirus; OvPiV, Ovine 404 picornavirus; PeHV, Penguin alphaherpesvirus; PPRV, Small ruminant morbillivirus; RABV, 405 Rabies lyssavirus; RPV, Rinderpest virus; RVFV, Rift Valley fever virus; SARS-CoV-2, Severe acute 406 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SBV, Schmallenberg virus; SHV, Suid alphaherpesvirus 1; 407 SPoxV/GPoxV, Sheeppox/Goatpox virus; SVDV, Swine vesicular disease virus; USUV, Usutu 408 virus; VSBV-1, Variegated squirrel Bornavirus-1; VSIV.

Target enrichment with complex samples was already applied for viral [5-7], bacterial [8], 78 parasitical [9] and fungal [10] pathogens to compile full or nearly full genomes for follow-up 79 analyses. For diagnostic reasons, however, the combination of probes or RNA baits of several 80 pathogens into one set, depending on the scope, for example virus, microbiological or 81 syndromic diagnostics, is beneficial. This approach can save numberless PCR reactions, which 82 are specific for only one pathogen or pathogen groups.

In a pilot study, we selected a panel of viral pathogens for 88 notifiable epizootic and zoonotic diseases.

The resulting VirBaits set was tested 92 for a set of representatives of pathogenic viruses with diagnostic samples from already 93 examined cases instead of spiked samples. These clinical samples had, to some extent, 94 challenging low virus titers. Due to the recent worldwide SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [16], we 95 extended the bait panel for this newly emerging virus and successfully tested the set with SARS-Bait design for the targeted virus panel The aim of the study was to design a diagnostic bait set for epizootic and zoonotic viral 101 pathogens. For this purpose, virus genomes were compiled based on a curated list of complete 102 virus genomes from the viralzone website (list \"SEPT_2017\" on viralzone website [17], 103 comprising 70,352 virus genomes) for viruses causing notifiable epizootic and emerging 104 zoonotic diseases. For Influenza A (IAV), a virus with RNA genome characterized by a broad 105 genomic variety, all available IAV sequences covering full or nearly full-length segments from Influenza viruses collected from avian hosts that were available in FluDB June 2018 were taken 107 (representing 12,608 isolates). Duplicated IAV sequences were removed and the resulting set of 108 79,859 segment sequences were used as basis for bait design. The final virus genome dataset 109 comprising about 18,800 complete virus genomes for epizootic and zoonotic diseases (Table 1)was sent to Arbor Biosciences (Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) for bait design.
