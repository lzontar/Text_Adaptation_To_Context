NICE has recently issued guidelines which set out decision-making procedures for allocation of intensive care and ventilation. 1 These essentially state that factors that affect the probability of survival, such as frailty, are relevant but it eschews consideration of factors such as age, length of life, quality of life or disability. The NICE guidance represents a compromise between utilitarianism and egalitarianism, partly because of fears of discrimination under the Equality Act 2010. We argue that appealing to probability of survival may constitute indirect discrimination under the Equality Act in the same way as appealing to length of life (via age) and quality of life (via disability). In each case, what is important is that a proportionate approach is taken. We argue that instead of focussing on chance of survival, all of probability, length and quality of life ought to be relevant to allocation of resources, albeit only when they are significantly lowered. While both equality and utility are important values for distributive justice, current practice represents an unstable and incoherent compromise.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In ethics, there are two broad approaches to this problem: egalitarianism and utilitarianism. According to egalitarianism, every person should be treated equally according to need. Equal treatment for equal need. Philosopher John Harris argues that each rational person wants at least three things from health care: (i) the maximum possible life-expectancy for him or her; (ii) the best quality of life for him or her; (iii) the best opportunity or chance for him or her of getting both (i) and (ii). 2 Treating people as equals involves giving equal weight to each person's own claim. As Harris recognised, a principle of equality cannot only be selectively invoked by those with disability (on pain of itself being discriminatory) but also applies to those who happen to have poor prognoses or diseases which are expensive diseases to treat. 3 The UK National Health Service (NHS) is founded on egalitarian principles. As the first principle of the NHS constitution states, 'The service is designed to improve, prevent, diagnose and treat both physical and mental health problems with equal regard.' 4 Equality of access requires that we ignore the probability of a patient benefiting from treatment. However, this is inconsistent with accepted practice.

In wellresourced nations these decisions generally only mean that some patient may need to wait longer than others to receive treatment. But in times of crisis, like a pandemic, these decisions become more acute and the reality that there are not sufficient resources to treat everyone must be addressed.

The Equality Act 2010 provides it is unlawful to discriminate, either directly or indirectly, on the basis of protected characteristics. Two characteristics relevant to this discussion are age and disability. 21 Discrimination on the basis of age or disability occurs if a criterion or practice is applied that would mean a person of a particular age or with a disability will be placed at a particular disadvantage when compared with a person who is not of that age or does not have that disability and it cannot be shown it is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. 22 The Act applies to the provision of health services in the NHS. 23 Enactment of a policy to give preferential access to intensive care on the basis of age or lack of disability appears to be prima facie discrimination. For example, if a policy were implemented that people over the age of 80 with COVID-19 should not be admitted to ICU, people over the age of 80 will be disadvantaged on the basis of their age.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 497, "end": 499, "text": "18", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 597, "end": 599, "text": "19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1530, "text": "22", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Direct discrimination"}, {"text": "This gives rise to the question of whether a policy of not providing intensive care treatment based on age or disability during a pandemic is a 'proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim'. 24 It has been recognised in relation to age based discrimination in employment that governments should be 'accorded a margin of discretion when it comes to assessing proportionate means'. 25 Further, direct age discrimination may be justified on the basis of 'social policy objectives'. 26 Any measures must be appropriate to achieve the legitimate aim and necessary to do so, and that the gravity of the effects of the discrimination must be weighed against the importance of the legitimate aims. 27 It is possible that there will not be sufficient intensive care resources available to treat everyone who needs intensive care. This means difficult decisions will need to be made, often in a short amount of time, about who should receive the available resources. Age and disability are two factors that may indicate a reduced probability of benefitting from intensive care treatment, both in the short and long term. In the short term because intensive care treatment is less likely to return an older person or a person with other physical impairments back to a state of full health. And in the long term because older people and people with some disabilities may have a reduced life expectancy and so will survive for a shorter period of time even if they are discharged. In light of the reduced short and long term benefits relative to the rest of the population, it may be argued that discriminating on the basis of age and disability is an proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.

The aim of ensuring the benefits derived from treatments are maximised may be achieved by assessing the likely effectiveness and outcomes for each individual. Whilst age or disability may be indicative at a population level of a A more targeted and proportionate approach While it may be unlawful discrimination to exclude people over a particular age or with a particular disability from accessing treatment, this does not necessarily preclude a utilitarian approach. A utilitarian approach seeks to ensure the greatest good to the greatest number. The NICE guidance states frailty and co-morbidity should be a relevant consideration to assess the likelihood of survival, suggesting probability of survival should be considered in determining whether treatment should be provided. This would not be directly discriminatory because, although age or disability may impact an assessment of the probability of survival, it is the probability of survival that is determinative.

This could include considering the length of life available to the person.

For example if Bob was 80 and had a life expectancy of 8 years and John was 40 and had a life expectancy of 48 years, John would be provided treatment. But imagine now that Bob has a life expectancy of 8 years, while John (because he has an incurable malignancy) has a life expectancy of only 4 years, the decision would be reversed.

It could similarly be argued that this would not constitute direct discrimination because a person with a disability would be treated the same way as a person without one if they had the same quality of life. The difficulty for this position is that assessments of quality of life generally appear to be intrinsically linked to disability. For example, Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) assessments identify reduced quality of life through disability. If an assessment of quality of life was nothing more than an assessment of the level of a person's disability, then making decisions on this basis would constitute direct discrimination. However, if the assessment could be conducted on some other basis (for example the person's subjective assessment of their quality of life) or with other relevant factors, it may not necessarily constitute direct discrimination. Ultimately, this would depend on whether it was considered a proportionate, and a measure that overtly devalued the lives of people with disabilities is unlikely to be considered proportionate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Direct discrimination"}, {"text": "Although criteria based on length of life and quality of life do not necessarily constitute direct discrimination, it may be argued that making decisions on this basis constitutes indirect discrimination in relation to age and disability. Indirect discrimination occurs when a criterion or practice would place a person at a comparative disadvantage to someone who did not share the protected characteristic. 28 Decisions made on the basis of life expectancy and quality of life are indirectly discriminatory because older people and people with some disabilities will be placed at a disadvantage if those with a greater life expectancy or greater quality of life are preferred. If this argument is accepted though, it must also be recognised that making assessments on the basis of frailty to determine the probability of survival may equally constitute indirect discrimination. Older people and people with particular disabilities will be assessed as more frail and are less likely to survive COVID-19.

All three considerations appear to have the same aim, ensuring limited resources are used effectively and efficiently by ensuring the maximum possible benefit is derived. This is plainly a legitimate aim, the NHS is required to allocate resources ethically, efficiently and effectively. 29 So are the three considerations proportionate to achieving this aim? In relation to each consideration, the answer may be that it depends on the extent to which they are imposed. For example, in relation to probability of survival, it may be proportionate to prefer a person with a 90% chance of survival over a person with a 5% chance of survival, but it may not be proportionate to prefer to a person with a 40% chance of survival over a person with a 30% chance. In relation to length of life, it may be proportionate to prefer a person who is likely to live 40 years over a person who is likely to live 6 months, but it may not be to prefer a person who is likely to live 10 years over a person who is likely to live 8 years.
