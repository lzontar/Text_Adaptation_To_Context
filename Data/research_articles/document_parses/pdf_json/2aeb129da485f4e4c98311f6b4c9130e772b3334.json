Apart from better identifying the lead-lag path, the technique also gives a measure for adjudging closeness between financial time-series. Also, the proposed measure is closely related to correlation, and it uses Dynamic Programming technique for finding the optimal lead-lag path. Further, it retains most of the properties of a metric, so much so, it is termed as 'loose metric'. Tests are performed on Synthetic Time Series (STS) with known lead-lag relationship and comparisons are done with other state-of-the-art models on the basis of significance and forecastability. The proposed technique gives the best results in both the tests. It finds paths which are all statistically significant, and its forecasts are closest to the target values. Then, we use the measure to study the topology evolution of the Foreign Exchange market, as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. Here, we study the FX currency prices of 29 prominent countries of the world. It is observed that as the crises unfold, all the currencies become strongly interlinked to each other.

[13] used DTW-measure for doing such analysis of foreign exchange data. DTW measure aligns the two time-series along time, so it can also be used in cases where the two time-series are not of the same length. Also, it is costly and difficult to obtain foreign exchange currency prices of many countries for a long duration, due to different operating hours of exchanges in different countries. DTW measure can be used even if the time-series contain several missing values, without any further data pre-processing step to remove or approximate the missing values. Thus, the DTW measure provides a good alternative to correlation measure as well-argued in [13] . The proposed AC measure also has all these advantages over correlation measure. Further, the AC measure is able to better incorporate the lead-lag relationship effect into its value than DTW measure. It chooses the path along which the correlation is maximum while incorporating any information regarding the lead-lag relationship. As described in [29] , [30] , the lead-lag relationship may be existing in the foreign exchange market too, so its effect should not be ignored entirely.

The cluster contains regional Asian currencies like INR, PKR and TRY. The third cluster points towards the emergence of INR as another currency of regional importance. India is one of the fastestgrowing major economies in the world. The democratic regime in India has been slowly but steadily liberalizing the economy, which has eased the free flow of goods and services in the region.As the COVID-19 economic crises began unfolding in China, we see that USD again takes the central role in the FX currencies network of the world.
