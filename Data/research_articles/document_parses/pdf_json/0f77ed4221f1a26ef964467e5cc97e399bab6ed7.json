In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is \"complex\" because not all routes of infection can be traced, and since most of the infection takes the form of subclinical infections, the symptoms are \"ambiguous\" and its containment is not straightforward. Thus, the issues related to COVID-19 are the very same \"VUCA\" (Alkhaldi et al., 2017 ) that came to be used in the business industry in 2010s to describe situations such as \"It is difficult to predict the future because of the rapidly changing social environment\". Therefore, the global COVID-19 pandemic would force the general public to learn the \"VUCA\" era mindset. The COVID-19 pandemic embodied the ultimate world of \"VUCA,\" and the way of life in the age of VUCA is fundamental to the strategies for confronting the COVID-19 problem. Furthermore, the impact J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of the pandemic on the real economy cannot be ignored, as the real economy and individual mental health are closely related. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is a medium-to long-term battle against an \"invisible enemy,\" it will test people's ability to adapt to irreversible social change toward the New Normal.",

The only way for humanity's wisdom to confront this challenge is the digital transformation of public mental health and psychiatry through the use of IT. Countries and regions that can technologically and economically paradigm shift to a Society 5.0 world at the moment are very limited. However, countries around the world should urgently work to develop the infrastructure for the digitalization of mental health care in the future. Sooner or later, a prolonged pandemic will qualitatively change people's lifestyles. The deregulation and changes in the social system triggered by this social crisis would be a good opportunity to strategically build a post-COVID-19 digital mental health world. Specifically, industry, government, and academia must work together globally to build a platform (Barton et al., 2020) that can collect and store not only information on COVID-19 infection but also life and medical data seamlessly and ubiquitously.",
