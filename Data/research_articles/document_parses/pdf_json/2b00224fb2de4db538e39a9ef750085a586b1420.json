The new simulations show that estimated NPI efficiencies across all 11 countries change drastically unless the model is adapted to give the Swedish data special treatment. While stated otherwise in the Nature article, such adaptation has been done in the model code reproducing its results: An ungrounded country-specific parameter said to have been introduced in all 11 countries, is in the code only activated for Sweden. This parameter de facto provides a new NPI category, only present in Sweden, and with an impact comparable to that of a lockdown.",

In the second one, Report 13 [2] , released online on March 30, a method was presented to estimate the actual effects of different NPIs that at the time had been effectuated in 11 European countries. Based on the effectuation dates of the interventions and available time series of mortalities in each country, the influence of individual NPIs on the reproduction number Rt of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated from death data. Data from different countries were effectively pooled through the assumption that the NPI parameters are not country-specific: the factor of relative change in Rt resulting from effectuating a particular NPI is the same, regardless of in which country the NPI is effectuated. The factors were assumed time-independent, with the exception that a bonus factor is ascribed to an NPI if it is the first to be effectuated in a country. Some country-specific flexibility was, however, provided through the basic reproduction number R0 . In a later version of the model [9] , released April 24 (after Report 13), the lockdown NPI, being the last NPI to be effectuated in all countries, except for Sweden, was also ascribed some country-specific flexibility.",

Three exceptions apply: I: The first NPI to be effectuated in a particular country is ascribed a bonus effect, as shown by the red versus green bars in Figure 2 ; II: lockdown is ascribed a countryspecific bonus effect; III: the last NPI that is effectuated in a country, being the lockdown NPI for all countries except for Sweden, is also ascribed a country-specific bonus effect.

This is confirmed by executing the model [9] with different interventions being defined as having occurred last in the one country where lockdown was not effectuated. It is hard to judge whether, for example, a partial transition to online teaching constitutes a school closure or not. This is reflected by the model used in [2] first defining school closure to have taken place in Sweden. In a subsequent code version it was defined not to have taken place, using the above motivation, and in the code version used in [4] it had again been re-introduced. Similarly, the crowd size limit associated with the public events ban NPI remains a free design parameter for the modeller to decide. Early versions of the model code defined the public events ban to have taken place on the date where gatherings exceeding 500 persons were discouraged in Sweden. This was later changed to the date when gatherings exceeding 50 persons were discouraged. As shown in Figure 1 , the intervention defined to have been effectuated last in Sweden is different, depending on which of the mentioned definitions of school closure and public events ban is chosen. This results in either school closure, public events, or social distancing discouraged becoming defined as the last intervention to have been effectuated in Sweden. In each case, the model uses the last intervention to explain the reduction in Rt that becomes evident in the death reports collected over April and May.",

This bonus parameter provides an explanation of the decrease of Rt in Sweden, despite the absence of lockdown. Remarkably, in the ICCRT model code [9] reproducing the results in the Nature article [4] , the bonus last intervention parameter has been disabled for all countries except Sweden, de facto providing a bonus NPI parameter in Sweden for the model to use. Enabling the bonus parameter for all 11 countries, to match the wording in [4] , results in numerical issues and warnings from the MCMC engine that the posterior distributions should not be trusted.",

The authors of [4] write that they \"assess whether there is evidence that interventions have so far been successful at reducing Rt below 1\" and later hint at an affirmative conclusion by writing that they \"estimate large reductions in the reproduction number Rt in response to the combined non-pharmaceutical interventions\". We argue that it is questionable to determine the joint impact of NPIs on Rt using a model based on the assumptions that changes in Rt are de facto only driven by the NPIs. The authors seem to acknowledge this in their counterfactual analysis, by stating that \"even in the absence of government interventions we would expect Rt to decrease and therefore would overestimate the deaths in the no-intervention mode\". Yet, no serious effort to falsify the underlying hypothesis that the NPIs are the main reason for the reduction in Rt is ever presented. The closest we could find was a section of the supplement of [4] , corresponding to Section 8.4.4 of [2] , that describes an attempt to assess this assumption using a form of Gaussian process prior null hypothesis. There is, however, no reference to quantitative results, and no code to perform this experiment has been provided in [9] .",
