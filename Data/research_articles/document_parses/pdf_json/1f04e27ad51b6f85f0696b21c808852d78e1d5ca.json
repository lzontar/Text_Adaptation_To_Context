In particular, low intrinsic mortality risks on islands with reduced predator numbers and not subject to harsh winter climates may in principle support the development of stocks with extended longevity. Conversely, the conditions under which laboratory rodents are typically bred are thought to select for genotypes that produce large, rapidly maturing races with high early reproductive rates but diminished longevity. To test these ideas, and to generate new mouse stocks suitable for genetic and molecular analysis of the processes that time life-history events, we have developed speci\u00aec pathogen-free stocks from mice trapped from three distinct populations: the U.S. mainland (Idaho) and the tropical Paci\u00aec islands Majuro and Pohnpei. Mice from all three locations were found to be shorter and lighter, to have smaller litters, and to have higher faecal corticosterone levels than mice of a genetically heterogeneous stock derived from four common laboratory inbred strains. Among the wild-derived stocks, mice from Pohnpei and Majuro were signi\u00aecantly lighter and shorter than Idahoderived animals, even in populations kept from birth under identical housing conditions. Litter size and reproductive success rates did not differ signi\u00aecantly among the three wild-derived stocks. Although further work will be needed to see if, as predicted, the wild-derived stocks differ from one another and from laboratory mice in longevity, these stocks provide useful tools for genetic dissection of factors that regulate body size and reproductive success.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Islands offer unique environments compared with nearby mainlands. Ecologists have recognized this fact at least since the time of Darwin and Wallace, and have in the ensuing decades catalogued a variety of traits which frequently differ among mainland and island populations of the same, or closely-related, species. For instance,\u00afightlessness has evolved repeatedly in island populations of birds and insects (Williamson, 1981) . Island populations also frequently differ from mainland relatives in colour, behaviour, morphology, fecundity, and even longevity (Crowell & Rothstein, 1981; Williamson, 1981; Austad, 1993; Adler & Levins, 1994) . MacArthur & Wilson (1967) attributed many of these differences to adaptation to the ecological dissimilarities between islands and mainlands. Speci\u00aecally, such differences were assumed to derive from selection for traits associated with rapid population growth (r-selection) during the early phase of island colonization and subsequent selection for competitive ability (K-selection) under the typical island conditions of a more equable physical environment and consequent lower densityindependent mortality, dense populations of extant species, as well as reduced numbers of predator and competitor species. Other authors (Davis, 1983; Berry, 1996) have noted that because island colonization events constitute signi\u00aecant genetic bottlenecks, many of the differences between mainland and island populations (as well as among island populations themselves) may derive from the chance subset of mainland genotypes which island colonizers happen to possess. Insular animal populations often exhibit extremes of body size, and may be considerably larger or smaller than their closest mainland relatives (Case, 1978) . In mammals generally, a trend has been identi\u00aeed for large species to become smaller on islands and small species to become larger (Lomolino, 1985) . However, the sample of mammals from which this trend was deduced was decidedly biased toward temperate, as opposed to tropical, islands and may not hold when the effects of latitude are controlled for. For instance, in house mice Mus musculus, the mammal most broadly characterized in terms of latitudinal trends in insular body size, populations at low latitudes are frequently small (typically 9\u00b114 g: Tomich, Wilson & Lamourex, 1968; Berry, Sage et al., 1981) and at high latitudes are frequently large (20+ g: Berry, Jakobson & Peters, 1978; Barnett & Dickson, 1989) , although exceptions occur (Tomich et al., 1968; Berry & Peters, 1975) possibly as a result of founder effects and/or unusual combinations of predator or competitor species (Angerbjorn, 1986; Berry, 1996) . Because animals from populations with statistically distinct body sizes are seldom reared under standardized conditions, the extent to which observed size differences represent genetic or environmental differences is unclear.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 410, "end": 428, "text": "(Williamson, 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 561, "end": 588, "text": "(Crowell & Rothstein, 1981;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 589, "end": 606, "text": "Williamson, 1981;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 607, "end": 620, "text": "Austad, 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 621, "end": 642, "text": "Adler & Levins, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 645, "end": 670, "text": "MacArthur & Wilson (1967)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1282, "text": "(Davis, 1983;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1295, "text": "Berry, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1758, "text": "(Case, 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1908, "text": "(Lomolino, 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2347, "text": "Tomich, Wilson & Lamourex, 1968;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2348, "end": 2373, "text": "Berry, Sage et al., 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2425, "end": 2456, "text": "Berry, Jakobson & Peters, 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2457, "end": 2481, "text": "Barnett & Dickson, 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2510, "end": 2531, "text": "(Tomich et al., 1968;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2532, "end": 2553, "text": "Berry & Peters, 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2656, "end": 2674, "text": "(Angerbjorn, 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2675, "end": 2687, "text": "Berry, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Ecological conditions typical of many islands also have relevance to the evolution of ageing rate.

Litter size is conventionally assumed to vary directly with maternal body size in house mice (Roberts, 1961; Batten & Berry, 1967 ), but we found no statistically signi\u00aecant differences in litter sizes among our small sample of litters from each of the wild-derived stocks, despite the larger body size of the mainland animals. It has previously been suggested that the correlation between litter size and maternal body size may be absent among island mouse populations (Batten & Berry, 1967) . As a group, females of the wild-derived stock also tended to show delayed vaginal opening compared to DC controls, although these data should be considered preliminary until larger numbers of mice have been tested, with appropriate controls for differences in litter size. The combination of small body size, small litter size and delayed reproductive maturity are all consistent 101 Island-derived mouse stocks with the hypothesis that selective pressures in the derivation of common laboratory stocks have favoured alleles that promote the rapid production of large litters. Since small body and litter size is often associated with increased longevity within a species (Roberts, 1961; Brown-Borg et al., 1996; Li et al., 1996) , the data suggest that the wild-derived stocks may indeed prove to be longer-lived than common inbred lines and their F 1 hybrids. Our data do not address whether the populations from the two tropical islands exhibit traits speci\u00aecally adapted to insularity, per se, as opposed to some generalized adaptation to the climatic differences between temperate and tropical regions. For instance, arti\u00aecial laboratory selection over 10 generations for cold-tolerance in mice has shown that cold-tolerant animals are larger, faster growing, and have larger litters than control animals, even when reared at similar temperatures (Barnett & Dickson, 1989) . However, even if our tropical mouse stocks exhibit their speci\u00aec traits due to a generalized adaptation to warm environments, this still suggests that they have been evolving under conditions of lower environmental hazards as our hypothesis assumes, since at least in temperate regions most mortality among wild house mice is due to cold (Berry, 1981) .
