Streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention will matter not only to patients with COVID-19, but also to health-care workers and other patients who are at risk from nosocomial transmission. Management of acute respiratory failure and haemodynamics is key. ICU practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity, with a focus not just on infrastructure and supplies, but also on staff management. Critical care triage to allow the rationing of scarce ICU resources might be needed. Researchers must address unanswered questions, including the role of repurposed and experimental therapies. Collaboration at the local, regional, national, and international level offers the best chance of survival for the critically ill.",

Many lessons can be learnt from the cumulative experience of Asian ICUs dealing with the COVID-19, SARS, and MERS outbreaks. In this Review, we draw on the experience of Asian ICU practitioners from a variety of settings-and available literature on the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and related conditionsto provide an overview of the challenges the ICU community faces and recommendations for navigating these complex ities. These challenges and recommendations are summarised in tables 1 and 2.",

[11] [12] [13] [14] 16 Common CT findings are ground glass opacities and consolidation. 19, 20 Acute hypoxaemic respiratory failuresometimes with severe hypercapnia-from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most common complication (in 60-70% of patients admitted to the ICU), followed by shock (30%), myocardial dysfunction (20-30%), and acute kidney injury (10-30% In a large report, 49% of all 2087 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in China died. 21, 22 Small, single-ICU studies found mortality rates of 62% (in Wuhan, China) and 52% (in Washington, DC, USA), but these figures had not accounted for many who were still in the ICU. 15, 16 Although 97% of patients on invasive mechanical ventilation died in a multicentre study conducted early in the Wuhan outbreak, mortality is affected by local practices, and larger studies are awaited. 23 The same study reported that 53% of deaths were related to respiratory failure, 7% to shock (presumably from fulminant myocarditis), 33% to both, and 7% to unclear mechanisms. 23 Mortality is associated with older age, comorbidities (including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, and cancer), higher severity of illness scores, worse respiratory failure, higher d-dimer and C-reactive protein concentrations, lower lymphocyte counts, and secondary infections. 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, [21] [22] [23] [24] Although patients older than 60 years account for more than 80% of deaths, younger patients are not spared. 21, 22 The median time from symptom onset to death is 2-8 weeks, whereas the median time from symptom onset to clinical recovery is 6-8 weeks. 8, 18 Prediction of the trajectory of illness from symptom onset is difficult, and prognostic tools and biomarkers are urgently needed. 5 Figure 1 suggests an initial approach for ICU practitioners who are called to assess a patient with suspected COVID-19 infection. The non-specific clinical features do not easily distinguish severe COVID-19 from other causes of severe community-acquired pneumonia. 25 WHO suggests that COVID-19 be suspected in patients with acute respiratory illness and fever, plus travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission, or contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case in the 14 days before symptom onset; and in patients with severe acute respiratory illness who require hospitalisation without an alternative diagnosis that fully explains the clinical presentation. 26 Given the exponential rise in the number of areas with community transmission worldwide and the substantial risk of missing cases early in a local outbreak, 9 ICU practitioners should increasingly have a high index of suspicion and a low threshold for diagnostic testing for any patient with severe acute respiratory infection, where available.",

[11] [12] [13] 15 Minimal data exist to confirm or refute safety concerns regarding the risk of aerosol generation by these devices. Epidemiological data suggest that NIV was associated with nosocomial transmission of SARS; 34 however, human laboratory data suggest that NIV does not generate aerosols. 35 Suggestions that HFNC might be safe are questionable: studies that might be taken to support the safety of HFNC were not designed to show whether or not HFNC is aerosol generating and did not examine the spread of viruses. 36, 37 Moreover, although NIV might reduce intubation and mortality in mild ARDS, 38 it is associated with higher mortality in moderateto-severe ARDS from multiple causes, 39 and a high risk of failure in MERS. 40 Although weak evidence suggests that HFNC might reduce intubation rates without affecting mortality in unselected patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, 41 delayed intubation as a consequence of its use might increase mortality. 42 Thus, NIV and HFNC should be reserved for patients with mild ARDS until further data are available, with close monitoring, airborne precautions, and preferably use of single rooms.

The number of assistants should be limited to reduce exposure. Bagmask ventilation, which generates aerosols, should be minimised by prolonged pre-oxygenation; a viral filter can be placed between the exhalation valve and the mask. 43 Rapid sequence induction with muscle relaxants will reduce coughing.

During the Ebola outbreak, WHO experts concluded that due to \"exceptional circumstances\", it was \"ethically acceptable to offer unproven interventions that have shown promising results in the laboratory and in animal models but have not yet been evaluated for safety and efficacy in humans as potential treatment or prevention\". 90 During the SARS outbreak, however, ribavirin was widely used, but was subsequently found to be at best ineffective and at worst harmful. 58 Although expert guidance can be sought from local or international societies, patients treated with experimental therapies should be enrolled in a clinical study when possible.",

Although some clinicians have suggested the additional use of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)-given accounts of health-care workers acquiring SARS despite wearing N95 respirators, and available albeit limited evidence that PAPRs result in less contamination of health-care workers 43 -their use comes with significant logistical challenges. 93 There are several pitfalls related to PPE. Close attention to the supply chain is needed given the global shortage of medical masks and respirators. 5,6,94 Reuse between patients and use beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life might be required. 95 Fit testing-preferably done before outbreaks-is crucial and should be regularly performed as facial contours change with time. 96 Non-N95 reusable masks with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters that do not require fit testing might be considered. 96 Although health-care workers often focus on donning PPE, data suggest a substantial risk of self-contamination when doffing PPE. 97 Training on the specific steps of wearing and removing PPE, together with hand cleansing, is crucial, and references for these procedures are widely available. 98 Not efficacious for Ebola virus disease compared with other investigational therapies; 67 superior activity compared with lopinavirritonavir in mice with MERS-CoV; 68 effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV in vitro 69, 70 No peer-reviewed, published safety data available for SARS-CoV-2; in the PALM trial, only 1 of 175 patients randomised to remdesivir had a potentially serious adverse event (hypotension during a loading dose followed by cardiac arrest, possibly due to remdesivir or to fulminant Ebola virus disease itself) 67",

National and regional modelling of needs for intensive care is crucial. 9,10 Many countries might not have enough ICU beds in the first place, let alone isolation or single rooms. The median number of critical care beds per 100 000 population was 2\u00b73 in ten low-income and lower-middle-income countries, 4\u00b76 in five uppermiddle-income countries, and 12\u00b73 in eight high-income countries in Asia in one analysis, 108 and 9\u00b76 in 28 highincome countries in Europe in a 2012 report. 109 China, an upper-middle-income country, has 3\u00b76 critical care beds per 100 000 population, 108 and Wuhan was initially overwhelmed by COVID-19\u00b7 5,6,15 Italy, a high-income country with 12\u00b75 critical care beds per 100 000 population, 109 continues to struggle with the outbreak. 9,10,110 By contrast, a low-income country such as Uganda has only 0\u00b71 critical care bed per 100 000 population. 108, 111 This raises serious concerns about the ability of resource-limited settings to manage critically ill patients with COVID-19. 112 Most countries cannot match China's feat of rapidly building new hospitals and ICUs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. 15 Surges in the number of critically ill patients with COVID-19 can occur rapidly. Thus, ICU practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must plan in advance for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity. 9,10,113 Adding beds into a pre-existing ICU is a possibility, but space constraints and nosocomial transmission from crowding limit this option. 6 Other options include the provision of intensive care outside ICUs, such as in high-dependency units, remodelled general wards, post-anaesthesia care units, emergency departments, or deployable field units (figure 1). 6,113 Another option is the transfer of patients to designated hospitals and ICUs. Although the centralisation of expertise and resources might improve outcomes and efficiency, these benefits must be weighed against the risks of inter-hospital transfer. 6,9 The sustainability of depending on a few centres, or scarcity thereof, even as the outbreak worsens must be considered.",

Although many are trials of repurposed or experimental therapeutic agents, other more basic questions that are equally crucial should be addressed through research. Some of these questions have been listed as potential challenges in tables 1 and 2. The short-term and long-term prognoses of critically ill patients have to be clarified. Data on the effectiveness of NIV and HFNC, and the associated risk of viral transmission, remain scarce. [34] [35] [36] [37] The risk of nosocomial transmission in shared ICU rooms should be studied. More data on cardiac involvement and myocardial dysfunction are needed. 11, 13, 15, 16, 23 The role of ECMO is unclear. 49 The indications for corticosteroids should be crystallised, while considering interactions between different therapies. 61 For example, although limited by confounding from differences in baseline severities, a post-hoc analysis of a non-COVID-19 ARDS trial suggested that beta-interferon use was associated with higher mortality compared with placebo in patients receiving corticosteroids, but not in those who were not on corticosteroids. 123 Multiple challenges to research exist during pandemics. First, the surge of disease often outpaces the traditional steps for research, including protocol design, securing of funding, and ethics approval, all amidst busy clinical work. Pre-approved adaptable plans drawn prior to an outbreak are useful. For example, several interventions against SARS-CoV-2 are being incorporated into the Randomized, Embedded, Multi-factorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP), a pre-approved platform trial for severe community-acquired pneumonia.",

To this end, pandemics provide a great opportunity for collaboration. Platforms such as the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) and the International Forum for Acute Care Trialists (InFACT)-formed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic-enable large research networks to share common goals and standardise data collection globally. 124 WHO has also produced a master protocol for trials on experimental therapeutics for COVID-19. 125 Last, the pace of research and data sharing must be balanced with scientific quality and ethical integrity. China's rapid sharing of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic code had an Review immediate impact on case identification, isolation, and the spread of the virus. 126 The COVID-19 pandemic also saw a ballooning of the number of preprints (manuscripts openly posted online before peer review). During the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, the median time between preprints and peer-reviewed publication was 150 days. 127 Although preprints rapidly provide new knowledge, ICU practitioners should be aware of the potential compromise in data quality when the conventional peerreview process is bypassed. A systematic review also found that only 50% of Ebola intervention studies fully complied with frameworks for ethical trial conduct. 128",

Even if SARS-CoV-2 infects a small proportion of the 7\u00b78 billion people on Earth, many thousands will still become critically ill and require ICU care. The ICU community must brace itself for this potentially overwhelming surge of patients and optimise workflows, in advance, for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention. Hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must work with ICU practitioners to prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity. They must protect health-care workers from nosocomial transmission, physical exhaustion, and mental health issues that might be aggravated by the need to make ethically difficult decisions on the rationing of intensive care. Researchers must address key questions about what remains a poorly understood disease. Collaboration at the local, regional, national, and international level-with a focus on highquality research, evidence-based practice, sharing of data and resources, and ethical integrity in the face of unprecedented challenges-will be key to the success of these efforts.",
