These recommendations have stood the test of time but are based more on common sense than scientific investiga- Strombeck and Guilford (1990) tions. Fasting the animal for a short period provides bowel 'rest'. This has traditionally been considered of prime importance in the treatment of most gastrointestinal problems although it has been recently challenged in the treatment of diarrhoea. In problems of acute onset, bowel rest is accomplished by completely restricting the oral intake of food. A 'bland' diet is defined as one without coarse and spicy foods. Most commercial food could, therefore, be thought of as 'bland'. One theoretical justification for not feeding a vomiting dog or cat its usual diet is the observation in humans that acquired food allergies to proteins eaten during acute gastroenteritis can delay recovery (Iyngkaran and others 1978, Gryboski 1991) . There is clinical and gastroscopic food sensitivity testing evidence to suggest that the same phenomenon also occurs in the cat and dog. Acquired food allergies to novel protein sources, such as chicken or cottage cheese, temporarily introduced into a vomiting animal's diet are not as problematical as acquired allergy to a dietary staple such as beef.",

Most authorities recommend a 'bland' diet even though there is little evidence to support the recommendation (Pemberton and others 1988) . Milk, which was recommended in the past as a buffering/coating agent, fell from favour because of concern about the stimulatory effects on gastric acid secretion of calcium and protein in milk (Pemberton and others 1988) . However, interest in milk feeding is now undergoing a resurgence because of evidence that intragastric administration of lipid emulsions improves the hydrophobicity of the gastric mucosal barrier (Lichtenberger 1993 ). Frequent small feedings may provide relief of clinical signs but have not been shown to hasten healing of the mucosa (Pemberton and others 1988) . Liquidising the diet will hasten gastric emptying, reducing gastric acid secretion. Minimising the protein content of the food may also reduce gastric acid secretion. The buffering action of insoluble fibre and its acceleration of gastric emptying may, one day, be proven to be valuable.",

            "text": "Feeding through diarrhoea (with sufficient solid or semi-solid food to satisfy the approximate caloric requirements) has recently proven beneficial in infants with acute diarrhoea. Feeding through diarrhoea maintains greater mucosal barrier integrity and helps minimise malnutrition, usually without prolonging the duration of diarrhoea (Isolauri and others 1989, Snyder and others 1990) . At first sight these observations might encourage veterinary clinicians to feed their diarrhoeic patients. Caution is required, however, before the tried-and-true 'no food per 0s' recommendation is abandoned in dogs and cats with diarrhoea. Most of the studies showing beneficial effects of feeding through diarrhoea were performed in humans affected by secretory diarrhoeas due to toxigenic organisms such as cholera (Snyder and others 1990) . Feeding through was less successful in children with severe diarrhoea or those with rotavirus infection (Snyder and others 1990) which produces an osmotic diarrhoea. Osmotic diarrhoeas due to viral infections (parvovirus, coronavirus, rotavirus, etc) and dietary indiscretions are more common in dogs and cats than are secretory diarrhoeas. Furthermore, daily stooling frequency was increased in several studies of humans fed during diarrhoea (Snyder and others 1990 ). This may not be of major consequence to humans (provided duration of the diarrhoea is not extended) but can be disastrous to the owner of a pet that is passing diarrhoea in the house. Consequently, feeding through diarrhoea is likely to be less successful in veterinary practice than the current recommendation of 'no food per 0s'.",

Furthermore, if the constituents of the hyperosmolar diet are not readily absorbed, osmotic diarrhoea will develop. Hyperosmolarity is most often of concern when feeding excessive amounts of hyperosmolar liquid elemental diets that can rapidly exit into the highly permeable duodenum.",

Other carbohydrates that can be used include corn, potatoes or tapioca. These are all 'gluten-free'. Potato and tapioca starches are less digestible than rice starch, however (Schunemann and others 1989). Corn starch is very well digested (Schunemann and others 1989) but because corn is widely used in pet foods the prevalence of allergies to corn proteins is likely to be higher than that of rice.

Furthermore, acquired allergy (resulting from abnormal food antigen exposure due to gastrointestinal inflammation) to an infrequently fed protein is less significant than acquired allergy to a dietary staple. Suitable protein sources for dogs include cottage cheese, tofu, eggs, chicken, venison, lamb and rabbit but any other highly digestible meat not commonly included in the animal's diet is likely to be well tolerated. Staple protein sources vary in different geographical areas; for example, mutton is a staple protein in Australasia and is therefore not a suitable novel protein source in that part of the world. Cottage cheese is advantageous because it contains less lipid than eggs and meat. Cottage cheese is less palatable in cats than in dogs but chicken, turkey, fish and liver (provided liver is not fed continuously) are readily accepted alternatives.",

To avoid recurrence of clinical signs due to acquired allergy the dietary protein source can be changed after the first six weeks of therapy.

Other authors have recommended the use of fibre, with some finding success with fermentable fibres such as psyllium (hemicellulose) and others preferring non-fermentable fibres such as bran (Simpson 1992 ). I prefer a diet containing moderate amounts of a highly digestible protein that is not included in the animal's usual diet, in order to reduce colonic ammonia generation and lower dietary antigenicity, in combination with a soluble fibre such as psyllium or soy fibre. The beneficial effect of the soluble fibres probably relates to the generation of volatile fatty acids that nourish the colonic epithelium and discourage growth of pathogens.",
