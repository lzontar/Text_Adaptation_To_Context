Computed tomographies (CT) of the lungs are effective for assessing the state of the infection. Unfortunately, labeling CT scans can take a lot of time and effort, with up to 150 minutes per scan. We address this challenge introducing a scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system that accelerates the labeling of CT scan images. Conventionally, active learning methods require the labelers to annotate whole images with full supervision, but that can lead to wasted efforts as many of the annotations could be redundant. Thus, our system presents the annotator with unlabeled regions that promise high information content and low annotation cost. Further, the system allows annotators to label regions using point-level supervision, which is much cheaper to acquire than per-pixel annotations. Our experiments on opensource COVID-19 datasets show that using an entropybased method to rank unlabeled regions yields to significantly better results than random labeling of these regions. Also, we show that labeling small regions of images is more efficient than labeling whole images. Finally, we show that with only 7% of the labeling effort required to label the whole training set gives us around 90% of the performance obtained by training the model on the fully annotated training set.

Implementation Details Our methods use an Imagenetpretrained VGG16 [49] FCN8 network [34] . Other Imagenet-pretrained architectures can be used as well, but we did not observe a difference in the results compared to other architectures such as UNet [41] and PSPNet [59] . We ran the active learning procedure for 100 cycles. In the first cycle, 5 CT images were randomly sampled from the unlabeled pool and all their regions were labeled based on the required supervision level. Each image is divided into 64 equally-sized non-overlapping regions. In each cycle, 5 images are sampled from the unlabeled pool and for each of these images, a single region gets selected for labeling. The maximum number of training epochs in a cycle is 40. The score is reported on the test set and it corresponds to the model that achieved the best score on the validation set. The models are trained with a batch size of 1 using the ADAM [27] optimizer with a learning rate of 10 \u22124 . To compute the uncertainty scores of an image, we perform Monte-Carlo with samples following the procedure in Gal and Ghahramani [19] . The dropout rate was set to 0.5.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 811, "end": 815, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 829, "end": 833, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 993, "end": 997, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1009, "end": 1013, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1669, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1845, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Region-Selection methods."}, {"text": "We evaluate our system on two open source datasets (COVID-19-A/B) whose statistics are shown in Table 1 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 96, "end": 103, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Datasets"}, {"text": "consists of 9 volumetric COVID-19 chest CTs in DICOM format containing a total of 829 axial slices.

Figure 6 shows that the region size can have a strong impact on the dice performance. Thus, it is important to carefully choose the right region size when using the presented active learning system.

The reason is that the annotations might not be placed in the location that could provide the most informative content for the model.

Using entropy-based MCMC, this scheme encourages labeling highly informative regions that maximize the model's validation accuracy. The second idea is to use point-level supervision which is much cheaper to acquire than per-pixel labels. Since this labeling scheme requires the annotator to label each infected region with a single click, it only requires 3 seconds per infected region. Our results show that entropy-based heuristics outperform random selection of regions with respect to the dice score and labeling effort. Moreover, we show that region-based annotation outperforms whole image labeling in terms of cost efficiency. As a result, our system reaches around 90% of the dice score of the same model trained on the whole training set with only 7% of the effort.

For each bar in the plot, the number of regions defines the number of equally-sized non-overlapping rectangles that divide the training images (see rectangle grid inFigure 3).
