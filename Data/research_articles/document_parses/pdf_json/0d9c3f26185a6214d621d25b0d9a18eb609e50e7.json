(HEPATOLOGY 2015;61:437-446) H epatitis C virus (HCV) is a causative agent of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therapy for chronic hepatitis C has markedly progressed following the recent approval of direct-acting antiviral agents, which can be administered in addition to standard care with pegylated interferon (IFN)-a plus ribavirin. 1, 2 However, the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases caused by HCV infection remains to be well elucidated. For instance, what type of host responses induced by HCV infection contribute to HCV pathogenesis, and what is their mechanism of action? An analysis of HCV-induced changes in the host transcriptome may help resolve these issues. The responses of Huh7 cells infected with HCV have been examined in vitro, [3] [4] [5] while the in vivo liver responses of chimpanzees and patients with acute resolving and chronic HCV infection have been examined. [6] [7] [8] [9] HCV infection elevates IFN-stimulating genes (ISGs), much more notably in vivo than in vitro, but not in Huh7.5 cells that are defective in their response to IFN because of a mutation in retinoic acid-inducible gene I. 3, 5 The analysis of the gene expression profiles of these cells revealed not only the antiviral responses of proinflammatory and proapoptotic signaling, but also proviral responses required for HCV replication and secretion at the cellular level. This complex virus-host interaction may be relevant to the pathogenesis of HCV infection, including steatosis, fibrosis, and persistence. The analysis of the tissue-level responses to HCV infection in vivo identified genes responsive to HCV infection, including those promoting inflammatory cell infiltrations and the IFN response. [6] [7] [8] [9] Using the differential hybridization of complementary DNA (cDNA) library, we also isolated two ISG genes that were markedly up-regulated in chimpanzee livers during the acute phase of HCV infection: major histocompatibility complex, class I, C, and IFN-a-inducible protein 6. 10 Thus, it is clear that the IFN response is actually activated by HCV infection in vivo, and various downstream responses contribute to HCV-host interaction. Currently, ISGs (including those mentioned above) have been investigated in detail, and their roles as critical molecules in intra-and extracellular innate immunity against HCV infection are becoming clear. 11, 12 However, there remain differentially expressed genes whose functions are unknown.",

To identify the critical factors responsible for HCV control in the human liver, it is useful to determine the subtle differences in the host responses to different HCV loads in the liver, rather than the marked differences between human livers with and without HCV infection. To achieve this, we investigated the differences between human livers with chronic hepatitis containing high or low loads of HCV. By comparing gene expression profiles between livers containing quite different HCV loads, we focused on the limited, more critical factors that govern the HCV-host interaction in vivo. After verifying the differential gene expression between the two groups of liver samples, the functions of genes with potential anti-or proviral effects were analyzed during HCV infection. In this study, we identified 26 genes that were up-regulated in livers with high HCV loads. Among several genes with unknown functions in HCV infection, we characterized transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) as a new host factor activating HCV infection.",

Of the 59 patients with chronic hepatitis, but no liver cirrhosis, were subjects belonging to the HCV-high (9 cases) and HCV-low groups (8 cases; Supporting Table 1 ). HCV-negative liver samples were obtained from the nontumorous liver tissues of 5 patients with hepatic metastases of colon cancer. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Our study protocol was previously approved by the ethics committee of our school in accord with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. Huh7-25-CD81 cells 13 and Japanese fulminant hepatitis 1 isolate (JFH-1) HCV subgenomic replicon cells 14 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), containing 400 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL of G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), respectively.",

To investigate anti-and proviral host responses to HCV infection of human livers, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to examine the differential gene expression between two groups of liver samples, containing high and low HCV loads. To exclude the involvement of other variables, we divided nontumorous liver tissues into two groups, one with and one without liver cirrhosis, which were obtained from patients with chronic hepatitis in the early stages of HCC. HCV load differed markedly (>100-fold) between the two groups, but the clinicopathological features were not significantly different according to the statistical analyses (Supporting Tables 1 and 2) . We identified candidate genes from livers with chronic hepatitis in the presence or absence of liver cirrhosis and verified 26 genes that were up-regulated in livers with high HCV loads using chronic hepatitis livers without liver cirrhosis (Supporting Fig. 1 ; Supporting Table 5 ). Of the 26 genes, seven were ISGs; OASL (2 0 -5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase-like), an ISG of unknown function, inhibited HCV replication in vitro, as described previously. 15 Thus, most genes that were up-regulated in the HCV-high group were related to an antiviral response. However, it is not known whether several genes are associated with anti-or proviral responses or how they function during infection. Among the genes up-regulated in the HCV-high group (Supporting Table 5 ), we focused on TMPRSS2, which is a member of the hepsin (HPN) subfamily of type II transmembrane serine proteases. 21 TMPRSS2 was one of the top three most differentially expressed genes in addition to OASL and HLA-DQA1; these genes had the lowest P value (<0.003 by Mann-Whitney's U test) and showed a more than 3-fold change. Because the current understanding of the physiological functions of type II transmembrane serine proteases has highlighted their contribution to human disease, it seemed important to determine whether TMPRSS2 is involved in the life cycle of HCV or its pathogenesis. Up-regulation of TMPRSS2 in HCV-high livers, compared with HCV-low and HCV-negative livers, was confirmed by qPCR (Fig.  1A) . The TMPRSS2 protein was also highly expressed in the HCV-high liver, as shown by immunohistochemistry (IHC); it was localized heterogeneously in liver tissue and strongly positive at the apical membrane of hepatocytes (Fig. 1B) .",

To investigate the involvement of the cellsurface trypsin-like serine protease in HCV infection in vitro, we analyzed HCV infectivity by inoculating JFH-1 HCVcc for 2 hours in the presence of several different protease inhibitors, followed by removing the inoculum and culturing for a further 2 days. Among the inhibitors to five classes of proteases, only serine protease inhibitors, including a1-antitrypsin, SBTI, and AEBSF, inhibited the infectivity in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2) . To confirm the role of trypsin-like serine proteases on the cell surface in an early stage of HCV infection, HCVcc were inoculated in the presence of trypsin. HCV infectivity was enhanced up to 2-fold by 0.2 mg/mL of trypsin (Fig.  2) , which had no effect on cell morphology. To determine which step during the early stage of infection (attachment or entry of HCVcc to the cells) was inhibited by SBTI, HCVcc were incubated with cells at 4 C for the first hour for attachment, and then, after removing the HCVcc inoculum, cells were incubated at 37 C for a further hour to allow entry (Fig. 3A) . Then, cells were incubated for 1 day to determine HCV infectivity by IF staining of HCV-positive cells. Even when SBTI was present only during the second 1-hour step of entry, most of the HCV infectivity was inhibited (Fig. 3Ac) . HCV replication postentry was not inhibited by SBTI (Fig. 3Ae,3B) . These results suggest that the trypsin-like serine protease is involved at an early stage of infection, particularly during entry of HCVcc into cells. SBTI also inhibited HCV infection, to some extent, with chimeric viruses containing other genotypes 3a and 1b of structural genes, which was not statistically significant (Supporting Fig. 3) .",

We asked what type of cell-surface serine proteases are expressed in Huh7-25-CD81 cells and whether the expression of these proteases are increased or decreased by HCVcc infection. We determined the mRNA levels of 10 transmembrane serine proteases pre-and postinfection with JFH-1 HCVcc. FURIN and HPN were expressed in Huh7-25-CD81 cells, but TMPRSS2 was absent (Fig. 4A) . FURIN mRNA was up-regulated 2-fold after infection with HCVcc (Fig.  4A) . On the other hand, normal human livers predominantly expressed four proteases. HPN was the most abundant, followed by FURIN, TMPRSS6, and TMPRSS2 in descending order (Supporting Fig. 4) . Only TMPRSS2 was up-regulated in HCV-high livers (Supporting Fig. 4 and Fig. 1 ). Cell-surface serine proteases in Huh7-25-CD81 cells were measured using synthetic fluorogenic substrates containing various amino acid sequences of P3-P2-P1 in the cleavage site (Fig. 4B ). The highest protease activity was against QSR. The activities against QAR, QRR, FSR, and RVRR were of similar levels and less than half that of QSR. The substrate specificity profile of the Huh7-25-CD81 cells was quite different from that of pancreatic trypsin (Fig. 4B) . Knockdown of FURIN and HPN by their respective siRNAs had no effect on the focus formation of infected cells (Supporting Fig. 5 ). These , and HCV-high (High) groups. mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR using a standard curve from serial dilution of standard cDNA. The quantity of TMPRSS2 was normalized against that of 18S rRNA and is expressed in arbitrary units.

Brown, immunostain for TMPRSS2 with DAB; blue, counterstain for nuclei with hematoxylin; bar, 50 mm. Fig. 2 . HCV infectivity in the presence of protease inhibitors and trypsin. Huh7-25-CD81 cells were inoculated with JFH-1 HCVcc in the presence of various protease inhibitors (against serine protease, cysteine protease, metal protease, aspartate protease, and aminopeptidase) and trypsin at the concentrations indicated. After 2 hours, the inoculum was removed and the cells were cultured in fresh complete medium for 2 days. HCV infectivity was determined by the number of foci containing HCV-positive cells. The control experiment was conducted in the absence of inhibitors and trypsin, and infectivity is expressed as 100%. Each experiment was performed in duplicate, and two independent experiments gave the same result. The results are expressed as the mean 6 standard error of a representative experiment. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 by the Student t test, respectively. results suggest that a serine protease other than FURIN and HPN is involved in the susceptibility of Huh7-25-CD81 cells to HCV infection.",

To investigate whether TMPRSS2 is involved in HCV infection, we established stable Huh7-25-CD81 cell clones producing WT TMPRSS2 and inactive mutant TMPRSS2 (S441A) (Fig. 5A,B) . The cell-surface proteases of the TMPRSS2-WT clones were specifically activated against the substrates, QAR and QGR, putative substrates of TMPRSS2, but not the proteases of the TMPRSS2-mutant and -negative control clones (Fig. 5C ). When influenza A virus HA was introduced Fig. 3 . SBTI inhibited an early stage of HCV infection. (A) Two steps of HCV binding and entry were separated by incubation at 4 C and 37 C, respectively. Huh7-25-CD81 cells were precultured for 1 day, and JFH-1 HCVcc were inoculated in the presence or absence of 1 mg/mL of SBTI at 4 C for 1 hour. After removing the inoculum, the cells were incubated with fresh complete medium in the presence or absence of 1 mg/mL of SBTI at 37 C for 1 hour. Then, after removing the SBTI, the cells were cultured in fresh complete medium for 24 hours and HCV infectivity was determined as described in Fig. 2. (a) Control experiment without SBTI. (b) SBTI at the binding step. (c) SBTI at entry. (d) SBTI at both steps. (e) SBTI after inoculation. Two independent experiments gave the same result, and a representative is shown. Data are shown as the mean 6 standard error in duplicate experiments. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 by the Student t test, respectively. (B) HCV RNA replication in HCV replicon cells after treatment with various concentrations of SBTI. HCV replicon cells were treated with SBTI (0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/mL) at 37 C for 2 hours. After removing SBTI, cells were incubated with fresh complete medium for 2 days. HCV RNA was determined at four time points and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression by a relative quantitation method. Relative HCV RNA was expressed as a ratio to that of replicon cells before treatment with SBTI. Fig. 4 . mRNA expression of transmembrane serine proteases and cell-surface serine protease activity in Huh7-25-CD81 cells. (A) mRNA levels of the following 10 serine proteases were quantified by qPCR: type I serine protease (FURIN); HPN/TMPRSS2 subfamily, type II (HPN, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS3, and TMPRSS4); matriptase subfamily, type II (TMPRSS6, TMPRSS9, and suppression of tumorigenicity 14 [ST14]); CORIN subfamily, type II (CORIN); HAT subfamily, type II (human airway trypsin-like protease; HAT). HCV (1) cells were prepared by inoculating JFH-1 HCVcc (4 3 10 6 HCV RNA copies) to Huh7-25-CD81 cells (2 3 10 4 , precultured for 1 day) and culturing in fresh complete medium for 6 days with one passage. HCV (2) cells were not infected and cultured in the same way. Relative gene expression is expressed as a percentage ratio of the expression of the target gene to that of glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase.

(B) Cell-surface serine protease activity of Huh7-25-CD81 cells was measured using the various peptide analog-MCA substrates. The fluorescence released was determined for 3 hours and was normalized against the cell number determined by MTT assay. The protease activity of 20 ng per mL of pancreatic trypsin was also measured against the same peptides for 30 minutes. Data are shown as the mean 6 standard error in duplicate experiments. by transfection of the expression plasmid into the cell clones, HA induced cell-to-cell fusion only in the TMPRSS2-WT cell clones 18 and 25 (Fig. 5D,E) . The fusion depended on TMPRSS2 activity and was not induced in the TMPRSS2-mutant and -negative cell clones. However, trypsin treatment induced cell fusion in the TMPRSS2-mutant and -negative cell clones. Immunoblotting of TMPRSS2 showed WTdependent autocleavage of TMPRSS2; a 24-kDa peptide was generated from the C-terminal active domain in TMPRSS2-WT cell clones, but not in the TMPRSS2-mutant cell clones (Supporting Fig. 6) . Thus, TMPRSS2-WT cell clones showed functional protease activity against synthetic peptides in vitro and native substrates in vivo. HCV infectivity was also enhanced in a WT-dependent manner by the TMPRSS2-positive cell clones. TMPRSS2-WT cell clones were more sensitive to HCV infection than the TMPRSS2-mutant and -negative cell clones (Fig. 5F ).",

            "text": "We found that 26 genes were significantly elevated in nontumorous, noncirrhotic livers with chronic hepatitis containing high HCV loads, compared with those containing low HCV loads (Supporting Table 5 and Supporting Fig. 1 ). Unexpectedly, well-known antiviral genes were rather highly expressed in livers with HCVhigh loads, including ISGs, inflammation/immune response-related genes, and anti-viral genes. For example, a markedly up-regulated and typical ISG, OASL (Supporting Table 5 ), the function of which was initially unknown, inhibited replication of JFH-1 HCVcc, as described previously. 15 Interestingly, epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes 22, 23 are notably up-regulated (Supporting Table 5 ), because an active EMT state was inhibitory to tight junctionmediated viral infection, such as measles virus infection, 24 and, most likely, for HCV infection. Thus, our comparative study showed that among two possible host responses to HCV infection and anti-and proviral responses, the antiviral response was the chief response in livers with high HCV loads. Antiviral responses are considered to result from high HCV loads, whereas proviral responses are a cause of high HCV loads. The persistence of high HCV loads may be caused by an unknown proviral mechanism by which the response is not sufficient to reduce HCV loads. Only six genes, including 4 ISGs, overlapped with previous studies that compared HCV-negative and -positive livers (Supporting Table 5 ). 6, 8, 9, 25, 26 The genes first identified in this study are useful in elucidating the mechanisms of HCV control and persistence in the human liver. Genes such as TMPRSS2, whose roles are unknown in HCV control or persistence, remained to be described. We asked how TMPRSS2, which was quite significantly upregulated in HCV-high livers, was associated with HCV infectivity in vitro.",

            "text": "We demonstrate here that trypsin-like serine proteases are involved in the early stage of HCV infection, and that TMPRSS2 activates HCVcc infection in vitro. TMPRSS2 is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family 21 and an activating protease in the airway epithelium for influenza virus infection. TMPRSS2 cleaves the surface glycoprotein, HA, to produce a fusion peptide and, so, facilitates the spread of the virus. [27] [28] [29] [30] Thus, tissue expression of TMPRSS2 affects viral pneumotropism and pathogenicity. Recently, TMPRSS2 has also been shown to contribute to the spread of other respiratory viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and parainfluenza viruses, by cleaving the viral spike protein and F protein, respectively, leading to cell-tovirus and cell-to-cell fusion. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] Current reports using TMPRSS2-knockout mice indicate that TMPRSS2 is essential for influenza virus pathogenesis in mice. [36] [37] [38] It is not known yet what the target protein of TMPRSS2 is in HCV infection or whether fusion activity is induced. TMPRSS2 is preferentially localized at the apical membrane of hepatocytes in human livers with high HCV loads (Fig. 1B) , and TMPRSS2induced protease activity was detected at the surface of Huh7 cells (Fig. 5C) . Therefore, TMPRSS2 might also be involved in HCV entry or spread at or close to the tight junctions of hepatocytes in the human liver, where the components, claudin-1 (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN), are key molecules for HCV entry and spread. 39, 40 On the other hand, TMPRSS2 cleaves newly synthesized HA in the secretory pathway within the influenza virus-infected cell 30 and also plays a role in the release of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. 41 To determine whether activation by TMPRSS2 occurs at the early stage of HCV entry and/or spread or at the late stage of HCV release, it is crucial to identify a protein cleaved and activated by TMPRSS2 during HCV infection.",

QSR and QTR are also sensitive sequences, shown by native proteins as targets. An active form of TMPRSS2 generated by autocleavage at QSR was produced in stably transfected cells in an enzyme-dependent manner (Supporting Fig. 6 ). TMPRSS2-activated, HAmediated fusion occurred using the H3 subtype of HA (Udorn/72), in which the cleavage site is QTR (Fig.  5D,E) . Thus, TMPRSS2 is broadly active on several cleavage-site sequences; QXR, QAR, and QGR are the most sensitive, but RVRR is clearly resistant (Figs. 5C and 6B). Recently, the substrate for TMPRSS2 was characterized using various HA subtypes; most of the 18 subtypes of HA examined were cleaved by TMPRSS2, but with varying efficiency. 42 Surveying the cleavage-site sequences, such as (Q/E)XR, in the surface proteins of lipoviroparticles and host entry factors in HCV infection identifies several possible proteins as candidate targets of TMPRSS2: E2; apolipoprotein (APO)B; APOE; lowdensity lipoprotein receptor; scavenger receptor class B, type I; CLDN1; and OCLN. The HCV fusion process depends on pH, the lipid composition of viral and target membranes, HCV E2, CD81, and CLDN1, though it remains unclear whether cellular proteases are required for this step. 40 To identify the target of TMPRSS2 will be helpful in highlighting a novel activation mechanism for HCV infection.",
