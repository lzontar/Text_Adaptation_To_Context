Direct effects occur as the result of physical factors but do not include pathogens per se. Miranda and others, 2002) Climate change has recently been recognized as causing a substantial change in the Lake Tanganyika ecosystem. The fish catch has decreased due to a climate-related reduction in the nutrient supply (O'Reilly and others 2003) . This reduction in ecosystem services places additional economic and nutritional stresses on an already poor and vulnerable human population. Although data to measure the health effect of this reduced catch are unlikely to be available, the effect is probably adverse because it causes reduced income and reduced nutrition (Verschuren 2003) . Another example is the collapse of cod fishing in the North Atlantic, which caused widespread unemployment, mental distress, and social dislocation, but little if any true under nutrition because the social mechanisms operating in Canada were able to partially substitute for the lost provisioning services once supplied by the fishery. A third example of a direct health effect from a reduced ecosystem service is the disruption and physical injury caused by flooding. There is increasing recognition that floods are caused by the interaction of climatic and landuse changes (Hellin and others, 1999; Zhang and others, 2000) .

Many infectious and some chronic diseases fall in this category. The epidemiology of many communicable diseases is related to ecological factors.

In turn, many of these cofactors are likely to have at least partial ecosystem change-dependent causation. Depending on the knowledge, bias, and experience of the observer, the causal role of ecological factors in state failure may sometimes be underestimated, or even totally denied. For example, Rotberg (2002) identifies the roots of state failure as based in ethnic, religious, linguistic, or other intercommunal enmity. He argues that state failure is ''man-made, not merely accidental nor-fundamentally-caused geographically, environmentally, or externally.'' We do not claim that reduced ecosystem services or other ecosystem changes that lead to adverse health effects are always a ''fundamental'' factor in state failure, but they are often important and usually identifiable. The enmity that Rotberg refers to often arises over the distribution of diminishing per capita ecosystem services. There may be increasing recognition of this. For example, O'Reilly and others (2003) concludes, in discussing the potential for further reduction in the ecosystem provisioning service of Lake Tanganyika, that ''the human implications of such subtle, but progressive, environmental changes are potentially dire in this densely populated region of the world, where large lakes are essential natural resources for regional economies.'' Ecosystem services as a significant element in state failure may be underrecognized due to our tendency to discount the future possibility of thresholds or emergence. Thresholds refer to sudden, nonlinear changes that result from a small increment and that are not intuitively predictable without prior experience (Alley and others 2003; Waldrop 1992; May 1999) . Emergence refers to the new property that becomes apparent beyond the threshold.

Another spectrum can be identified between a concerted attempt to protect existing ecosystem services (the ''value change'' scenario) and a laissez faire approach to ecosystems and the nonliving environment, such as climate change (the ''market forces'' scenario). A third spectrum is identifiable between trade deregulation (''reformed market'') and continuing or even increased protectionism (''higher fences'').

It also shows our estimation of the probability of changes in the ''health gap,'' that is, the gap between high-and low-income populations with respect to health. At present, for example, the burden of disease from diarrhea (of which nearly 90% can be attributed to unsafe water, poor sanitation, and hygiene) is over 100 times higher in the least developed countries than in developed ones. The health gaps between high-and low-income populations have been systematically estimated using a measure called ''disability adjusted life years'' which accounts for total years of life lost because of disease and also for partial years of life lost because of disability (World Health Report 2002) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 555, "end": 580, "text": "Cumming and others (2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1551, "text": "(World Health Report 2002)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 746, "end": 753, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "SCENARIOS AND HEALTH"}, {"text": "It is likely that in three of the four scenarios the health gap will decrease.

In this scenario, poor populations are increasingly ignored by the remaining population. Food security of the poor is likely to further diminish, perhaps leading to positive feedbacks as malnutrition impairs cognitive development and further hinders education and the chance of skillful social and political responses.

Table 3 provides an estimation of the chance of systems failure, depending on assumptions concerning the resilience of ecosystems and the linked socioeconomic system.

We suggest that it is meaningful to assume that human populations are characterized by social resilience, which modifies their capacity to effectively deal with stress (Carpenter and others 2001) . From a public health perspective, resilience may be defined as the capacity of society to respond to problems and challenges, over the short and long term, in ways that protect and advance public health, over the short and long term. Affluence, education, social cooperation, technological capability, and flexibility are important determinants of the size of social buffers and human resilience.

On the other hand, the chance of further modulated or even systems failure effects occurring is increased if ecosystem and social systems prove to be brittle. Because the size of ecosystem service buffers is falling and the extent of ecosystem service resilience is uncertain, it is prudent to reduce fur- ther ecosystem damage as rapidly as possible. However, it is also prudent to conduct this in a way that minimizes harm to human health. Continuing tradeoffs are likely to be required. For example, improving the health of populations in Indonesia may require further clearing of forests to generate more income. But this process cannot be continued indefinitely. On the other hand, excessively strict protection of the surviving ecosystems could reduce the size of the socioeconomic buffer, thus perhaps increasing the longterm risk of a modulated effect.
