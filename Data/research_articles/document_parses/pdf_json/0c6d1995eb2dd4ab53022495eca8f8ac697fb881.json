Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II genes of cynomolgus macaques are orthologous to human leukocyte antigen complex (HLA) class I and class II genes, respectively. Both encode cell-surface proteins involved in cell recognition and rejection of non-host tissues. MHC class I and class II genes are highly polymorphic, so comprehensive genotyping requires the development of complete databases of allelic variants. Our group used PacBio circular consensus sequencing of full-length cDNA amplicons to characterize MHC class I and class II transcript sequences for a cohort of 293 Indonesian cynomolgus macaques (ICM) in a large, pedigreed breeding colony. These studies allowed us to expand the existing database of Macaca fascicularis (Mafa) alleles by identifying an additional 141 MHC class I and 61 class II transcript sequences. In addition, we defined co-segregating combinations of allelic variants as regional haplotypes for 70 Mafa-A, 78 Mafa-B, and 45 Mafa-DRB gene clusters. Finally, we defined class I and class II transcripts that are associated with 100 extended MHC haplotypes in this breeding colony by combining our genotyping analyses with short tandem repeat (STR) patterns across the MHC region.

In support of these studies, the NIH has established several breeding colonies in order to provide Indian-origin rhesus macaques, Mauritian-origin cynomolgus macaques (MCM), and Indonesian-origin cynomolgus macaques (ICM) to NHP transplant researchers.

In order to describe the complex, high-resolution Mafa genotypes associated with each of the extended MHC haplotypes, we developed an abbreviated, regional haplotype nomenclature system for the Mafa-A, Mafa-B, and Mafa-DRB gene clusters that is similar to MHC allele nomenclature (Fig. 2) . Each of these regional haplotype designations begins with the species name (Mafa) and a \"diagnostic\" allele lineage for a major transcript that is expressed at high steady-state levels, e.g. A018. Regional haplotypes that differ in their combinations of major transcripts are distinguished by a \".\" delimiter followed by two digits in ascending order of their identification in various cynomolgus macaque populations. A final \".\" delimiter separates closely related haplotypes that share the same major transcript lineages but differ due to nonsynonymous and/or synonymous allelic variants.

Using this abbreviated haplotype system, the extended MHC haplotypes defined by the MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000061 STR pattern can be described by the following string: A018.01.05|B147.04.02|DRBW020.04.02|DQA26_01_01| DQB15_01_02|DPA02_13_02|DPB15_02.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 501, "end": 521, "text": "(Penedo et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 522, "end": 541, "text": "Larsen et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 490, "end": 498, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 562, "end": 568, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1166, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1833, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "Genotyping results for a representative group of four progeny from sire CX7K is presented in Fig. 3 to illustrate how PacBio sequencing data is used to define the Mafa transcripts that are associated with extended MHC haplotypes.

Since Mafa-DQ and Mafa-DP haplotypes each only include single genes for the alpha and beta chains, the individual alleles for these four loci are listed for each extended MHC The majority of the regional Mafa-A, Mafa-B, and Mafa-DRB haplotypes detected in this breeding colony are restricted to one or two extended MHC haplotypes (Supplemental Figures 4-6) . This observation is consistent with a previous study by Otting and colleagues that characterized 32 multilocus MHC haplotypes for pedigreed cynomolgus macaque breeding groups at the Biomedical Primate Research Center (BPRC) in the Netherlands (Otting et al. 2012) . Several Mafa-A and Mafa-B regional haplotypes are shared by multiple extended haplotypes however and do appear to be somewhat enriched in the Alpha Genesis breeding colony.

Only major Mafa-B reads are listed for illustrative purposes, but complete data including minor transcripts can be found in Supplemental Figure 8 . Each of these animals shares a common sire and inherited the paternal haplotype containing the MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000048 STR pattern (yellow). Each of the progeny expresses a series of class I and class II transcripts in common (yellow) that are represented by the number of identical PacBio sequences reads that were detected in each animal. These co-segregating transcripts are used to define the abbreviated regional haplotypes listed below the STR profiles. The remaining transcripts expressed by each animal are highlighted in a different color and inferred to segregate as the maternal haplotype inherited from their respective dams. Diagonally shaded boxes indicate that a transcript such as Mafa-B*030:04 is included on both the paternal and maternal extended MHC haplotypes. If PacBio read support is low, but a sequence is observed in related animals and/or MiSeq data, it is noted as inferred, e.g., Mafa-DPA1*17:01:02 for the extended haplotype defined by the shared MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000048 STR pattern B013.08.01 haplotypes are each associated with six extended MHC haplotypes (Supplemental Figures 4 and 5) . These extended MHC haplotypes do not appear to result from simple recombination events in the class I region that arose in recent ancestors of this breeding colony. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , the STR patterns flanking the Mafa-A004.01.02 haplotypes provide evidence of a conserved genomic region that is marked by three to six common telomeric and centromeric STR alleles in four extended MHC haplotypes, but each of these Mafa-A004.01.02 haplotype blocks is linked to distinct Mafa-B and class II haplotypes. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the first three STRs (222I18, MOG-CA and 151L13) reside approximately 0.3-0.6-Mb telomeric to the Mafa-A gene cluster and the next three STRs (162B17A, 162B17B, and 246K06) are localized a comparable distance from the centromere (Daza-Vamenta et al. 2004; Kean et al. 2012) where they flank the Mafa-E genes. Interestingly, the major Mafa-A1*004:03 transcript that is included as part of this Mafa-A004.01.02 haplotype was originally identified as the most common Mafa-A1 sequence identified in a cohort of ICM (Kita et al. 2009 ). In contrast, the STR patterns flanking the regional Mafa-A010.01.05 haplotypes are essentially completely distinct (Fig. 4) , suggesting that these six extended MHC haplotypes are truly ancient configurations. Unlike the extended cynomolgus macaque MHC haplotypes described here, the Indian-origin rhesus macaque population is characterized by a relatively limited number of Mamu-A, Mamu-B, and Mamu-DRB regional haplotype blocks that have been shuffled by recombination to generate extended MHC haplotype diversity (Doxiadis et al. 2013; Karl et al. 2013; Wiseman et al. 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 903, "end": 923, "text": "(Otting et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3458, "end": 3484, "text": "(Daza-Vamenta et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3485, "end": 3502, "text": "Kean et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3740, "end": 3757, "text": "(Kita et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4277, "end": 4299, "text": "(Doxiadis et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 4300, "end": 4317, "text": "Karl et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4318, "end": 4338, "text": "Wiseman et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 105, "end": 114, "text": "Figure 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 180, "end": 188, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 289, "end": 297, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 645, "end": 657, "text": "Figures 4-6)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1166, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1570, "text": "Figure 8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2673, "end": 2689, "text": "Figures 4 and 5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2875, "end": 2881, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 3220, "end": 3226, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3876, "end": 3884, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "Among the 293 macaques that were evaluated by deep sequencing in this study (Supplemental Figure 1) , there was only direct evidence for a single recombination event with the core MHC region.

This recombinant haplotype has a breakpoint in the class III region between the 9P06 marker of MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000001 and the D6S2883 marker for MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000005 (Fig. 1, Supplemental Figure 2 ). As expected based on the location of this breakpoint for MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000138, deep sequencing results demonstrated that it includes class I genes for the A018.01.03/B018.02.01 haplotypes from MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000001 together with the DRW33.01/DQA24g1/DQB18:08/DPA02g3/DPB15g3 class II genes from the MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000005 haplotype (Table 2, Supplemental Figures 8 and 9 ). This cohort included a total of 567 meioses that were informative for the detection of recombination within the core MHC region between the Mafa-F and Mafa-DPB genes. Therefore, this single recombination event yields an observed recombination rate per generation within the MHC of 0.2%. In a previous study, Aarnink and coworkers observed three MHC recombination events out of 282 informative meiosis (1.06%) in a captive breeding population of Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (Aarnink et al. 2014).

The extended MHC haplotype defined by the MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000005 STR pattern was exceptional in this regard since it was observed in 120 individuals, four of whom were homozygous. The abundance of the MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000005 haplotype reflects the fact that three of six founder males (CM94, CM9P, and CX7K) who initiated breeding in this colony between 2002 and 2005 each carried this haplotype. The available pedigree records only show that each of these founder males had different dams but their sires were unknown so they could be paternal half-siblings and at the very least must share a recent common ancestor. Together these three males sired a total of 122 progeny at Alpha Genesis for whom STR results are available and 59 of these offspring inherited the MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000005 haplotype.

The associated Mafa-B008.02.02 and Mafa-B008.02.01 regional haplotypes are distinguished by Mafa-B*008:02 and Mafa-B*195:01 versus Mafa-B*008:03 and Mafa-B*195:02 major transcripts, respectively (Supplemental Figure 5) . Fortunately, the rhesus macaque orthologue (Mamu-B*008:01) of these Mafa-B*008 sequences encodes one of the most thoroughly characterized MHC class I proteins in NHPs due to its strong association with exceptional control of simian immunodeficiency virus replication (Loffredo et al. 2007 ). Loffredo and coworkers have performed extensive epitope mapping studies and defined a detailed peptide-binding motif for the Mamu-B*008:01 protein (Loffredo et al. 2009 ). Since the predicted protein product of Mafa-B*008:02 only differs from its rhesus counterpart by a single V189M substitution in the alpha 2 domain that is not expected to be involved in peptide binding, it is expected to bind the same spectrum of peptides as those described for Mamu-B*008:01. The predicted Mafa-B*008:03 protein (associated with the MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000002 haplotype) is also closely related to Mamu-B*008:01 with a conservative substitution (D101N) at a key F pocket residue in the alpha 1 domain. This asparagine variant in the Mafa-B*008:03 protein is identical to the HLA*B27:03 protein that was also shown to bind a very similar array of peptides as Mamu-B*008:01 (Loffredo et al. 2009 ). The Mafa-B*008:03 protein also contains a second, nonconservative Y140S substitution at another key F pocket residue in the alpha 2 domain relative to Mamu-B*008:01; this residue is an aspartic acid in HLA-B*27:03 (Loffredo et al. 2009 ). Fortuitously, the second major class I protein (Mafa-A1*007:05) of the most common MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000005 haplotype also has a rhesus homolog (Mamu-A1*007:01) with a peptide-binding motif that has been determined experimentally (Reed et al. 2011) . In this case, the Mafa and Mamu protein variants differ at three residues in the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains, but two of three substitutions are highly conservative. Given the paucity of Mafa class I proteins with known peptide-binding motifs, animals that carry the two most common MHC haplotypes in this ICM colony offer a rare resource for studies that could benefit from the ability to monitor CD8 T cell responses. For example, it may be possible to use existing peptide-binding motif information to predict epitopes in a virus such as Ebola and then monitor CD8 T cell responses after vaccination and challenge (Sullivan et al. 2011) . Moreover, since Mamu-B*008:01 expression is strongly associated with spontaneous control of simian immunodeficiency virus (Loffredo et al. 2009 ), the high frequency of Mafa-B*008:01 in these ICM could argue against their use in studies where SIV control is an important endpoint.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 709, "end": 730, "text": "(Loffredo et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 881, "end": 902, "text": "(Loffredo et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1592, "end": 1613, "text": "(Loffredo et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1831, "end": 1852, "text": "(Loffredo et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2084, "end": 2102, "text": "(Reed et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2722, "end": 2744, "text": "(Sullivan et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2869, "end": 2890, "text": "(Loffredo et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 430, "end": 439, "text": "Figure 5)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "Comparison with MHC haplotypes in other cynomolgus macaque populations", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "As described above, the extended MHC haplotypes that we have characterized in this ICM breeding colony exhibit exceptional diversity.

The MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000131 haplotype described here (Table 2) represents a more distant ancestral relationship to the well-characterized M1 haplotype that accounts for nearly 20% of all MHC haplotypes in the MCM population . Although nearly all of the class I transcript sequences associated with this ICM haplotype were identical with the MCM M1 haplotype, several subtle allelic variants were noted. The MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000131 haplotype is characterized by a major Mafa-A1*063:03:02 transcript that differs from the Mafa-A1*063:01 MCM allele by three single nucleotide variants and a single G236E amino acid substitution. Likewise, a single synonymous variant distinguishes the Mafa-B*104:01:02 and Mafa-B*104:01:01 transcripts that are associated with these haplotypes. In contrast to the identical STR patterns noted between the MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000056 and MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000115 haplotypes versus those of Mauritian-origin individuals, STR allele sizes for the MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000131 haplotype differ from the M1 MCM haplotype at five of seven STR loci spanning the MHC class I region. In addition, the Mafa class II transcripts for each of these extended MHC haplotypes are completely unrelated. Characterization of MHC class I haplotypes of Filipino cynomolgus macaques by Shiina and coworkers (Shiina et al. 2015 ) revealed an even more distinct relative of MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000131 haplotype. The B-Hp2 haplotype which represents one of the most common Mafa-B allele combinations observed in of Filipino cynomolgus macaques also shares allelic variants of five Mafa-B lineages (Mafa-B*104:03, Mafa-B*144:03N, Mafa-B*057:04, Mafa-B*060:02, and Mafa-046:01:02) with the Mafa-B104.01.02 regional haplotype that comprises part of the extended MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000131 haplotype (Supplemental Figure 5 ) as well as the M1 MCM haplotype (Budde et al. 2010 ). This Filipino B-Hp2 haplotype is also distinguished, however, by at least four completely unrelated Mafa-B transcripts (Mafa-B*050:08, Mafa-B*072:01, Mafa-B*114:02, and Mafa-I*01:12:01) relative to its Indonesian and Mauritian counterparts (Shiina et al. 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 192, "end": 212, "text": "(Otting et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 213, "end": 231, "text": "Budde et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 232, "end": 252, "text": "O'Connor et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1575, "text": "(Shiina et al. 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2091, "end": 2109, "text": "(Budde et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2353, "end": 2373, "text": "(Shiina et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 184, "end": 191, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 308, "end": 317, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2056, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "Broadly speaking, MHC haplotypes that include members of the Mafa-B*028 and Mafa-B*021 allele lineages appear to be among the most broadly represented in cynomolgus macaques from different geographic origins as well as related macaque species.

This study was informed by an extensive database of STR patterns for a panel of markers that span the 5-Mb MHC genomic region that has been collected since this breeding colony was established in 2002. The STR data allowed us to define the allele content of extended MHC haplotypes for individuals that were known to share chromosomes that were identical by descent rather than simply inferring haplotypes based on combinations of class I and class II transcripts that appear to travel together in multiple animals who lack known pedigree relationships. A large majority of the 70 Mafa-A, 78 Mafa-B, and 45 Mafa-DRB haplotypes identified here were only associated with one or two of the 100 extended MHC haplotypes that we characterized. This extensive MHC diversity was derived from only approximately 79 founding animals for this breeding colony. In contrast, a comparable study of Indian-origin rhesus only identified 17 Mamu-A, 18 Mamu-B, and 22 Mamu-DRB haplotypes in the BPRC breeding colony that was established with 137 founding animals (Doxiadis et al. 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1461, "end": 1483, "text": "(Doxiadis et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding remarks"}, {"text": "Although this dataset is restricted to a single ICM breeding colony, it provides a glimpse of extraordinary MHC diversity that must be present in the wild population of ICM as a whole. It is reasonable to predict that the high level of genetic diversity described here for the MHC region will extend across the rest of the ICM genome. As previously noted, MCM are thought to be derived from a founder population of ICM (Lawler et al. 1995; Tosi and Coke 2007) which significantly limited the genomic diversity in MCM, especially in the MHC region where only seven ancestral haplotypes are observed. While this restricted genetic diversity is valuable in many areas of research, it can present a challenge for transplant investigators whose goal is to maximize MHC disparity between donor and recipient tissues. The ICM population, in contrast, exhibits considerably more diversity, increasing its value as a model species for biomedical research, such as transplantation studies. This pedigreed cynomolgus macaque cohort also provides a valuable resource for future studies designed to characterize additional immune-important genomic regions such as the killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (Bimber and Evans 2015; Prall et al. 2017; Bruijnesteijn et al. 2018) and Fc gamma receptors (Haj et al. 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 419, "end": 439, "text":

Likewise, the MHC-MAFA-NIAID1-000115 haplotype includes class I and class II transcripts that are all identical to the MCM M5 MHC haplotype. Comparison of the STR allele sizes for these two haplotypes with those of MCM carrying M3 or M5 haplotypes in a separate Alpha Genesis breeding colony revealed identical STR patterns (data not shown). These observations strongly suggest that these are Mauritian-origin MHC haplotypes that were inadvertently introduced to this breeding colony by founders with hybrid ancestry. A review of the pedigree records traced this pair of MCM MHC haplotypes back to two dams (CH2J and CV97) who were included among the original 2002 founders; the sires for both of these breeders are unknown. Similar observations were described for the cynomolgus macaque breeding colony at the BPRC whose founders were reported to have originated in the Indonesian islands and continental Malaysia(Otting et al. 2012). Three of the 32 extended MHC haplotypes characterized in this colony also included class I and class II transcripts that were identical to those that are associated with the M1, M3, or M4 MHC haplotypes of MCM", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "Acknowledgments We appreciate pedigree information provided by Isabelle Lussier for the Alpha Genesis ICM breeding colony.
