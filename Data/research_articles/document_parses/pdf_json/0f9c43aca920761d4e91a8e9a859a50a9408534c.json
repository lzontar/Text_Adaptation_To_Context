Early discovery of genotypic resistance allows timely adjustment of therapy strategies to avoid virologic rebound and hepatitis flare and to distinguish suboptimal responses caused by nonviral factors. Satisfying this clinical requirement needs a high-sensitive resistance-typing assay. Though direct sequencing is widely used to detect \u00d4new\u00d5 substitutions, and taken as a \u00d4gold standard\u00d5, it is considered as a relatively less-sensitive assay [22] . We developed a highsensitive nested PCR assay allowing us to analyse samples with quite low viral load as we did for the SARS coronavirus [32] [33] [34] . In this study, HBV DNA levels were quantitated in the Central Clinical Laboratory of the hospital, and we performed the direct PCR sequencing assay without knowing the viral load beforehand. Thus, the sequencing success rates in relation to serum HBV DNA levels are substantially objective. A small proportion of samples were positive (i.e., \u2021100 IU/mL) in HBV DNA quantitation by routine qPCR but negative in HBV gene amplification for direct sequencing. In fact, this is for the 28/393 samples in group B ( \u2021100 IU/mL but <2000 IU/mL) and the 5/313 samples in group C ( \u20212000 IU/mL but <20 000 IU/mL), although a lower detection limit of the latter assay was set at 20 IU/mL with a calibration standard. This may be attributed to differences between methodologies, e.g. the direct PCR sequencing assay needs to amplify much longer viral gene fragments than routine qPCR does and thus will be influenced more by virus disintegration.

Although line probe assays can detect minor sequences as low as 5% in the virus pool, an HBV DNA concentration no less than 10 4 IU/ mL is required [36] . In our one-tube PCR assay, all amplicons from the first-round PCR were subjected to the secondround PCR. The inhibitory effect of the first-round PCR products was eliminated by a special technique (Chinese patent application number: 200910092331.1), which contributed the most to the higher sensitivity of this assay. These advantages plus low cost permitted the use of the direct PCR sequencing assay for monitoring of drug resistance in the clinic. Hepatitis B virus RT sequences were available in nearly 40% of patients with undetectable HBV DNA by routine qPCR, implying that a very low viraemia may still exist in NA-treated patients with good virologic response. This offers a circumstantial explanation for frequent and rapid relapse of many NA responders when treatment is discontinued [37, 38] . The resistance mutations were detected in 48 patients with viral load less than 100 IU/mL, suggesting that low viral replication may reduce but not prevent drug resistance development. In clinical practice, HBV DNA quantitation is still more practicable than genotypic resistance testing to monitor drug resistance for patients with good virologic response considering cost-effectiveness. It was observed that patients with moderate levels of HBV DNA (2000-20 000 IU/mL) had higher resistance mutation incidence (41.9%) than those with higher viral load. One explanation could be that in the presence of the antiviral agent, suboptimal suppression of virus replication may provide greater replication advantage of the mutants against the wild type than poor suppression of virus replication does [39] . Other influence factors may include differences in treatment strategy and duration. Coexist-R L180M + A181V + S202G + M204V + N236T 1 ETV-R represents entecavir-resistant mutations, and Coexist-R represents coexistence of detectable LAM-R/ETV-R and ADV-R in viral populations.

More varied ADV-R patterns were detected in patients receiving LAM switching-to ADV than in those received add-on ADV. This is consistent with the findings by other groups [40] [41] [42] . Interestingly, LAM-R patterns were also detected frequently in the ADV add-on group. One possible reason is that ADV has relatively weaker potency to suppress LAM-resistant mutants whilst LAM has stronger potency to suppress ADV-resistant ones. The rtM204V was usually concomitant with rtL180M. Therefore, LAM switching-to LdT is unsuitable once YMDD mutations occurred, as LdT is ineffective against both rtM204I and rtL180M + M204V mutants, though it remains effective against the single rtM204V mutation [6] . Pre-existing ETV-R patterns were detected in some LAM-experienced and ETV-na\u00efve patients.

To date, reports on clinical MDR HBV strains are restricted to double resistance against LAM and ADV[23,[46][47][48][49][50], if rtA181T/V cross-resistance alone and anti-HBs immunoglobulin resistance are excluded. In this study, RT sequences with MDR mutational patterns were identified from eight patients receiving sequential NA. Interestingly, triple resistance against LAM, ADV and ETV was found which to our knowledge has not been reported previously. Dynamic analysis showed that MDR HBV strains developed in close relation to sequential drug administration and in accordance with clinical features. Coexistence of monodrugresistant mutants may favour the emergence of MDR strains. Although in vitro phenotyping was not performed in this study, it has been shown that MDR strains with signature mutations to both LAM and ADV (rtM204V + A181V/ N236T) have competent replicative capacity in the presence of LAM and ADV and obviously reduced susceptibility to", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
