In most cases, this indicator is utilized for specific epidemics of acute diseases such as cholera during which all patients are under treatment in a specific period of time and this makes it possible to calculate the death toll caused by a disease. The CFR indicates the fatality potential of a disease and it just includes the proportion of death toll to the number of patients. This indicator can be used for the following purposes: to describe fatality trend and its general changes; (1) to make decisions for health care priorities, resource allocation, planning intervention programs, and evaluation; and (2) to refine plans to improve public health; however, CFR can terrify a society in case of emerging epidemics when it is reported high (7, 8) . The exact value of CFR in the early stages of the epidemic is unknown and its precise estimation is impossible. At the beginning of epidemics, the number of actual cases exposed is largely underestimated (9) . Therefore, current estimates of CFR for COVID-19 should also be interpreted with caution as the disease is currently unknown. In Iran and in many other countries, some interpretations were made based on CFR during or in the middle of COVID-19 outbreak. These interpretations were sometimes published on social news networks and caused fear among people and put pressure on countries' health system. In Iran, given the fact that in this outbreak, CFR was high, there were different interpretations on the fatality rate of this disease, based on which different judgments were made concerning the health system.

According to studies, cases reported in official statistics at the begin-ning of the epidemics are likely to have a severe underestimation of the total of actual cases, so estimating the actual CFR for COVID-19 is currently impossible (9, 10).

To calculate the real amount of CFR indicator, it is necessary to identify all the cases infected by Covid-19 and the total death caused by it. However, currently, only the statistics belonging to those infected patients who refer to medical centers are recorded. The evidences indicate that more than 80% of people infected by COVID-19 show mild symptoms of the disease (5) and a fraction of this population may not refer to medical centers and, consequently, their data are not recorded. The findings of some studies reveal that the CFR of some emerging diseases such as Ebola decreases over time and this can be the result of creating and increasing the required facilities and infrastructures like laboratories and hospital beds and personnel's enhanced experience (12) . On the first days of diagnosis, given the identification of cases most of which led to death, much pressure were on Iran's Health System and different interpretations were put forward regarding this issue. During the outbreak of this epidemic, the main criticism Iran faced was the probability of its inability to identify this virus. One of the other interpretations was that this virus species may be different from the basic species and may be more fatal. These interpretations caused much fear among people and put a great deal of pressure on managers and experts of the Health System for decisionmaking.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1054, "end": 1058, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "4"}, {"text": "Therefore, making decisions just based on the CFR indicator during the outbreak of epidemics may not be the right choice and may result in overestimation and could threaten the mental health of a society.

In addition, CFR can be used to estimate the actual number of patients in such situations. Moreover, during the outbreak of epidemics, specifically emerging diseases, judgments should not be based on CFR. It is expected to identify the most emerging epidemics during their outbreak when they are severe and could lead to death.
