Finally, the genome terminal sequences were obtained using a modified 5 0 RACE technique as described in ''Materials and methods''.

Although rodents represent the most diverse mammals on earth, SeV remained the only known paramyxovirus of rodent origin until the recent characterization of MosPV, JPV and BeiPV by our group [7, 12, 13] . In this context, we decided to determine the genome structure and sequence of NarPV, another unknown rodent paramyxovirus. It is obvious that SeV and the rest of rodent viruses characterized to date do not share a common ancestor virus. In contrast, JPV and BeiPV are closely related both in genome organization and size and in gene sequences. In this paper, we have shown that NarPV and MosPV also share many genetic features, not only confirming their rodent origin, but also suggesting that these two viruses evolved from a common progenitor virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 432, "end": 435, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 436, "end": 439, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 479, "end": 482, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 871, "end": 874, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 875, "end": 878, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 879, "end": 882, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is worth noting that although JPV/BeiPV and NarPV/ MosPV represent two quite different groups of rodent paramyxoviruses in terms of genome size and organization, their common proteins do share more sequence identity than any other known paramyxoviruses, as shown by the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 5 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 294, "end": 300, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The only common feature we could identify among all known rodent paramyxoviruses was the lack of the multibasic cleavage site present in most other paramyxoviruses.

The taxonomic status of these viruses is yet to be determined.
