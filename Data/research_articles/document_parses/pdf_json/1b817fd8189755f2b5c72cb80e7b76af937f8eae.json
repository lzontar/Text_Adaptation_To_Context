Both humoral 3 and cellular immune responses have been shown to be important in host responses to SARS-CoV 4 (12). Antibody responses generated against the S and the N proteins have shown to protect from 5 SARS-CoV infection in mice and have been detected in SARS-CoV infected patients (13-16). 6 However, these antibody responses detected against the S protein were short-lived and 7 undetectable in patients six years post-recovery, suggesting that T cell responses may be 8 involved in the long-term control of this virus (17). Indeed, significant changes in the total 9 lymphocyte counts and T cell subset composition have been observed in patients with SARS- 10 CoV; namely, levels of both B cells, and CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have been significantly reduced 11 in these patients (18, 19) . Similarly, mice infected with SARS-CoV demonstrated that the severity 12 of SARS correlated with the ability to develop a virus-specific T cell response (20, 21) . 13 Both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses have been detected in SARS-CoV-infected patients 14 (12,22) as well as in SARS-CoV-2 (23). Notably, SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8 + T cells 15 persisted up to 11 years post-infection in patients who recovered from SARS (24). Studies in 16 mice have shown that SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8 + T cells provided protection against a 17 lethal SARS-CoV infection in aged mice (21) . In addition, adoptive transfer of effector CD4 + 18 and CD8 + T cells to immunodeficient or young mice expedited virus clearance and improved 19 clinical results (20). Immunization with SARS-CoV peptide-pulsed dendritic cells invigorated a 20 T cell response, increasing the number of virus-specific CD8 + T cells enhancing both virus 21 clearance and overall survival (25). These studies indicate an important role for T cell responses 22 in controlling disease severity, virus clearance and conferring protective immunity to SARS-CoV 23 5 infections. Given the homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as emerging 1 data on SARS-CoV-2 (23), cellular immune mechanisms might play a critical role in providing 2 protection against SARS-CoV-2. 3 Here, we used T cell epitope prediction tools from the bioinformatic pipeline RECON \u00ae (Real- 4 time Epitope Computation for ONcology) (26, 27) to identify SARS-CoV-2 epitopes recognized 5 by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. RECON was trained on high-quality mono-allelic major 6 histocompatibility complex (MHC) immunopeptidome data generated via mass spectrometry. 7 The use of mass spectrometry allows for the high throughput, and relatively unbiased, collection 8 of MHC binding data compared to traditional binding affinity assays, as well as the inclusion of 9 important chaperone molecules. Additionally, the use of engineered mono-allelic cell lines 10 avoids dependence on in-silico deconvolution techniques and allows for allele coverage to be 11 expanded in a targeted manner. 12 With this approach, we generated data for 74 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I and 83 HLA-II 13 alleles (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ). This mass spectrometry data enabled us to train neural 14 network-based binding predictors that outperform the leading affinity-based predictors for both 15 HLA-I (26) and HLA-II (27). Furthermore, we demonstrated in (27) that this improved binding 16 prediction leads to improved immunogenicity prediction by validating on a data set of tetramer 17 responses to a diverse collection of pathogens and allergens (28,29). Although RECON was 18 originally developed to prioritize neoantigens for immunotherapy applications, it is agnostic to 19 the source of peptide sequences evaluated and can be easily applied to peptides derived from 20 pathogens as well. As validation to that end, the binding predictors from RECON were used to 21 score Coronaviridae family peptides that had been assayed for T cell reactivity or MHC binding 22 from the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) database (30). The ViPR database integrates viral 23 6 pathogen data from internally curated data, researcher submissions and data from various 1 external sources. Our approach provides a significant improvement in both the breadth of 2 predictions, and their validity, compared with a recent study that had a similar aim (31). We used 3 the HLA-I and HLA-II binding predictors from RECON to predict the binding potential of 4 peptide sequences from across the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome for a broad set of HLA-I and 5 HLA-II alleles, covering the vast majority of USA, European, and Asian populations 6 (Supplementary Table 3 if a given peptide-allele pair was assayed multiple times by a specific assay type and was 18 determined to be positive in any single one of the assays, the peptide-allele pair was classified as 19 positive.

When applying the HLA-II binding 7 predictor, we used the highest score for all 12-20mers within a given assay peptide.

All twelve annotated open-reading frames (orf1a, orf1b, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, 15 ORF7b, ORF8, N, and ORF10) were considered as sources of potential epitopes. To identify candidate HLA-I epitopes, all possible 8-12mer peptide sequences from SARS-CoV- 19 2 were scored with RECON's HLA-I binding predictor. The HLA-I binding predictor was used 20 to score SARS-CoV-2 peptides binding against 74 alleles, including 21 HLA-A alleles, 35 HLA-21 B alleles, and 18 HLA-C alleles. Peptide-allele pairs were assigned a percent rank by comparing 1 their binding scores to those of 1,000,000 reference peptides for the same respective allele. Peptide-allele pairs that scored in the top 1% of the scores of these reference peptides were 3 considered strong potential binders. 4 These top-ranking peptides were then prioritized based on expected USA population coverage 5 (allele frequencies obtained from (32) -USA frequencies calculated as follows: The cumulative product itself represents the chance that an individual in the USA does not 14 express any one of the contained alleles; hence, the complement describes the probability that at 15 least one is present. The aim of using USA, European, and API allele frequencies is to cover a 16 diverse population where allele frequency estimates are relatively reliable. 17 We then construct two ranked lists of HLA-I epitopes by coverage. The first ranks the epitopes 18 by their absolute coverage, such that sequences predicted to bind similar collections of alleles 19 would be ranked similarly (Supplementary Table 4 ). The second list, referred to as the \"disjoint\" 20 list, is constructed in an iterative fashion where the sequence with the greatest coverage is 21 selected first, and then the coverage for the remaining epitopes is updated to nullify contributions 22 from any alleles that have already been selected (Supplementary Table 5 ). This second list was 1 used to generate Figure 3A . To identify HLA-II epitopes, we used RECON's HLA-II binding predictor to score all 12-20mer 4 sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome to predict both binding potential and the likely binding Table 2 ). 8 Peptide/allele pairs were assigned a percent rank by comparing their binding scores to those of 9 100,000 reference peptides.

Similar to the HLA-I T cell assays, there were too few recorded 5 HLA-II T cell assays (31) in our validation dataset to determine percent rank differences between We detected a total of 11,776 unique SARS-CoV-2 peptides that were predicted to bind at least 21 one HLA-I allele with a percent rank score of 1% or lower (Supplementary Table 4 ). 14 of these 22 peptides overlapped with a subsequence of the human proteome (see methods, Supplementary 1 Table 4 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 284, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 384, "end": 385, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 584, "end": 585, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 789, "end": 791, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1024, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1216, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1815, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1917, "end": 1918, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 826, "end": 833, "text": "Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF12"}, {"start": 1595, "end": 1605, "text": "Figure 1B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF23"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2194, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2311, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "22"}, {"text": "Unlike HLA-I, which has a closed binding groove that constrains bound peptide lengths to 3 approximately 8 to 12 amino acids, peptides binding HLA-II have a wider length distribution (up 4 to 30 amino acids or even longer) since the HLA-II binding groove is open at both ends. Peptides 5 bind with a 9 amino acid subsequence (termed the binding core) occupying the HLA-II binding 6 groove, with any flanking sequence overhanging the edges of the molecule. We consider a group 7 of peptides that differ in the flanking regions but share a common binding core as a single epitope. 8 Using the HLA-II predictor we identified 7,207 unique binding-cores that are predicted to bind at 9 least one HLA-II allele with a percent rank score of 1% or lower. The number of high-quality 10 peptide-MHC allele pairs we identify per SARS-CoV-2 gene is listed in Table 1 . The majority of 11 predicted peptide-MHC allele pairs are from orf1a and orf1ab, primarily driven by the length of 12 these ORFs. In addition, orf1a and orf1ab have very similar sequences, with over 18,000 identical 13 binding peptide-HLA-I allele pairs predicted for both ORFs. We therefore opted to exclude 14 redundant predictions and only reported unique pairs (see * in Table 1 ). Similarly, all HLA-II 15 predicted epitopes from orf1a were covered by those reported for orf1ab. 16 To test the validity of the SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptide-HLA pairs, we looked for identical 17 peptide sequences in the Coronaviridae portion of the ViPR database ( Figure 2D) . A total of 368 18 HLA-I peptide-MHC allele pairs from SARS-CoV-2 had both a percent rank lower than 1% by 19 our predictor and were found in the HLA-I MHC-binding validation dataset. Strikingly, of these 20 HLA-I peptide-MHC allele pairs, 328 (89.1%) had a positive assay result. As a comparison, we 21 also tested for overlap between epitopes predicted to have low likelihood of MHC-binding (percent 22 rank 50% or higher) and the validation dataset. 37 peptide-MHC allele pairs overlapped between 23 these sets, of which 36 (97.2%) had a negative assay result, as predicted. Further, we sought to 1 determine whether our highly predicted SARS-CoV-2 peptide-HLA-I allele pairs (percent rank 2 lower than 1%) would be validated by reported T cell assay results. Despite the significantly 3 smaller number of peptide-MHC allele pairs that were tested for T cell reactivity in the validation 4 dataset, 10 assayed pairs were also highly predicted by our HLA-I binding predictor. Nine out of 5 these 10 (90%) predicted pairs had a positive result to the T cell assay. No low-scoring pairs 6 (percent rank of 50% or above) were reported in the validation dataset. These findings demonstrate CoV-2 that had previously been assayed in ViPR were confirmed as non-binding. We therefore 1 concluded that using RECON's HLA binding predictors to predict T cell epitopes from the ORFs 2 of SARS-CoV-2 provides a significantly expanded, novel set of high-quality vaccine targets for 3 the virus.
