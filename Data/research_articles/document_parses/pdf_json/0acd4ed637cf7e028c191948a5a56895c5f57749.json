The formal process of assessing the likelihood and magnitude of risk, using that information to manage risk, and then communicating the process to others, forms the basis for risk analysis. Risk analysis pertaining to food safety is usually conducted by national, regional, and international agencies (FAO/WHO 2006 ) , with an ultimate goal of protecting human health by producing safer food and reducing cases of human illness (FAO/WHO 2006 ; FAO/WHO 2003 ; CAC 1999 ) . Risk analyses also help set priorities, as they can indicate where actions are most needed; which actions would be most effective at reducing risk; and where more research may be needed to fi ll knowledge gaps (FAO/WHO 2006 ) . Risk analysis has classically consisted of three fundamental components : risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication (FAO/WHO 2008 ; CAC 1999 ) . Knowledge generated from risk assessment is intended to drive the decisions made by risk managers and the information shared by risk communicators (CAC 1999 ) . After a brief introduction of the latter components, this chapter will focus predominantly on risk assessment.",

It can be simplifi ed to mean actions taken to mediate risks (Jaykus et al. 2006 ) . The most important component of risk management is that the decision-making process for risk managers should be transparent and be based directly upon scientifi c fi ndings of the risk assessment (CAC 1999 ; Wilde 2013 ) . Undertaking a risk assessment before making a risk management decision is an excellent way of achieving this goal, and hence the assessment itself should be linked to a very clear risk management question. Understandably, risk managers have to balance multiple factors, such as overarching economic capabilities, the available technology, and the current social, political, and legal status of the issue at hand (EPA 2000 ) . While risk management decisions are infl uenced by myriad factors, risk assessment is intended to be conducted based solely on science and hence independent of outside infl uences (Wilde 2013 ).",

As intimated above, risk assessment is only one factor that goes into decision-making to manage risk. The third component of risk analysis, risk communication, is the sharing of risk assessment and management information among stakeholders, the general public, and other interested or affected groups (Jaykus et al. 2006 ) , as well as among risk assessors, managers, and communicators themselves (EPA/USDA-FSIS 2012 ). The diversity of audience means that risk communication messages and methods must be carefully tailored to different audiences. The process may involve the creation of visual and written materials for distribution, but is more often two-way discussions with stakeholders, where the communicator appears as a credible source (Lundgren and McMakin 2013 ) . Risk communication for human enteric pathogens is typically a planned event performed by trained professionals (FAO/WHO 2006 ) . Aside from providing a clear explanation of the chosen risk management actions, this communication should also explain why the hazard poses a signifi cant health risk, what populations are most at risk, what assumptions were made in the risk assessment process, where uncertainties arose in the assessment or management process, and why some actions were chosen over others (EPA/USDA-FSIS 2012 ; FAO/WHO 2006 ) . document entitled: Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process (NAS 1983 ) , which has since been referred to as the \"Red Book\".

By the mid-1990s, there was increasing interest in applying probabilistic risk assessment principles to microbiological hazards, both in the environmental and food sectors. While the risk assessment paradigm is the same regardless of the nature of the health risk, the details differ. For example, chemicals remain stable, degrade, or perhaps change composition from the time of their deposition in the environment to human exposure, while microbes can multiply, remain stable, or even grow along the food chain. Cancer health risk modeling, which involves chronic low-level exposures, is very different from modeling the acute exposures associated with most human pathogens. Hence, in the mid-1990s, microbiological risk assessment diverged from chemical risk assessment and became its own discipline. In the last 20 years, many microbiological risk assessments have been undertaken in both environmental and food sectors.",

The principal aim of MRA is to provide an objective, transparent, evidence-based assessment of the health risk of multiple exposure pathways or scenarios.

The prime directive of a risk assessment is that it should be objective, unbiased, and based in sound science (FAO/WHO 2006 ; NRC 2009 ) . Ideally, in the case of foodborne pathogens, it should also take the entire food production process into account (FAO/WHO 2006 ) , such as growing, harvesting, processing, distributing, and other actions taken before the food reaches the end consumer, also referred to as a \"farmto-fork continuum.\" It is not uncommon, particularly in large-scale assessments, for formal risk assessment teams to be formed. The most effective risk assessment teams are multidisciplinary, combining the expertise of epidemiologists, biostatisticians, researchers, and other specialists (FAO/WHO 2006 ) . While risk assessments are typically portrayed as linear steps, the process should actually be seen as a series of continuous feedback loops, evolving as new information is made available. The term \"iterative\" is frequently used to describe this proc ess (Jaykus et al. 2006 ).",

An exposure assessment for food or waterborne pathogens is often an evaluation of the likelihood of the actual or anticipated intake of the pathogen in a population or certain subgroups (FAO/WHO 2003 ) . The likelihood of exposure is determined by a chain of events which, for a full risk assessment, usually encompasses all of the steps from production to consumption (CAC 1999 ) . Using enteric viruses in fresh produce as an example (Table  17 .1 ), this might include considering the possibility of contamination in production waters; irrigation practices; transmission of viruses during growing or harvest; washing conditions (if applicable); persistence of the hazard on or in the produce through the food chain; and food storage, preparation, and consumption practices. An exposure assessment benefi ts from quantitative information about the virus of concern including its concentration in the environment and on/in foods, how often environmental contamination occurs, persistence (or growth) of the virus in the environment or foods, and portion sizes and frequency of food consumption. The end product of the exposure assessment for quantitative risk assessment is a mathematical model expressing the likelihood and magnitude of exposure to the hazard across the farmto-fork continuum.",

The dose-response curve allows for estimation of the probability of specifi c health impacts (e.g., infection, symptomatic illness, hospitalization, death, chronic disease) based on given exposure levels (EPA/USDA-FSIS 2012 ). Under ideal circumstances, dose-response data are derived from human populations. Of course, availability of direct human challenge data is scant for diseases that cause severe illness (FAO/WHO 2008 ). Nonetheless, some human dose-response information is available for enteric viruses such as norovirus (Teunis et al. 2008 ) and rotavirus (Ward et al. 1986 ). In the case of hepatitis A virus, the dose-response relationship is usually extrapolated from a human challenge study with echovirus 12 (Thebault et al. 2012 ; Schiff et al. 1984 ) . Even with such human exposure information, only a few data points are available and hence modeling is quite crude. In the absence of human challenge data, information from epidemiology, animal feeding studies, and even laboratory-based studies on virulence or infectivity in mammalian cell culture can be used. In an ideal world, factors such as strain-to-strain differences in infectivity and population susceptibility are included in dose-response modeling, but frequently data with this level of granularity are not available.",

Named for a famous casino in Monaco, Monte Carlo relies on sampling random (or pseudorandom) numbers, generated like the outcomes from a roulette wheel (Zio 2013 ; Amar 2006 ) , and hence is probabilistic in nature. Basically, each input or variable in the exposure or risk model is estimated as a distribution, rather than a single \"point.\" The appropriate distribution is determined from the data source(s) or else by assumption. Then, for each risk calculation or \"simulation,\" the input values are chosen randomly from each distribution and a single risk number is produced. This process is repeated multiple times or as multiple \"iterations\" (usually 10,000) (Amar 2006 ) . Each of these is its own miniature risk assessment so to speak, and the results of all the iterations together are graphed as a distribution of probabilities and risk.",

Variability refers to data heterogeneity or variation; it is an inherent property of the data and cannot be reduced by further measurement (Suter 2006 ) . The term variability usually applies to a wellcharacterized dataset. Uncertainty is basically a \"lack of knowledge\" or absence of data (NRC 2009 ; Zio 2013 ) . While it can be reduced by further study or data collection, many input variables in a risk assessment are simply uncharacterized but still need to be included in the model. However, since their data are often assumed or at best approximated, they can lead to inaccuracy and bias in risk estimates. Remembering that simulated outcomes may not hold true in the real world, it is best to validate mathematical models with known disease incidence data or real-life information (FAO/WHO 2006 ) . Epidemiological data are frequently used to do such validations. However, this can be diffi cult for viruses as there are no international requirements to report foodborne viral disease outbreaks and the vast majority are unrecognized or uninvestigated (FAO/WHO 2008 ) .",

In sensitivity analysis, one input variable is toggled between its low and high value keeping all the others at median, followed by simulation. This is systematically done for each input such that there is a range of low and high risk associated with each input. Sensitivity analysis identifi es which variables provide the largest range of risk estimates, and the model is hence more \"sensitive\" to those inputs. In short, sensitivity analysis determines how changes in the entered parameters affect the results of a model (FAO/WHO 2006 ; CAC 1999 ; Zio 2013 ) , which can be used to identify inputs having the greatest impact on the magnitude of differences in risk estimates. This can allow the user to make inferences about realworld events. Frequently, the most sensitive variables are those that also drive the risk, and hence these are good candidates as the focus of mitigation strategies (Barker 2014 ) .",

The attendees compiled a list of foodborne viruses of primary concern on a global scale, based on criteria such as the health and economic costs of disease, incidence and prevalence, level of diffi culty in their control, and impacts on trade. The fi nal list included hepatitis A virus (HAV), human norovirus (NoV), and human rotavirus (HRV) (the three most important viruses), along with some emerging viruses of concern: hepatitis E virus (HEV), highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus (HPAI-H5N1), SARScoronavirus, and Nipah virus. The group also identifi ed virus-food commodity pairings of concern based on the current body of knowledge. The most important were NoV and HAV in bivalve shellfi sh (including oysters, clams, cockles, and mussels), fresh produce, and prepared foods. Lastly, the expert panel identifi ed three major routes of viral contamination of foods: human sewage and feces, infected food handlers, and animals (in the case of the zoonotic viruses) (FAO/WHO 2008 ). The working group concluded that a comprehensive QMRA of any one virus-commodity combination was not currently possible, given the lack of quantitative data required for such assessments (FAO/WHO 2008 ) . They did believe that lessons learned from similar consultations on bacterial agents, and the general concepts of risk assessment, were appropriate for evaluating viral foodborne disease risks if adequate supporting data were available (FAO/WHO 2008 ).",

Norovirus has a low infectious dose (perhaps \u2265 18 viral particles) (Teunis et al. 2008 ) . Millions to billions of virus particles may be shed per gram of stool, and for prolonged post-symptomatic periods (4-8 weeks) (Atmar et al. 2008 ) . People may also be asymptomatic carriers of the virus and viral shedding can begin before the onset of clinical signs (Atmar et al. 2008 . This suggests that a person may spread the virus to others before they even know they are infected.

This was a large-scale project, involving the compilation and evaluation of a comprehensive body of information, the creation of a database to store the information, and an outline of the parameters needed for qualitative and quantitative risk assessments. The team evaluated transmission via person-toperson contact, bivalve shellfi sh, salad vegetables, and fruit. The fi nal outcomes were suggestions for future research. In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) posted a risk profi le for HAV infection associated with the consumption of fresh and fresh-cut produce (FDA 2009 ) and continues efforts in developing a comprehensive hazard identifi cation on foodborne NoV; although at the time of this writing, no formal report or publication was available. The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority has documented evidence relevant to the transmission of HAV in shellfi sh, NoV in fresh fruits and vegetables, and HEV in pork , while the New Zealand Food Safety Authority sponsored a risk profi le on NoV in raw molluscan shellfi sh (ESR 2009 ).",

While discussing all of these is beyond the scope of this work, they have constituted active areas of research in the last 5-10 years. By way of example, initial studies on the prevalence of human NoV (and sometimes HAV) contamination in molluscan shellfi sh in the U.S. (DePaola et al. 2010 ) and fresh-cut produce in Canada (Mattison et al. 2010 ) have been supplemented by more recent contamination prevalence studies, also focused on molluscan shellfi sh (Brake et al. 2014 ; Loutreul et al. 2014 ; Rodriguez-Manzano et al. 2013 ; Suffredini et al. 2014 ; Schaeffer et al. 2013 ) and fresh produce (berries and lettuce) (Loutreul et al. 2014 ; P\u00e9rez-Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2014 ; Maunula et al. 2013 ; De Keuckelaere et al. 2014 ) .

Its use usually focuses on environmental persistence and resistance/inactivation by physical, chemical, or biological means. There are a number of instances in which predictive modeling has been applied to laboratory data on virus persistence and/or inactivation, for example feline calicivirus (FCV, a human NoV surrogate) and HAV with high hydrostatic pressure (Buckow et al. 2008 ; Kingsley et al. 2006 ) ; depuration kinetics of HAV and murine norovirus (MNV-1; another human NoV surrogate) in shellfi sh (Polo et al. 2015 ) ; heat inactivation of MNV-1, FCV, and HAV in deli meat by heat (Bozkurt et al. 2015 ) ; to name a few.

The authors then used these data to estimate a theoretical reduction in infection risk associated with this treatment. The experimental portion yielded D 10 values of 1.0-1.3 kGy for rotavirus and 2.3-2.4 kGy for poliovirus. The risk model included parameters associated with serving size, initial virus contaminant concentration (ranging from 10 0 to 10 3 PFU/g), output from the kinetic inactivation model, and dose-response (Beta-Poisson for rotavirus and an exponential model for poliovirus). Reductions in infection risks varied widely (from negligible to over 10 4 ) as a function of risk assessment parameters. By way of example, treatments of 3 kGy with a starting virus population on lettuce of 10 PFU/g reduced the risk of poliovirus infection from consumption of contaminated lettuce from a baseline of >20 infections to 6 infections per 100 individuals. Under similar circumstances, rotavirus risk associated with consumption of contaminated spinach dropped from >30 infections to 5 per 100 persons. This paper provides an example in which laboratory-based work was combined with a relatively simple risk model to produce estimates of risk reduction as a function of a virus inactivation strategy.",

Mean D 10 values of 4.05 and 4.83 kGy were calculated for MNV-1 and HAV, respectively. The risk model included the same parameters as used in the previous study but adjusted for the product (oysters) and the hazard (Beta-Poisson model used for both). The model predicted that if the product were contaminated at a concentration of 10 5 infectious units per 12 raw oyster serving size, a 5 kGy treatment would result in a 12-16 % reduction in infection for both viruses. At only 10 2 infectious units per serving, NoV infection risk reduction remained relatively stable (26 %) but a 91 % reduction in HAV infection risk was predicted. This study showed that even at high E-beam doses, the viruses of greatest public health signifi cance could not be eliminated from oysters, and at high E-beam doses, risk reduction was minimal.",

For example, human challenge studies f or poliovirus (vaccine strain) (Katz and Plotkin 1967 ; Katz and Price 1967 ; Minor et al. 1981 ; Lepow et al. 1962 ) , rotavirus (Ward et al. 1986 ) , and echovirus 12 (Schiff et al. 1983 ; Schiff et al. 1984 ) are available, as are relevant animal challenge data for HAV (in nonhuman primates) (Purcell et al. 2002 ) . Perhaps the fi rst signifi cant work, in which human challenge studies were used as the basis of doseresponse modeling, is that of Haas ( 1983 ) . This investigator compared three commonly used dose-response models with experimental data for poliovirus (three datasets) and echovirus 12 (one dataset). Specifi cally, the log-normal, simple exponential, and a Beta-distributed model were evaluated. The former two are deterministic models and the latter a stochastic model. For deterministic models, parameter values are determined at the outset and hence the model does not consider randomness or uncertainty. The output is hence \"determined.\" Stochastic models allow for randomness in one or more inputs and must be analyzed statistically. The outcome is not a single value, but a group of values.",

Atmar et al. ( 2014 ) estimated an ID 50 for Norwalk virus of 3.3 reverse transcription PCR units, which corresponded to between 1320 and 2800 genome equivalent copies, but the study did not include extensive mathematical modeling. The Teunis et al. ( 2008 ) work was the fi rst to analyze human challenge study data to produce doseresponse models for the prototype human NoV, the Norwalk virus. These investigators sought to determine the probability of infection in participants based on the hit theory, which considers microbial infection as a result of a chain of conditional events, i.e., (1) ingestion of one or more organisms based on an inoculum having a Poisson distribution; and (2) successful navigation of the organism(s) through all host barriers with maintenance of infectivity. A beta-distributed probability is used to model the latter. Particle aggregation was taken into account mathematically and was fi t to the experimental data. Probability of illness given infection was modeled by logit transformation of infection and aggregation distributions followed by production of maximum likelihood estimates. In susceptible individuals, the ID 50 was about 1000 and 18 genome copies for aggregated virus and disaggregated virus, respectively. The investigators concluded that that the average probability of infection for a single infectious particle could be as high as 0.5. Probability of illness given infection was also dose-dependent, and ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 for 10 3 and 10 8 genome copies, respectively (Fig. 17.1 ) . Thebault et al. ( 2013 ) used outbreak data to design a human NoV doseresponse model. Specifi cally, they used data from fi ve oyster-associated outbreaks in which the exposed population and attack rates were characterized; the number of oysters consumed was known; and the concentration of NoV determined from oysters associated with the outbreak. They used a Beta binomial distribution to model infectivity that took into account heterogeneity of the host-pathogen relationship and non-uniform distribution of the pathogen in the food. Bayesian modeling was then done to estimate model parameters and predict probabilities. Median ID 50 estimates were 1.6-7.1 genome copies per oyster. The median probability of infection for secretor-positive individuals (which are susceptible to NoV infection, unlike secretor-negative individuals) exposed to a single virus genome was around 0.29 (95 % CI 0.015-0.61) for GI human NoV and 0.4 (0.040-0.61) for GII. Illness probability was 0.13 (0.007-0.39) and 0.18 (0.017-0.42) for GI and GII, respectively. Statistically, there was no difference between infectivity of GI and GII human NoV. As expected, secretor-negative individuals had much lower probabilities of infection and illness. Overall, these data are in relative agreement with those of Teunis et al. ( 2008 ) , confi rming the exquisitely low infectious dose for this group of viruses.",

Such heterogeneity is mediated by a number of factors, including secretor status (innate, genetically predetermined immunity) and exposure-driven immunity. The ability of exposure to one human NoV strain to protect against infection with another, but only sometimes, also complicates modeling efforts. There are likely strain-to-strain differences in innate susceptibility and disease outcomes (disease severity) but these are also poorly characterized. In most instances, the inability to consider these factors in dose-response modeling means that current models tend to be more conservative (overestimate infection or disease risk) for normal, healthy individuals. This is probably not the case for sensitive subpopulations (young children and the elderly). Nonetheless, there are now solid human NoV dose-response estimates, which will likely be refi ned as data from GII.2 and GII.4 challenge studies are further analyzed.",

            "text": "6.1.1. Irrigation with Wastewater or Recycled Water Hamilton et al. ( 2006 ) developed a QMRA model for enteric viruses (as a group) in raw vegetables irrigated with non-disinfected, secondary-treated reclaimed water. The group chose this as a worst-case scenario: eating The variation in viral contamination (as a function of volume of water caught by the plants) was taken from previous studies using rotavirus for lettuce and cucumbers, and through fi eld trials conducted by the authors on water retention for broccoli and cabbage. The timing variable was based on reported data on natural viral decay coeffi cients. Exposure was tied to consumption of the produce items and a Beta-binomial dose-response model was used based on previous work, which was considered representative of enteric viruses in general. The results were compared to a standard EPA benchmark of 10 \u22124 , or one infection or fewer in every 10,000 people consuming treated water each year (EPA 1989 ) . Time since last irrigation was consistently signifi cant in affecting the calculated annual risks of human infection, with estimates of 10 \u22123 -10 \u22121 for contaminated irrigation ending a day before harvest, down 10 \u22129 -10 \u22123 for the irrigation ending two weeks before harvest (Hamilton et al. 2006 ) . Overall, the only cases that met the benchmark level of risk were those where the irrigation ceased two weeks before harvest. Based on sensitivity analyses, the most signifi cant area of uncertainty in the models was the amount of produce the individual consumed. The results led the authors to conclude that a withholding period for the use of wastewater for irrigation prior to harvest could be used for risk mitigation. Since this set of simulations represented the worst-case scenario, alternative irrigation methods and post-harvest washing and disinfecting would likely result in further risk reduction. Mara et al. ( 2007 ) ; Mara and Sleigh ( 2010 ) published two QMRA studies on risks to consumers following wastewater irrigation of crops, with an emphasis on simulating conditions in developing countries. In their fi rst study, they characterized rotavirus infection risk associated with consumption of wastewaterirrigated lettuce. Parameters included virus numbers using Esherichia coli concentration as a reference; environmental persistence of rotavirus; and human consumption. The Beta-Poisson model was used for estimating the rotavirus dose-response relationship and risk was expressed as infection per person per year (pppy). A tolerable risk of 10 \u22122 pppy based on modifi cation of the WHO drinking water recommendations was chosen for this study (WHO 2004 ) . Risks fell within a range of 10 \u22124 -10 \u22122 pppy when wastewater standards ranged from 10 3 to 10 5 CFU E. coli /100 ml, respectively. These results are consistent with the WHO standard of <10 3 fecal coliform/100 ml for unrestricted irrigation of salad crops and vegetables (WHO 1989 ) , which would theoretically correspond to a risk of about 10 \u22124 pppy. These fi ndings were also in relatively good agreement when compared to epidemiological data collected from an outbreak.",

            "text": "In their second study, Mara and Sleigh ( 2010 ) estimated the risk of NoV infection associated with consuming wastewater-irrigated lettuce using methods and parameters similar to the ones above, with minor modifi cations and some different assumptions. For instance, the dose-response model was based on the work of Teunis et al. ( 2008 ) and a 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 pppy was designated as the tolerable norovirus disease risk based on loss in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), adapted from WHO wastewater guidelines (WHO 2006 ) . Wastewater quality ranging from 10 6 to 10 8 CFU E. coli /100 ml resulted in median NoV infection risk of 1 pppy. A risk close to the tolerable level occurred at 10 1 -10 2 CFU E. coli /100 ml. The investigators concluded that, if wastewater treatment and post-treatment together resulted in a 5-6 log 10 reduction in E. coli , consistent with the 6-log 10 reduction in rotavirus provided by the WHO ( 2006 ), it should be possible to achieve adequate NoV inactivation. This assumed that a hurdle type approach was used, one that relied on moderate inactivation during wastewater treatment and a high degree of inactivation during post-treatment, e.g., natural die-off and produce washing and/or disinfection. Petterson et al. ( 2001 Petterson et al. ( , 2002 ) performed a \"screening-level\" risk assessment for the consumption of lettuce irrigated with secondary-treated sewage. They examined two primary factors: the quantity of human enteroviruses in irrigation water and the loss of viable virus particles on lettuce over time (up to 14 days post irrigation). They integrated data from the literature concerning enterovirus concentrations in secondary-treated effl uent; the rate of decay of enteric viruses on the crop and during storage; the amount of water (and hence virus) that attaches to the surface of lettuce; lettuce consumption rates; and dose-response information, extrapolated from known data on rotaviruses. The levels of enterovirus in effl uent were derived directly from treatment plant data. A bacteriophage provided the estimate for viral decay post-irrigation. Although initially the investigators reported risks higher than the EPA standard of 1 case per 10,000 people per year consuming fi nished (treated) water (EPA 1989 ) , in a later erratum, they noted a miscalculation in the bacteriophage inactivation parameters, making the actual rate of decay more rapid. This would mean that estimates of infection would have been reduced and actually fallen below the EPA benchmark of 1 in 10,000 cases, highlighting the importance of virus decay rates in calculating risk. Barker ( 2014 ) performed a very comprehensive QMRA to estimate NoV gastroenteritis risks associated with consuming vegetables irrigated with highly treated municipal wastewater in Melbourne, Australia. The study focused on vegetables that are typically eaten raw and irrigated with recycled water, specifi cally broccoli, cabbage, lettuce, and caulifl ower. The author used published information on the prevalence and amount of NoV in raw sewage (based on sampling or epidemiology) in Melbourne; surveys on produce washing in Melbourne households; and even analyzed their own samples of water. Other inputs included the duration of NoV shedding; viral decay after a holding period (0, 1 days); and a reduction in virus numbers following a potential wash-ing step, among others. A predictive model for effi cacy of wastewater treatment was developed and a Beta-Poisson dose-response model was used based on the work of Teunis et al. ( 2008 ) . Modeled scenarios included variations in water quality, time of year, type of vegetable, time from last irrigation, and qualities relating to consumers (i.e., washing practices, foods consumed, and body mass).",

Conceptually, the model was broken down into production (including irrigation water and harvesters' hand modules) and processing (including hands, rinse water, and cross-contamination by c onveyor belts modules). Virus inactivation was followed through each module, as appropriate. Three salad vegetable supply chains and two raspberry supply chains were modeled, each consisting of different combinations of inputs into each module. Due to lack of supporting data, the investigators did not consider certain contamination routes, including direct human fecal contamination in growing fi elds or use of contaminated pesticides. Contamination during food preparation in consumer kitchens was also not considered. Data for some model parameters, such as potential contamination points and viral contamination levels, came from the European VITAL project (Bouwknegt et al. 2015 ) . Information on food handling practices, effi cacy of virus transfer and removal in different settings, virus persistence over time, and others, were derived from the scientifi c literature.

            "text": "Fecal contamination of harvesting areas is the predominant route of enteric virus introduction in shellfi sh (FAO/WHO 2008 ) . Bivalve mollusks, such as oysters, are known to bioaccumulate human enteric viruses in their gastrointestinal tracts, allowing them to become contaminated when grown in areas impacted by human fecal matter (Maalouf et al. 2011 ) . In contrast, the chances of direct human contact with shellfi sh leading to contamination (e.g., from an infected individual shucking oysters) is considered to be relatively low (FAO/ WHO 2008 ). One major data availability issue is that shellfi sh production and monitoring has historically been regulated based on the fecal indicators of water, such as levels of fecal coliforms or E. coli (FDA 2011 ) . The presence or concentration of these fecal indicators does not correlate with viruses, and there are limited data on contamination prevalence in the absence of regular screening of shellfi sh and their waters for human enteric viruses. Pint\u00f3 et al. ( 2009 ) used a QMRA approach to estimate the levels of HAV in frozen, imported Peruvian coquina clams that were associated with actual outbreaks. Initially, they used molecular amplifi cation methods to estimate virus numbers in the implicated product from two outbreaks. These data were then used to estimate exposure risk by mathematical modeling that included variables related to methodology (i.e., adjustments for recovery effi ciency and infectivity); virus concentration reductions due to cooking; prevalence of con-tamination; and consumption. Choice of the best-fi t dose response model was done using a combination of the microbiological data, outbreak attack rates, and previously reported enteric virus models associated with human challenge studies. When a Beta-Poisson model was applied to echovirus 12 data, the researchers were able to estimate infection risks corresponding to consumption of lightly cooked clams on a per-batch basis, which matched the corresponding epidemiological data. A correlation between the prevalence of HAV cases and positive virus detection (44 % of samples positive) in clams associated with outbreaks was demonstrated, as juxtaposed to the absence of virus detection in clams randomly tested from the same batches as the outbreakassociated clams. This led the investigators to discuss the value of setting critical limits for potential viral contamination sources discharged into growing waters, and using targeted, direct, quantitative viral testing of shellfi sh to manage the situation when these critical limits are exceeded. Thebault et al. ( 2012 ) performed a QMRA for HAV in shellfi sh harvested from contaminated production areas. Their fi nal output was an overall annual risk of contracting symptomatic HAV among adult consumers of raw oysters in France. They generated two scenarios for mathematical modeling: one simulating a brief period of contamination (incidental) and the other for regular or prolonged contamination periods (endemic). Variables were similar to those described above for Pint\u00f3 et al. ( 2009 ) , including the use of a Beta-Poisson dose-response model corresponding to echovirus 12. Risk reduction was calculated as percent of baseline. Seasonal variation in oyster consumption was also considered.",

These were subdivided into several major strategies: one using E. coli as an indicator; another using HAV testing with or without confi rmation and at various frequencies; and the last being controlled purifi cation with or without virus testing. The mitigation strategies were further subdivided based on parameters such as sensitivity of detection, confi rmation of results, frequency of sampling, number of negative results before reopening for harvesting, and time to action. Direct HAV monitoring resulted in greater risk reduction than did the use of conventional bacterial indicators. In both contamination scenarios, twice monthly virus testing was an effective risk management strategy, avoiding about 40-50 % of the baseline cases. When contamination was accidental and homogeneous, waiting for three negative test results to reopen an area for harvesting was not effective in risk reduction. However, when contamination was endemic, waiting for the three negative test results was effective in preventing human cases. Any control measures that could reduce contamination by at least 2 log 10 units (e.g., improving sanitation, harvesting from lower risk areas) resulted in the greatest risk reduction (87-88 %). This exercise is a good example of how QMRA can be used to aid in evaluation of candidate risk mitigation approaches.",

RTE foods have also been associated with a number of high-profi le outbreaks (Friedman et al. 2005 ; Malek et al. 2009 ; Becker et al. 2000 ). An infected individual practicing poor personal hygiene and especially, engaging in bare hand contact while preparing food, is the most likely cause of this phenomenon. However, such individuals can also contaminate utensils, preparation surfaces, restroom surfaces, and play areas, etc. Since human NoV is released and likely aerosolized during projectile vomiting, this can also serve as a source of virus to contaminate foods (de Wit et al. 2007 ; Patterson et al. 1997 ).",

The model was conceptualized in accordance with the personal hygiene risk management triad that is based on the interrelationships among contaminant source, cross-contamination, and hygiene effi ciency and compliance. Using the restroom environment as a reservoir, the dynamics of NoV transmission were modeled between employees' hands, food contact surfaces, and food products. Key model inputs included degree of fecal shedding, hand hygiene behaviors, effi cacy of virus removal and/or inactivation, and transferability of virus between surfaces. The model was temporal in nature, beginning with an infected food handler failing to practice adequate personal hygiene, and following his/her movement through the restaurant environment, including food preparation, for an 8-hour shift.",

Not unexpectedly, the simulations showed the highest virus levels to be on hands, followed by surfaces and gloves, implicating hands as the most important mode of transmission. Gloving and handwashing compliance were found to be the most important practices for preventing contamination of foods when an infected worker was present on-site. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the mass of feces on hands, the concentration of NoV in the stool of ill individuals, the number of bathroom visits by the employee, the level of compliance with glove use, and handwashing effi ciency and compliance were the inputs having the greatest impact on risk. A novel aspect of this study was consideration of the joint effects of handwashing compliance and gloving compliance, or handwashing compliance and effi cacy. Using what-if scenario analysis, the authors demonstrated that combinations of compliance, gloving, and effi cacy are critical to keeping contamination levels at <10 infectious particles per serving. In short, one intervention alone would not result in elimination of signifi cant NoV contamination in the food if an infected food handler were present on the premises. Hence, control measures should take a multi-pronged approach. Stals et al. ( 2015 ) produced a quantitative exposure model to simulate transmission of NoV from the hands of infected workers to deli sandwiches at a sandwich bar. In their model simulations, three employees performed their duties using shared cutlery and a shared work surface during a three-hour shift. The model structure was quite similar to that of Mokhtari and Jaykus ( 2009 ) although it was designed to accommodate NoV-contaminated lettuce as an ingredient. Many of the variables were also similar to those of Mokhtari and Jaykus ( 2009 ) and their values came from the published literature. The group also performed a two-week observational study at two deli establishments to estimate number of contact events between hands, foods and surfaces during food preparation. Four possible interventions were considered: hand disinfection with an alcohol-based sanitizer; surface disinfection (with a cloth containing disinfectant or no disinfectant); no bare hand contact (glove use); and handwashing after restroom use.",

Of the individual intervention measures considered, hand-washing following restroom use was the only one that had a substantial impact on transmission of virus to hands, surfaces, and foods, and the degree of impact very much depended on compliance. For example, at low and intermediate degrees of compliance with handwashing, the fraction of deli sandwiches containing >18 virus particles was 91 and 65 %, respectively. If high handwashing compliance was followed, no sandwiches exceeded the ID 50 . Of course, using all four measures effectively reduced NoV concentrations on sandwiches to negligible levels (<7 virus particles) .",

In the only production/processing risk assessment of its kind, Bouwknegt et al. ( 2015 ) demonstrated that HAV and NoV risks associated with the consumption of berries and lettuce were minimal, and when elevated, hand contact was a much more signifi cant source of virus contamination than was irrigation water or the produce washing process. Models applied to molluscan shellfi sh (Thebault et al. 2012 ; Pint\u00f3 et al. 2009 ) focused on addressing questions associated with direct testing for virus contamination for harvest water classifi cation and managing disease risk.

A small body of risk assessment work on foodborne viruses has, however, emerged in the last decade. Initially constrained by a paucity of data to support values and distributions for key inputs, studies on prevalence, persistence/resistance, transferability, and other environmental features of these viruses have been recently published. New human challenge studies using GII.2 and GII.4 strains have been completed (although not yet reported), which should improve hazard characterization. Standardized test methods, improved ability to discriminate virus infectivity status using molecular methods, and better surrogates are moving the fi eld along as well. As national and international regulations begin to be promulgated, there will be an increasing incentive to perform QMRA as applied to viruses in foods.",

In addition, we now know that susceptibility to human NoV strains is, in part, genetically mediated but only a few dose-response models consider this fact. Hepatitis A and rotavirus vaccines are now widely used and likely provide life-long immunity, reducing the size of the susceptible population. Again, this is not usually con-sidered in hazard characterization. Estimates of infectivity can be created, but until a cultivable human NoV strain is found, they will remain estimates. There are many different foods, human populations, and production/processing/ preparation techniques, meaning that a \"one size fi ts all\" model is not really feasible. Consequently, risk assessments will be diverse and will continue to be subject to inclusion of poorly characterized or incomplete data, and assumptions. However, risk assessment remains a valuable means by which to integrate science in support of risk-based decision-making. In the absence of a crystal ball, is there anything better?",
