II) Analysing the growth rates and the types of mitigation across countriesOver the last few months different countries have performed different forms of mitigation to prevent the spread of COVID 19. These mitigations involved like the ban of large gatherings, closing of schools, banned flights, and other transportation, put cities in lockdown, etc. Such that, in order to see the effects of mitigation, this task was performed. The main objective of the task was to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation by trying to see if a correlation can be discovered between the different types of mitigation and the growth rate of active cases. Like what measures seem to work, which not and Which ones are the most effective, Keeping in mind that there are numerous factors which might affect the growth rate (e.g. country's general hygiene, population density, how much time they had to prepare for this epidemic before the spread was not much, etc.). In order to predict how the mitigation was affecting the number of active cases across different countries and regions, different regression models, were used to predict the number of active cases in a particular region. The goal of solving this task helps us to understand which mitigations are most effective.The advantage of doing this would be that, we will have an idea about how well the mitigations are working, and the actions that are taken till date, how effective are they, or how many cases have been prevented by this and so on.To prepare the dataset for this task firstly, dates were converted to day number taking 22 Jan 2020 as Day 1 and 24 April 2020 as Day 93. Then, total cases were extracted region wise in order of day number. To see growth rates, information for the number of active cases were needed. The active cases for every day were calculated by subtracting the total number of deaths and recoveries from the total case count day wise. After this the day number and active case count were scaled to observe clearer results. For different affected countries, a linear regression and a polynomial regression model was fitted and visualized to the dataset to predict the number of active cases in that particular region. In the polynomial regression model, the model was fitted with different polynomial degrees to find which degree curve fits best. Then, in an urge to",
