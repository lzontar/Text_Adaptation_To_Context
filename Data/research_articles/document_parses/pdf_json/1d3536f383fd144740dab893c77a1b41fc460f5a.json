For instance, after imposition of the mitigation measures like social distancing, home quarantine in China has largely controls the COVID-19 disease spread and growth rates become negative in most locations (Kraemer et al., 2020) . With R0 (=2.5) in China, many experts believed that from 20 to 60% of global population could infected (Hellewell et al., 2020) . To reduce R0, WHO had urged countries to practice infection prevention and control (IPC) to slow down the viral spread in community. To support this, a modeling developed by (Lee et al., 2012) mentioned contact monitoring or self quarantine could do possible decay of R0, eventually reduce the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition, government measures including immediate quarantine of potentially infected patients, household isolation, and eventual lockdown among high hitting cities (as did in Italy) could mitigate this epidemic. In this study, we estimate virus reproduction numbers by fitting exponential infection growth rates across both daily and weekly basis, also forecasting done by using day to day assessment though single observations.",

Serial interval (SI) is the duration between the onset symptom of initial case and onset symptom of the second case in the transmission chain. In the early virus epidemic at Wuhan center, the mean SI of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), and Rt was estimated to 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) in (Li et al., 2020) . In Italy, Rt is estimated ranging from 2.76 to 3.25 and SI estimated 6.6 (95% CI, 0.7-19) which results from the third-highest number of infected cases and death toll after the USA, and Spain (Liu et al., 2020; Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020) . Studies among the Marche, we employed the 'incidence' and 'projections' package of R statistics. This particular package implements a simple, probability-based prediction of Rt with the help of branching process couples with Poisson likelihood. The adopted model requires knowledge of serial interval distribution over symptom onset dates. Transmissibility is defined by weighting R0 with the likelihood of SI mass function of a corresponding day (Cori et al., 2013) . Usually when R0 >1, the infection might spread over the population to a large extent, and more efforts are needed to control the pandemic. Rt is the average of secondary cases infected from the single infected individual if conditions remain the same as at time t (Fraser, 2007) . For Rt estimation, assumption of mean and serial interval (i.e., the delay between primary and secondary symptom onset dates) parameters was done. Since in the absence of sufficient information on cluster outbreak for SI estimation, we assumed SI of Marche region was equal to that of the COVID-19 Lombardy region with a mean of 6.6 days and a standard deviation of 3.1 days (Riccio, 2020) . We evaluated individual Rt values for over five individual provinces with maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation. The function get_R was used to estimate the most likelihood of Rt values. To derive the other statistics, we used sample_R with a bootstrap strategy of 1000 times resampling to get a large sample of likely Rt values.",

We simulated future incidences using a branching process model that respects the renewal equation of (Fraser, 2007) , assumes that Poisson offspring distribution was used for inference. For its simplicity, we implemented a simple linear regression method that can be used to fit the exponential growth of infected incidences over time and applied linear regression over the incidence data. Within the sight of both developing and diminishing periods of a pandemic, the date represents the epidemic peak can be assessed. We implemented function estimate peak () utilizes multinomial bootstrapping to assess the peak, to evaluate reporting over time, the total number of known cases, and bootstrap never samples zero-frequency days. This function restores the estimated peak of confidence interval (CI) along with the bootstrap forecasts. We built the incidence objects by loading the incidence function, on the date of onset variable with the argument of the default interval because we considered the daily incidence. We the applied the R projection package for epidemic trajectories simulation and to predict daily and cumulative incidence. The prediction model was done by considering existing of daily incidence data, estimated reproductive number, and serial interval distribution using a discrete package. We performed the prediction of daily as well as cumulative incidence for the next 30 days (from April 20 to May 20, 2020) by using bootstrap resampling (1000 times). Besides, we presented both daily, and cumulative incidences range by graph for the next 30",

Because of its simple nature towards infectious disease dynamics covers the difficulty of this metric.

It is evident from the study, the outbreak size and daily incidence largely depend on the daily reproductive number. However, we perform projections with Rt remains unchanged, the daily incidences can be varied with the distinct percentile of inhabitants. The projections concluded that at the end of the 30 th day the cumulative incidences 323 (95% CI), and daily incidences 45 (95% CI) might be reached. These values might be gradually reduced if local governance stops transmissibility of the virus by putting continuous efforts on contact tracing, and identifying symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. This analysis highlights the importance of controlling transmissibility among Marche inhabitants. Our study has some limitations. Primarily, because of the non-availability of information on the cluster outbreak, we adopted the values of SI, and the standard deviation in Rt estimation from the study on Lombardy, which might hamper the importance of this analysis. Second, general patients are forcing in confined to home, could affects the natural process of disease transmission.

In this study, we focused on calculating the daily reproduction number Rt in Marche (Italy) region and established a predictive model for the next thirty days. The Marche region is the 8 th in terms of number of people infected in Italy and the first in terms of diffusion of the infection among the 4 regions of the center of Italy. Understanding the dynamics of early transmission and assessment ineffectiveness of mitigation measures is important to evaluate the potential of sustained transmission occurred among other cities of the Marche region. Individual Rt values of all five provinces in Marche were computed and compared. This study highlights the knowledge discovery of the COVID-19 outbreak, especially in disease transmission, and the necessity of mitigation measures to control. is a part of the central Italy, and is enclosed with five individual provinces of Ancona, Ascoli Piceno, Fermo, Macerata, and Pesaro, and Urbino.
