Using classifications based on clinical-demographic features (regardless of disease severity, age, gender, or pathogen types) with principal component analysis revealed no clear patterns of separation for distinguishing lipid profiles that correlated with any of the clinical features. However, cluster analysis identified three distinct lipid clusters; subjects in different clusters exhibited significant differences in disease severity, the incidence of hypoxemia, the percentages of PMNs and macrophages in BALF, and the serum concentrations of albumin and total cholesterol. We also identified individual lipids at the molecular level (SM d34:1 and PE 18:1p/20:4) that significantly correlated with the phagocytes (PMNs and macrophages) in BALF.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our findings thus suggest that the specific lipid composition in the lower airway may relate to the intensity of the host inflammatory response, rather than clinical and demographic differences, and may contribute to functionally relevant shifts in CAP disease pathogenesis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Based on their appearance in consistent ratios across severely inflamed cases of CAP, SM d34:1 and PE 18:1p/ 20:4 may serve as reliable diagnostic markers for increased infiltration by macrophage and PMNs, respectively, which accompany local points of tissue inflammation, and thus may serve as potentially useful starting points for development of targeted therapeutics for CAP infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our data showed that patients in different lipid clusters exhibited significantly different degrees of PMNs infiltrations. PMNs and macrophages are major phagocytes that play crucial roles in inflammation, the first line of defense against invaders. Activated tissue macrophages will drive inflammation by recruiting neutrophils and other leukocytes [23] . However, excessive infiltration by PMNs can also result in tissue damage. Furthermore, increases in tissue PMNs can be used as indicators of the degree of local inflammation. The high-(LClus1) and the medium-(LClus2) inflammatory response groups had inversely correlated lipid profiles in comparison to the low response group (LClus3). LClus1, high in PMNs, was characterized by abundant phospholipids (mostly PC and PE species), likely indicating damaged tissue from excessive and destructive lung inflammation, given that phospholipids are major components of all cell membranes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 350, "end": 354, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "However, it remains unclear if the prevalent lipids in LCLus1 and LCLus2 are responsible for the elevated inflammation, or if; conversely, the PC and PE phospholipids are produced by inflammation-induced tissue damage. Tisoncik et al. [24] reported significant abundant phospholipids (PC and PE species) in bronchial epithelial cells of ferrets in response to influenza virus infection. They speculate that the lipid mediators derived from phospholipid arachidonic acid (FA 20:4) reservoirs may contribute to tissue damage during pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infection. Our finding that PE 18:1p/20:4 is positively correlated with PMN percentages in BALF may support their hypothesis. The 20:4 side-chain in PE 18:1p/ 20:4 can be cleaved to form arachidonic acid, the precursor to eicosanoids converted by the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. Increased production of arachidonic acid-derived pro-inflammatory prostaglandin and leukotriene levels [25] can induce PMN infiltration [26, 27] , enhance inflammatory responses, and finally lead to tissue damage. In addition, although sphingolipid signal transduction pathways have been known to play an important role in the regulation of growth and survival pathways in macrophages [28] , the exact role of SM (d34:1) still requires future research.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 235, "end": 239, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 947, "end": 951, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 980, "end": 984, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 985, "end": 988, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1233, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our data shows that fatty acids are notably involved in CAP.

In addition, specialized pro-resolving lipid (SPM) mediators (the resolvins and the protectins/neuroprotectins) derived from n-3 PUFA [35] reveal their role as anti-and pro-resolving inflammation as well as enhancing microbial clearance [8] . Unexpectedly, our data suggested the opposite tendencies of pro-and anti-inflammatory lipid alternations in either CAP patients or patients in LClus1. Recently Sun and colleagues report that same pattern of accumulation of serum palmitic acid (FA 16:0) during H7N9 pneumonia. The levels of palmitic acid decreased while the clinical conditions became more severe, and increased as the disease was ameliorated [36] . Schmidt et al. also found that PUFA increased approximately 3-fold in BALF of adult respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) patients [37] . In light of our own data, which agrees with the findings of Schmidt and Sun, we are compelled to reconsider the pro-and anti-inflammatory designations assigned to bioactive lipids, since their proposed activity is not supported by our HPLC-MS data in CAP patients. We speculate that the role of bioactive lipids, such as PUFAs in mitigating inflammation, is context dependent and may be influenced by other factors that fall outside the scope of this study. TG and SM classes, the top 2 and the top 3 lipid sub-classes of the total BALF lipidome, respectively, show no difference between CAP and controls, and no difference between the LClus1 high-inflammatory response group and the LClus3 low-inflammatory response group. Previous studies have reported hypertriglyceridemia during infection, and different types of infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) result in similar effects on triglyceride metabolism [38] [39] [40] [41] . Infection-associated hypertriglyceridemia is induced via increased hepatic lipoprotein production and/or decreased lipoprotein catabolism [42] . However, some clinical studies came to the opposite conclusion, partially supporting our observations, in that lower or no significantly changes in triglyceride levels were observed in critically ill and severely infected patients [43, 44] .
