            "text": "Purpose Chlamydia psittaci infection in humans can lead to serious clinical manifestations, including severe pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and, rarely, death. Implementation of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) gives a promising new tool for diagnosis. The clinical spectrum of severe psittacosis pneumonia is described to provide physicians with a better understanding and to highlight the rarity and severity of severe psittacosis pneumonia. Methods Nine cases of severe psittacosis pneumonia were diagnosed using mNGS. Retrospective analysis of the data on disease progression, new diagnosis tool, treatments, and outcomes, and the findings were summarised. Results Frequent symptoms included chills and remittent fever (100%), cough and hypodynamia (100%), and headache and myalgia (77.8%). All patients were severe psittacosis pneumonia developed respiratory failure, accompanied by sepsis in 6/9 patients. mNGS takes 48-72 h to provide the results, and help to identify diagnosis of psittacosis. Laboratory data showed normal or slightly increased leucocytes, neutrophils, and procalcitonin but high C-reactive protein levels. Computed tomography revealed air-space consolidation and ground-glass opacity, which began in the upper lobe of one lung, and spread to both lungs, along with miliary, nodular, or consolidated shadows. One patient died because of secondary infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the other eight patients experienced complete recoveries. Conclusions The use of mNGS can improve accuracy and reduce the delay in diagnosis of psittacosis. Severe psittacosis pneumonia responds well to the timely use of appropriate antibiotics.",

Chlamydia psittaci is responsible for less than 5% of community-acquired pneumonia [3, 4] . Several outbreaks of C. psittaci infections in humans have occurred in different countries over the past 20 years, with a case fatality rate of less than 1% [5, 6] . Chlamydia psittaci enters the body mainly through the respiratory tract by inhaling aerosolised bacteria when exposed to infected secretions, droppings, or feathers [6] . Chlamydia psittaci occurs not only in Psittacinae and pigeons but also in poultry. Poultry, including chickens and ducks, are the most important sources of infection in China. One study found that the prevalence of C. psittaci in poultry sold in markets was 13% in chickens, 39% in ducks, and 31% in pigeons [7] .",

A total of 100 ng of the extracted DNA were subjected to processes of interruption, end repair, library construction, and sequencing. Agilent 2100 was used for quality control. Sequencing were performed at BGISEQ-100 platform (Beijing Genomics Institute, Wuhan, China). 3. The remaining nonhuman sequences were read after subtraction of the human host sequences mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment and the low-quality reads and short reads (length < 35 bp) were removed. The remaining data were aligned to the four Microbial Genome Databases, consisting of bacteria, virus, fungi, and parasites. The mapped data were processed for advanced data analysis. Lists of suspected pathogenic microorganisms were produced, which included the numbers of strictly mapped reads, coverage rate, and depth. The clinical diagnosis was determined by considering all the clinical manifestations, possible pathogens identified by mNGS and other laboratory tests together.",

After admission to our hospital, patients underwent bronchofibroscopy, and alveolar lavage fluid was collected for mNGS. Six of the patients developed septic shock, and their blood and alveolar lavage fluid samples were sent for mNGS simultaneously (Fig. 3) . The typical bronchofibroscopy findings were hyperaemic tracheal mucosa with oedema, a moderate amount of thin white or yellow secretions in the segmental bronchi, and occasional small patches of scattered haemorrhage. Patients were started on empirical antibiotic therapy with \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combinations and quinolones on ICU admission according to the community-acquired pneumonia management guideline [14] . The mNGS took 48-72 h from the receipt of the sample to the reporting of the results. When C. psittaci infection was confirmed, the antibiotic was changed to minocycline [2] . Patients with sepsis and protracted clinical courses were also treated with supplementary carbapenems, linezolid, or tigecycline. Minocycline was administered for at least 2 weeks, according to recommendations [2] .",

Our nine cases of severe psittacosis pneumonia, diagnosed with the aid of mNGS, and had characteristics and clinical features that differed from previously reported cases [7, 9] . Previous reports on psittacosis have included chills, white phlegm, cough, generalised myalgia, and weakness as general symptoms, and most reported cases have been of mild-to-middle severity [1, 2] . In our nine cases, headache was a prominent feature in seven patients, and five patients had lethargy or a coma, with one patient being suspected to have meningitis initially. Respiratory failure and septic shock developed gradually and necessitated the provision of mechanical ventilation and organ support therapy, which has not been reported previously. The patients' laboratory data generally showed normal or slightly elevated leucocytes, neutrophils, and PCT, with high CRP levels. Knittler and Sachs [15] reported that C. psittaci is more pathogenic and multiplies more rapidly than other Chlamydiales species, and therefore, C. psittaci causes more severe inflammatory reactions. Inflammatory lesions in CT began in the upper lobe of lung, aggravated to bilateral lobes and air-space consolidation and ground-glass opacity, along with miliary, nodular, or consolidated shadows. Additionally, patients with septic shock and those who require mechanical ventilation are susceptible to secondary infections, which can lead to death, as illustrated by the patient in our study who died because of Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia.",
