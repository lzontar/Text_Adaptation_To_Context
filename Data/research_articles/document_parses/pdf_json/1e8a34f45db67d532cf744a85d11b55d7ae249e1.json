However, the small number of observed events does not enable us to explore the additive value of RVLS over the known risk factors. Future studies with larger simple sizes are needed to determine the additional prognostic value of RVLS over the other clinical and echocardiographic parameters in COVID-19 patients. Reply to right ventricular longitudinal strain: a new prognostic tool for COVID-19? We are delighted to respond to Dr. Schiavon and colleagues, commenting on the relatively high prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and no case of pulmonary embolization (PE) in our study. Each patient in the present study received both bedside echocardiography and the lower extremity venous ultrasound. The levels of DVT included the bilateral common femoral, deep, and superficial femoral, and the popliteal veins as well as the posterior tibial, peroneal, and calf muscle veins. Moreover, if there was any clinical suspicion of PE, computed tomographic angiography of the pulmonary arteries (CTPA) was considered (4), and obtained, if possible. In the present study, CTPA was performed in 2 patients with DVT, but neither of them was diagnosed with PE. Although previous studies demonstrated an increased risk of DVT and potential PE in respiratory and other intensive care settings",
