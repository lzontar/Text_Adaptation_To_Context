            "text": "The most widespread airborne diseases as common colds or influenza are caused by air pathogenic bacteria and viruses. In recent years, the world has been spectator of new more severe respiratory diseases from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) to the most recent and current pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Implemented protocols and rules, suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO), together with the scientific community of specialists, followed by almost all world governments, help to ease the pandemic. However, individual protection measures do not completely mitigate the risk of contagion for healthcare staff and patients and the remaining population. In fact, personal protection equipment is currently available without an intrinsic antimicrobial/virucidal action with only temporary protection for users. In general, all the air filtering media are subjected to microbial/viral colonization. They limit the microorganism circulation in the air, but they do not inactivate them or avoid their proliferation on the filtering media [1] . Considering also that our generation is called \"indoor generation\" because people spend about 90% of time indoor, the airborne disease widespread becomes a very critical issue [2] . This aspect become fundamental especially for all indoor and crowded places, from hospitals to public transport, universities and schools, entertainment and culture places, offices, markets, sports centres. For this purpose, an efficient approach for further increasing the people protection from contaminated air filtering media is essential in order to reinforce our health infrastructure and to better prepare and protect the health of workers, caregivers, patients and people in general. Several studies already demonstrated the antibacterial and antifungal behaviour of silver ions and nanoparticles, thanks to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity [ Recently, several researches verified in vitro the antiviral effect of silver nanoparticles [13], as example against H1N1 influenza A virus [14] . In this study, a preliminary evaluation of the antiviral effect towards Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 of this silver nanocluster/silica composite coating deposited on a facial FFP3 mask was evaluated.",

As already reported, this coating can be deposited on practically every kind of filtering media and also on metallic, ceramic, polymeric and glasses surfaces. It can hence provide an effective contribution to safety of crowded areas like supermarkets, productions sites, schools, hospitals, etc, where surfaces are exposed to many contacts with body parts each day. It can increase the working life of filtering masks and filtering media, also reducing the waste production related to their disposal. ",

Scanning electron microscopy (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope FESEM, QUANTA INSPECT 200, Zeiss SUPRATM 40\u2122) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS, EDAX PV 9900\u2122) was used to observe the morphology and to detect the composition (three areas at 170x of magnification) of the coating on mask fibres. Two types of experiments were used to evaluate the antiviral activity of the coating, deposited on the facial mask, against the SARS-CoV-2. In a first experiment 100 \u00b5l of 50 TCID 50 /ml SARS-CoV-2 viral strain, isolated from a symptomatic patient and previously titrated, was added to each of five pieces (1 cm 2 ), cut from the coated (only Ag3W) and uncoated facial mask, and incubated in a Petri dish at room temperature. Both the coated and uncoated samples were sterilized in vapour autoclave at 120 \u00b0C for 20 minutes in order to avoid any contamination from other microorganisms during the test. The second experiment was conducted in a similar way, but keeping the Petri dish open under a laminar flow of a safety cabinet and with samples not sterilized (both Ag3W and Ag5W), in order to better simulate the real working condition of facial mask. After 1 hour 30 minutes,100 \u00b5l of medium in the first experiment and 200 \u00b5l of medium in the second experiment were added to each mask pieces to collect the inoculum. 50 \u00b5l of the collected inoculum with a serial twofold dilution sequence, were added in six wells of a flat bottom tissue culture microtiter plate (COSTAR, Corning Incorporated, NY 14831, USA), mixed with 50 \u00b5l of 10 4 Vero cells [VERO C1008 (Vero 76, clone E6, Vero E6); ATCC\u00ae CRL-1586\u2122] and incubated at 33 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 for 72 hours. The infectivity of virus was determined by observing the formation of cytopathic effect (CPE) and the staining of viable cells by Gram's crystal violet solution (Merck KGaA) plus 5% formaldehyde 40% m/v (Carlo Erba SpA) for 30 minutes. Microtiter plate was washed in running water. A blue staining of the cells indicated the absence of the viable virus, while infected cells were washed away after the staining. The titre was the maximum dilution with a cytopathic effect. A positive control virus was included in the tests. Five samples for each types of mask were analysed in both first and second experiment.",
