Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging has great relevance in CNS pathology, mainly thanks to the multiple, excellent contrasts between tissues. Among its limitations stand long scan times and sensitivity to patients' motion. The present work compared conventional MR sequences with three-dimensional SSFP MRfingerprinting (MRF) with spiral projection k-space trajectories. Through such technique, acquisition of quantitative data of T1, T2, and proton density allows for the post-hoc synthesis of conventional qualitative contrasts with reduced motion sensitivity.

Results: SNR and CNR were comparable between MRF and conventional imaging (p>0.05 for all comparisons, except higher SNR of conventional FLAIR sequences in white matter, p=0.016). In MRF, absolute contrast was higher in T1-weighted (p=0.01) but lower in T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Relative contrast was higher in T1-weighted (p=0.0003) and comparable in T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Although not superior to conventional imaging in anatomical detail, MRF alone provided sequences with high diagnostic confidence in 7/10 patients, while the others needed further MR scans to reach conclusive diagnoses. Conclusion: MRF is a promising tool for MRI in that it may preserve a good diagnostic accuracy while reducing the detriment of a long scan time.",

            "text": "Limitations: The small sample size. Purpose: To evaluate the role of multi b-value synthetic diffusion-weighted imaging in the evaluation of stroke. Methods and materials: 52 patients who presented with symptoms suggestive of stroke with ages of 39-81 years (mean age 49.5+/-10 years; M: F ratio 2:3) were evaluated by a dedicated stroke protocol and supplemented by an additional 2-minute synthetic magic DWI multi b-value protocol after a waiver from IRB. The parameters of synthetic DWI sequence are as follows: multi b-value DWI acquisition with b-values of 0-1,000 and synthesis of b-values of 1,500 and 2,000, with the maximum b-value not exceeding 2,500. The sensitivity of the detection of infarcts on conventional DWI was compared to MAGIC DWI. Results: Of 52 patients, 31 had multiple acute lacunar infarcts in the MCA territory and MCA and PCA watershed zones, 21 in the infratentorial region including the brain stem and cerebellum, and 6 with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 97% with conventional DWI. Using the MAGIC DWI with the synthesis of multiple b-values between 1,000 to 2,500, the sensitivity and specificity significantly improved to 97% and 99%, with an NPV of 99%. Conclusion: Multi B-value ultra-fast synthetic MAGIC DWI, which is a synthetic diffusion technique, is a powerful adjunct tool to the conventional stroke protocol offering the user a retrospective synthetic slider to generate multi b-value data from 100-2,500, increasing the sensitivity of stroke detection with no time or SNR penalties. Purpose: Quantitative assessment of myelination is an important clinical biomarker in treatment and follow-up. Myelin can be measured using synthetic MRI; the measurement of the R1 and R2 relaxation and proton density PD, in conjunction with a myelin model, can provide myelin partial volume maps for the entire brain. Recently, a 3D acquisition method was developed for highresolution, isotropic synthetic MRI. The purpose of this work was to compare myelin detection using 2D and 3D. Methods and materials: The 3D QALAS sequence is a segmented spoiled gradient-echo sequence with 5 parallel acquisitions, interleaved with a T2 preparation and inversion pulse. The 2D MDME sequence (MAGiC) is a saturation recovery multi-slice TSE sequence with multi-echo read-out. A group of 12 volunteers was acquired two times with 3D QALAS and two times with MDME, both at 1.5T and 3T. Results: The mean myelin volume for the entire group was 183 mL and the mean brain volume was 1,300 mL (14.1%). A high correlation was found between volumes determined by QALAS and MDME. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.94 and the mean difference was 0\u00b113 mL. The difference between measurement 1 and 2 was -2\u00b110 mL at 1.5T and 1\u00b113 mL at 3T for QALAS, whereas it was 0\u00b14 mL at 1.5T and -3\u00b14 mL at 3T for MDME. Conclusion: Myelin measurements using 3D QALAS provides very similar values of myelin and brain volumes in comparison to 2D MDME. The advantage of 3D QALAS is the ability to view the data in all orientations.",

Preterm patients were equally divided into GA groups according to the WHO sub-categories: extremely (GA< 28 weeks, EP), very (28-31 weeks and 6 days, VP), and moderate to late preterm (32-37 weeks, MLP). All patients underwent transcranial ultrasound (US) using a Toshiba Aplio500 scanner (Canon Medical Systems Corporation) and a linear 14 MHz transducer. Exams were performed during the first day of life via the anterior fontanel including superficial and deep scans (each on coronal and parasagittal planes). Based on their SMI morphology and location, microvessels were classified as extrastriatal (subdivided into cortical and medullary), striatal, or thalamic. Two examiners independently classified the vessels as visible (echogenic linear structures) or invisible. To assess the association between vessel visibility and GA, a binomial logistic regression analysis (separate for each microvessel group) was performed, taking visibility as a dependent variable and both examiners and GA as predictor variables. Results: A statistically significant difference among GA groups was found in sex (p=0.030), GA by definition (p=0.002), weight at birth (p=0.007), and the Apgar score within 1 minute (p=0.024). GA significantly contributed to the visibility of superficial vessels (p<0.05 for both cortical and medullary ones) but not striatal and thalamic vessels. Conclusion: SMI-US is a feasible tool for visualising and assessing intraparenchymal brain microvasculature in pre-term neonates. The morphology and distribution of the brain microvessels seen in the current study are consistent with those described in previous anatomical and radiological research.

The sensitivity and specificity of both methods were calculated and compared with each other. Results: Compared to conventionally acquired T1-and T2-weighted images, SyMRI-generated contrasts showed a lower sensitivity but a higher specificity Purpose: Metabolic derangements are known to occur after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Animal models point to initial Na + influx causing membrane depolarisation. White matter, particularly the corpus callosum (CC), is susceptible to damage. The purpose of this study is to compare the distribution of the total sodium concentration (TSC) in the CC between patients of mild TBI (mTBI) and controls using sodium MRI. Methods and materials: 11 patients (6 M, 5 F; 20-52 years) with a history of mTBI and 10 healthy controls were studied. Sodium MRI scans were performed on a Siemens Prisma3T scanner using a custom 8-channel dual-tuned (1H-23Na) Tx/Rx head coil. Twisted projection imaging was used (FOV=220 mm, matrix size=64, TE/TR=0.3/100 ms, FA=90, and TA=10.3 min). Sodium MR images were visually inspected in conjunction with proton MPRAGE. TSC was measured in genu, body, and splenium with 5 mm regions of interest (ROI). To assess for reproducibility, 5 measurements were independently taken within each area. A comparison was made between cohorts with a significance level of 0.05. To assess the distribution of TSC along the CC in the anteriorposterior dimension, the TSC genu/splenium ratio was calculated. Results: TSC was higher in the genu (51.59 vs 45.6 mmol, p=0.049) and lower in the splenium (50.80 vs 41.88 mmol, p=0.01) in mTBI patients compared to controls. The genu/splenium ratio was also higher in patients (1.2 vs 0.9, p=0.001). On visual inspection, mTBI subjects demonstrated a reversal of the normal TSC anterior-posterior gradient in the CC compared with controls. Conclusion: TSC distribution in the CC is altered after mTBI. Since changes in extracellular Na + concentration are transient after brain injury, detected alterations in TSC are believed to be attributable to changes in the intracellular Na + concentration. Our work supports the notion of ongoing Na + channelopathy after injury affecting callosal white matter such as perturbed expression of sodium channels. Purpose: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a noninvasive treatment for essential tremor (ET) that allows targeted thermal ablation of brain tissue. Previous studies demonstrate targeting the thalamic ventral intermedius nucleus (Vim) as an effective treatment in ET. This paper describes the world's first trial using MRgFUS to target both the Vim and the inferior zona incerta (ZI). Methods and materials: This prospective study enrolled 13 patients with medication refractory ET for a unilateral MRgFUS procedure. Tremor severity and functional impairment were assessed at baseline and regular intervals posttreatment for 24 months, using the clinical rating scale for tremor (CRST). BFS spirals were also collated intraoperatively, immediately pre-procedure and after targeting the Vim and ZI. All spirals were scored by 3 blinded neurologists. The percentage improvement in the spiral scores after Vim and ZI ablation were compared and analysed. Results: In all patients, there was successful thermal ablation of the target tissue at both Vim and ZI with improvement in all parameters stable over 24 months. The CRST tremor score improved by 73.5% (treated arm) and 24% (non-treated arm Results: 8 3D-features discriminated lesions with a low or high mitotic-count (best AUC 0.81, best sensitivity 86%, and best specificity 93%). 6 3Dparameters detected GISTs based on the mutational group (best AUC 0.77, best sensitivity 75%, and best specificity 79%) and 3 parameters correlated with the risk class (best AUC 0.76, best sensitivity 72%, and best specificity 85%). In the differentiation between GIST at a lower or higher risk of recurrence, the regression model used 6 different features and obtained AUC 0.78, sensitivity 65%, specificity 79%, VPN 71%, and VPP 73% on the training set, and AUC 0.83, sensitivity 88%, and specificity 75% on the test set.",

Results are promising but validation on external datasets will be necessary to confirm the role as an imaging biomarker. Purpose: To accurately identify the relationship between the portal radiomics score (rad-score) and the pathologic superior mesenteric vein (SMV) resection margin in patients with cancer in the head of the pancreas. Methods and materials: 181 patients with pathologically confirmed cancer in the head of the pancreas who underwent multislice computed tomography within one month of resection from January 2016-December 2018 were retrospectively investigated. For each patient, 1,029 radiomics features of the portal phase were extracted, which were reduced using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyse the association between the portal rad-score and SMV resection margin. Results: Patients with negative (R0) and positive (R1) margins accounted for 70.17% (127) and 29.83% (54) of the cohort, respectively. The rad-score, which is based on 11 selected portal phase features, was significantly associated with the SMV resection margin status (P<0.05). Multivariate analyses confirmed a significant and independent association between the portal rad-score and SMV resection margin (P<0.0001); a higher portal rad-score was associated with R1 resection (P for trend <0.0001).",

Purpose: Attenuation characteristics of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and contrast material uptake vary depending on the histological grade and pancreatic parenchyma condition. The purpose of this study was to compare dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) and radiomics features in predicting pancreatic adenocarcinoma grades. The data obtained from an analysis of the radiomics of pancreatic cancer can subsequently be used to predict the prognosis of patients with PDAC and for the inclusion of big data analysis in the diagnosis process. Methods and materials: 62 consecutive patients with histologically-confirmed PDAC who underwent CE-MDCT were enrolled in the study.

Methods and materials: Patients with renal injuries due to bleeding of arterial origin, pseudoaneurysms or arteriovenous fistulas underwent transcatheter arterial embolisation. The analysis included data of the technical and clinical success of embolotherapy, differences performing endovascular treatment during the clinical course and whether the post-interventional modified parenchymal renal volume amplifies the risk of developing renovascular hypertonia and chronic kidney disease. Results: A total of 167 patients was included. The technical success rate was 100 % and a clinical success rate of 92.5 % was achieved. Recurrent bleeding occurred in 14 patients (8.4 %). 6 (42.9 %) were re-embolised and 5 (35.7 %) underwent total nephrectomy. Recurrent bleedings tended to occur in correlation with subcapsular haematomas (p < 0.001). Renal function was measured by glomerular filtration rate and creatinine several times. It revealed no significant changes (p > 0.05). Patients with discontinuity of renal fascia were at a higher risk of parenchymal loss (p = 0.0237). The post-interventional renal volume loss was insignificantly low and over a period of 15 years, neither contributed to the progression of renovascular hypertonia nor to deterioration of renal parameters.

Conclusion: Cystosonography is a sensitive diagnostic technique that allows to identify RVU and to evaluate possible morphological alterations of the renal parenchyma avoiding the use of ionising radiation. Limitations: The limitation of this study are that it is a single centre study and that it refers to a short period of time. Kruskall-Wallis tests showed statistically significant differences between transverse and sagittal tumour diameter, tumour volume, cava-and aorta-tumour contact angle and contact length (in cm) (p<0.005). Outstanding discrimination (>0.9) was found for cavatumour contact angle. The optimal cut-off of 5 cm for transverse tumour diameter was confirmed (SENS 0.75 and 1-SPEC 0.18, CI95% 0.8-1).

Patients were examined by the lead author and a faculty radiologist by B-mode sonography (for plantar fascia thickness), followed by SWE, obtaining a colour map for shear characteristics and quantitative data (shear velocity in cm/s and shear stress in kPa) using a 1x1 cm ROI placed at the position of the highest shear on the colour map. Sensitivity and false-positive rates with extrapolated specificity, PPV, and NPV were calculated, and shear stress cut-off values were obtained using the Chi-square test and ROC curve analysis. The unaffected foot from respective cases was taken as control (normal) for the study. Results: Of 30 examined cases, mean thickness of plantar fascia was significantly higher (5.4 mm) in the affected foot compared to the unaffected (2.9 mm), with a standard ROC cut-off of 3.7 mm (sensitivity 93%, false-positive rate 10%). The mean shear stress in the plantar fascia on the affected side (60.1kPa) differed significantly from the unaffected side (150.7kPa). Taking 97.5kPa as the shear stress cut-off, considering affected patients having values below this cutoff, sensitivity was 81.8% and the false-positive rate was 10.6%. Extrapolated specificity, PPV, and NPV were 89.4%, 88.5%, and 83.1%. AUC was 0.91. Conclusion: SWE shows superior diagnostic accuracy compared to grey-scale sonography in patients with plantar fasciitis and promises the potential for routine use in addition to B-mode US for the assessment of plantar fasciitis cases. Purpose: The increasing use of cone-beam CT to diagnose ankle and foot problems urges the development of quantitative 3D analysis tools that deliver geometrical parameters corresponding to well-known 2D counterparts. We compared estimates of geometrical parameters from both cone-beam CT and radiographs as differences can be expected between 2D and 3D analyses. Methods and materials: WB and non-WB cone-beam CT-images of the left and right hindfoot and forefoot were acquired on a Planmed verity cone-beam CTscanner. Geometric analyses were performed on images of the foot in 2D using simulated radiography images and 3D using custom analysis software. Measurements included the calcaneal pitch, Meary's angle, the angle between 1 st and 2 nd metatarsal (MTT), the talocalcaneal angle, and cuboid height. Results: 5 patients were included with a mean age of 39.6 years. All measurement results were statistically different in 2D and 3D (p<0.001). The average calcaneal pitch decreased in 2D and in both 3D WB compared to non-WB results. Meary's angle decreased in 2D measurements, however, increased using 3D measurements. The average angle between MTT1-2 increased in both approaches. During WB, the talocalcaneal angle decreased in both lateral-lateral and anterior-posterior 2D views and increased in 3D. Cuboid height decreased between non-WB and WB images by 1.3 and 6.5 mm in 2D and 3D images respectively (p<0.001).",

Purpose: Normal saline infusion radiofrequency ablation (NSRFA) is a widely accepted treatment for tumours up to 3 cm in diameter. Microwave ablation (MWA) and hydrochloric acid infusion radiofrequency ablation (HRFA) may be better alternatives for larger tumours, but few studies comparing these 2 modalities have been published. Thus, this study is aiming to compare ablation zone sizes and shapes resulting from HRFA and MWA, using NSRFA as a control in an ex vivo bovine liver model.",

            "text": "The proposed method has been compared to an optimised N4ITK in three experiments. It produces nearly identical results to N4ITK for a benchmark test and similar results in a coefficient of variation, mean absolute error, mean error, and structural similarity for a BrainWeb-based experiment, with an average speedup factor of 137. Different methods performed best for the different investigated tissue types. It was also tested for real cases, often producing more radio realistic bias fields in the cases where N4ITK struggles. Also, no datasets were encountered where the method would not improve image quality. Conclusion: Training a convolutional neural network implicitly, through the relation of the outputs of two similar training samples, is possible, omitting the need for true target data. The achieved model is not only generalised but also achieves comparable accuracy to N4ITK with a significant speedup. In 22 patients, a small local haematoma with a median size of 6 ml without further treatment was observed. 20 patients reported pain within the first hours after the intervention, which was easily treated with metamizole. 1 of those 15 patients with a transhepatic pathway showed an incidental arterioportal fistula in a follow-up CT, which did not require further action. The intervention duration from local anaesthesia to the control scan was a median 16 minutes, with a range of 7-35 minutes, and was well tolerated by the patients. Malignancy was confirmed in 92%. In 2 cases, an adenoma was detected; one lesion showed high FDG-uptake and the other high density on CT. In 2 cases, a definite determination was not possible. Conclusion: CT-guided biopsy of the adrenal gland is a safe, fast, and reliable method to verify and characterise metastases in patients suspected of lung cancer.

Patients without a pre-procedural MRI and a six-month post-procedural MRI were excluded from the study. Both pre-and post-UAE images were independently reviewed by two radiologists with subsequent consensus review. In each, dominant intramural fibroids were identified and the following measurements taken: a) 3-dimensional maximal measurements, b) the shortest distance between the fibroid and the endometrial wall, and c) the shortest distance between the fibroid and the serosal wall. Paired sample t-tests and two-sample t-tests were used to compare between pre-and post-UAE variations and between migrated and non-migrated intramural fibroids, respectively. Results: 35 dominant intramural fibroids were identified, of which, 8 migrated to become submucosal fibroids, while 5 were either partially or completely expelled. All migrating fibroids had a pre-UAE minimum distance from the endometrium of 1-2.4 mm and a maximum fibroid diameter greater than 5.1 cm, and none of the non-migrating fibroids had both these characteristics together. Conclusion: Not only is it distressing to patients to have post-procedural pain and bleeding, but fibroid migration could also increase infection risks and affect fertility. Our study found that intramural fibroids with a minimum endometrial distance less than 2.4 mm and a maximum fibroid diameter greater than 5.1 cm have a high likelihood of migrating after UAE.

We also noticed a significant reduction or disappearance of clinical symptoms such as pain, menorrhagia, and pressure symptoms. The partial vascularisation of leiomyoma was only detected in one case 24 months after UAE. Conclusion: UAE is an effective, minimal-invasive form of leiomyoma treatment. MRI and US are the modalities that can accurately estimate fibroid changes and blood flow in uterine arteries. The tendency of fibroid shrinkage after UAE is well-defined in the period from 1-24 months.

Methods and materials: 24 patients with newly diagnosed, histopathologicallyproven, focal unilateral prostate cancer were treated with US-guided transperineal focal laser ablation as a primary treatment. The inclusion criteria were no previous prostate treatment, a PSA level \u226420, a Gleason score \u22647, and stage \u2264 T2b N0M0 with 3T multi-parametric MRI-visible index lesion (PIRADS \u2265 4). After the ablation, a 3T mpMRI of the prostate was obtained. Follow-up consisted of mpMRI at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and a US/MRI fusion-guided biopsy at 6 and 12 months. Results: 24 patients were successfully treated with transperineal US-guided focal laser ablation. No complications occurred. The IPSS and SHIM did not significantly change after treatment. The mean operation time was 38.2 minutes (range 32.6-42.5), the mean ablation time was 21.7 minutes (range 18.3-26.8), the mean energy deployed was 3606J (range 3212-3804), the mean hospital stay was 113 minutes (range 55-178), and the mean catheterisation time was 261 minutes (range 95-412). At the 6-and 12-month follow-up, prostate mpMRI and US/MRI fusion-guided biopsy showed neither evidence of local residual disease nor recurrence.

Ethics committee approval: Protocol approved by the ethical committee of Policlinico Tor Vergata (Rome). Purpose: To evaluate our decision-making between RFA and CA based on tumour size, central position, and nearness to the collecting system on technical efficacy and oncologic outcomes for cT1 RCC. Methods and materials: All cT1 RCC from 2005-2019 were included. Patients treated before 2013 were included in the RFA group and patients treated after 2013 were included in the CA or RFA group, where CA was performed for large (\u226735 mm) central tumours or RCC with a nearness to the collecting system, while RFA was performed for smaller (<35 mm) and non-central RCC. The IPTW based on clinical and tumour features was applied. The primary success was compared using logistic regression, while local recurrence-free survival was compared using Cox proportional hazards regression. Clavien complications and the change in renal function (MDRD) were also evaluated. Results: Data from 408 patients were analysed. The primary success rate was higher in the CA or RFA group compared to the RFA group (97.1% vs 87.1%, p<0.001). Local recurrence-free survival was better in the CA or RFA group compared to the RFA group (HR=0.49; 95%CI: 0.28-0.84; p=0.01). Survival without metastases was not different (p=0.65). The incidence of Clavien grade \u22652 adverse events (p=0.30) and the change of renal function (p=0.35) was similar. Conclusion: Our decision-making between CA and RFA achieved a better primary success rate and local recurrence-free survival compared to RFA alone, with excellent oncologic outcomes for RFA in selected patients and also for large and central RCC mainly treated with CA. Limitations: The retrospective design. Ethics committee approval: Institutional review board approval was obtained to review the medical records of patients who underwent ablation of RCC at Necker University Hospital. ",

The aetiology was traumatic in 7 cases, ruptured neoplasm in 8 cases, and spontaneous in 2 patients assuming oral anticoagulant therapy. After thin slice contrast-enhanced CT, a super-selective embolisation was conducted with different embolising agents according to the type of vessel lesion and operator preference. Results: Technical success rate, considered as an interruption of adrenal bleeding detectable at angiography, was 94.1%. Clinical success rate, considered as haemodynamic stability restoration within 24 hours from the procedure, was 82.3%. The vessels involved were the superior adrenal artery in 5 patients, the middle adrenal artery in 8 patients, the inferior adrenal artery in one patient, and more than one adrenal artery in 3 patients. No procedure-related major complications occurred and no patients had infarctions, necrosis, abscess formation, or required long-term steroid supplementation. Conclusion: Acute adrenal haemorrhages can be safely and effectively managed by catheter-directed embolisations. The source of bleeding has to be carefully investigated at CT and angiography as adrenal glands present with a wide and complex vascular arterial network.",

            "text": "Purpose: Stroke is one of the main causes of disability in adults. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is able to map functionalanatomic networks by analysing spontaneously correlated low-frequency activity fluctuations across the brain. However, the role of rs-fMRI to predict the functional outcome after acute stroke remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the impact of rs-fMRI at 72h after stroke symptoms onset to predict the functional outcome at 1-year follow-up. Methods and materials: 35 reperfused stroke patients (12 female, age: 68\u00b114 years, 3-day national institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS) score: 6\u00b15) were consecutively scanned 72 hours after symptom onset. A modified Rankin scale (mRS) was used to evaluate functional outcome at 90 days (patients with good functional outcome, mRS \u22642; poor outcome, mRS>2). Image pre-processing included motion and slice-timing correction, outliers' detection, brain tissue segmentation, MNI space normalisation, smoothing, and band-pass filtering to remove undesired components. Region-of-interest analyses were performed to calculate the correlation coefficients for every pairwise region and a weighted general linear model was used to discover significative differences (p<0.05 FWE) between groups. Results: Patients with good outcome presented higher intra-network connectivity, while patients with poor outcome showed lower inter-network connectivity. To predict the 1-year functional outcome after a stroke, the 3-day NIHSS score was the most relevant predictor. An accuracy of 74.3% was obtained through a discriminant model using only clinical scores. Adding anatomical networks increased accuracy to 88.6%, 97.1% (including functional networks), and 100% (with clinical and imaging variables). Conclusion: These results show the relevance of rs-fMRI in the acute phase to predict the long-term functional outcome in stroke patients. Purpose: This study applied brain resting and task state fMRI to detect the changes of brain activity and explore the mechanism of neurological damage in adult patients with common exotropia. Methods and materials: 20 patients (M:10, F:10) and 20 age-and sex-matched controls with normal corrected visual acuity from 18 to 26 years of age were enrolled in this study. Two independent samples t-tests were employed to measure the differences of regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of lowfrequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the resting-state fMRI and the brain-activity difference in the visual stimuli task fMRI of two groups. Results: Compared with healthy controls, patients had significantly higher ReHo in the right middle occipital gyrus and the left supramarginal gyrus, and lower values in the right cingulate gyrus, the right precentral gyrus, the right superior temporal gyrus, and the left frontal sub-gyral lobe (P<0.05). Patients showed a reduced ALFF in the left superior parietal lobe, the right middle cingulate gyrus, the left anterior cingulate gyrus, and the right inferior temporal gyrus (P<0.05).",

Conclusion: Common exotropia may lead to disorders in the processing of visual-spatial information and the control of emotion and attention. Purpose: Task-based fMRI is the method of choice for determining the hemispheric dominance of language function. One important limitation is that the technique depends on the patient's ability to perform the task. The aim of our study was to test the feasibility of using resting-state fMRI instead of task-based approaches. Methods and materials: 15 healthy native English speakers underwent restingstate fMRI and two language fMRI paradigms: a verbal fluency (VF) and one verb generation (VG). Task-based fMRI was analysed using both a general linear model (GLM) in the SPM software and independent component analysis (ICA). Resting-state fMRI data was analysed by using both ICA and principal component analysis (PCA) using the SPM CONN toolbox, assuming a fixed number of 20 components.

The direct comparison showed that MOH patients had significantly decreased smReHo activation in the right Heschl's gyrus (p<0.05, FDR corrected), which was corresponding to the highest weight area by machine learning classifier. A negative correlation was observed between the duration of medication intake and smReHo activation in the right Heschl's gyrus (r=-0.433, p<0.05). Conclusion: With machine learning computational analyses, our study was able to diagnose MOH patients on a single subject level by demonstrating decreased regional function in MOH patients, notably involving the right Heschl's gyrus, suggesting the right Heschl's gyrus might play an important role in the pathogenesis of MOH.

Purpose: The reorganisation of language is common in epilepsy patients and a relevant factor in surgical therapy. The non-invasive gold standard in presurgical evaluation is language fMRI. fMRI network analysis could reveal subtle changes in language network architecture so far invisible with standard analyses and thus provide relevant additional information. We aimed to investigate the reorganisation processes of language networks in surgical patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using standard fMRI activation and recent network analysis. Methods and materials: Task-based language fMRIs were performed on 28 TLE patients (16 right/12 left) before and after surgery, and on 22 healthy controls. FMRI activation analysis, a derived laterality index, and functional connectivity of global and language networks were used to investigate language architecture. Naming, semantic, and phonematic verbal fluency were correlated with imaging parameters. Results: Both left and right TLE were associated with widespread language network alterations, particularly ipsilesional, before, and more pronounced after surgery. Preoperatively, mesiotemporal connectivity was decreased in left TLE, while postoperatively bihemispheric changes with a shift to more atypical language laterality (especially frontal) occurred. In right TLE, right intrahemispheric frontotemporal functional connectivity was attenuated before and further decreased after surgery, while those patients with stronger connectivity scored worse in semantic verbal fluency. Better postoperative naming ability was generally accompanied by stronger interhemispheric frontal connectivity. In all cases, network analysis revealed more widespread alterations than activation analysis.",

Purpose: Diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGG) have a slow infiltrating character, allowing for simultaneous plasticity and maintaining the patients' functional capacity. Here we addressed whether and how anatomical disconnection following left-hemispheric DLGG growth and resection interferes with restingstate connectivity, specifically in relation to language. Methods and materials: 39 native French persons with a left DLGG were included and underwent awake surgical resection of the tumour. The anatomical disconnectivity risk following the DLGG volume and the resection, and the functional connectivity of resting-state fMRI images in relation to language, were evaluated prior to and three months after surgery. Resting-state connectivity B A C 604 Saturday Scientific Programme patterns were compared with 19 healthy controls. Language was assessed with a picture-naming task. Results: Adaptive plasticity was observed in regions around the tumour/cavitas area, with increased connectivity of the left and right inferior parietal lobule with the left inferior temporal gyrus. Picture naming was surprisingly not dependent on the connectivity of the language network, but of the connectivity of regions know to be involved in semantics, in which their specific role could be explained in the light of the broader resting-state network they took part in. Also, the recruitment of the frontoparietal attention network was observed. Conclusion: A whole-brain approach with specific clinical data input is required for meaningful resting-state analysis in case of lesions. Pre-surgical local plasticity and functional compensation by increased task-directed attention allow a relative high level of performance maintenance after DLGG resection. Limitations: All participants underwent intensive speech-language rehabilitation post-surgery, which might have trained and strengthened attentional resources. Purpose: There have been accumulating studies demonstrating thalamic related structural, functional, and metabolic abnormalities in minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). We conducted the first study to investigate thalamicrelated structural connectivity alterations in MHE. Methods and materials: Diffusion based probabilistic tractography was used to determine the structural connection between the thalamus and the cortical/subcortical regions in 22 cirrhotic patients with MHE, 30 cirrhotic patients without MHE (NHE), and 30 healthy controls. DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) measurements of these thalamic connections, including connectivity strength (CS), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), were calculated and compared across three groups. Neuropsychological assessment was performed as well. The correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between neuropsychological performance and the measurements about thalamic connections. Machine-learning classification analysis was performed to estimate whether diffusion measurements can distinguish MHE from NHE. Results: The probabilistic tractography revealed thalamic structural connection, which was disturbed in cirrhotic patients (reflected by decreased CS/FA and increased MD/AD/RD). Abnormal thalamic connection primarily involved the prefrontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, parietal cortex, medial temporal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Thalamic connectivity abnormalities deteriorated from NHE to MHE and correlated with patients' impaired neuropsychological performance. The relatively high classification accuracy was obtained using CS as a discriminating index. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the altered thalamic structural connectivity with both cortical and subcortical regions in MHE. The disturbed thalamic connectivity may underlie the mechanism about cognitive deficits in MHE and can serve as biomarker for the diagnosis of MHE and monitoring disease progression.

The coupling of functional-structural brain connectome was compared by using permutation tests. To investigate the clinical relevance of altered brain network topologies in USSHL, Pearson's correlation analysis was performed between the clinical variables and the topological properties. Results: Compared with the control groups, both groups of USSHL patients exhibited a significantly increased clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and local efficiency, but a significantly decreased characteristic path length in functional brain connectome, while a significant decrease clustering coefficient and local efficiency in structural brain connectome. In addition, the primary increased nodal strength was observed in limbic and paralimbic systems primarily as well as in the auditory network brain areas. More importantly, the coupling strength of structural-functional connectome was decreased and exhibited a negative correlation with some USSHL clinical variables in patients. Conclusion: Detectable alteration of network organisation already occurred in USSHL patients within the acute period at the global and regional level. The functional connectome is characterised by a shift toward small-worldization while the structural connectome is toward randomisation, which may indicate a plastic reorganisation procedure of the brain to compensate for the loss of hearing in USSHL.

Results: fMRI lateralisation correlated significantly with structural connectome graph parameters in a task-dependent fashion. The temporal lateralisation of speech comprehension and auditory decision and the frontal lateralisation of picture naming and synonym decision showed significant positive correlations with network metrics-based lateralisation parameters of the temporoparietal areas. The lateralisation of frontal language areas was also reflected in the lateralisation of arcuate fasciculus (AF).",

A near-homogeneous blue colour in the spinal cord and cauda equina was considered normal in our study, with the blue colour representing diffusion in the craniocaudal direction. Alteration in colour, thickness, and integrity, especially at the level of compression on T2W images, was considered significant. Results: Out of 12 patients, 9 had signs of CSCM secondary to infective spondylodiskitis, 1 secondary to a disk protrusion, 1 secondary to a disk extrusion, and 1 secondary to the metastatic collapse of the vertebra. In 8/12 patients with no spinal cord parenchymal signal alteration on T2W images, DTT revealed significant alteration in the colour-code both at and above the level of compression, signifying altered diffusion. Conclusion: DTT is a more sensitive indicator of spinal cord compression than conventional MRI by revealing colour alterations, thinning and loss of integrity of spinal nerve fibre tracts, and providing an easy and fast tool to predict the need for surgical decompression.

The data was analysed using a GLM with predictors corresponding to different stimulus types and button presses. A random-effects analysis for the population was performed using a t-test over the individual contrast images. Purpose: Our retrospective study investigates whether a correlation exists between functional language lateralisation using fMRI and structural lateralisation using diffusion data of language tracts in controls and tumour patients. Methods and materials: 15 controls and 61 patients were included and underwent structural, functional, and diffusion imaging on 3T MRI. Subjects performed verbal fluency and verb generation language fMRI tasks, and a laterality index (LI) was calculated using data from the cerebral hemisphere and the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. The diffusion tracts included the long fibres of the arcuate fasciculus, anterior and posterior short fibres of the arcuate fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, and frontal aslant tract. An asymmetry index (AI) for each fibre pair was calculated using the tract volume derived from single tensor (ST) and spherical deconvolution (SD) diffusion data, as well as using the hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy (HMOA) derived from the SD method. A linear regression analysis between fMRI LI and DTI AI was performed. Results: In all subjects, there was no significant correlation between fMRI LI and DTI AI for any of the tracts. Conclusion: Our results do not justify replacing fMRI with tractography in the assessment of language lateralisation. The discordant results between ST-and SD-based asymmetry indices indicate that the structural lateralisation is less robust than the functional one.",

(daniel.preuss@mailbox.org) Purpose: To investigate whether perfusion defect (PD) interpretation of myocardial CT perfusion (CTP) should be different in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD) for the detection of obstructive CAD. Methods and materials: A total of 134 consecutive patients with known or suspected CAD prospectively underwent CTP. Rest and stress PDs were retrospectively interpreted in four reading categories (RC): RC 1 (stress volume positive), RC 2 (rest or stress volume positive), RC 3 (stress-induced PDs positive), RC 4 (stress-induced and partially reversible PDs positive). Detection of \u226550% diameter stenosis in the supplying artery on quantitative coronary angiography (reference 1) and intervention (reference 2) served as the reference standards. Results: When using reference 1, per-patient analysis revealed AUCs of RC 1-4 of 0.74, 0.65, 0.62, and 0.72, respectively, in patients with known CAD. In these patients, AUC of RC 1 was higher than RC 3 (P= .03) and, respectively, AUC of RC 4 was higher than RC 3 (P= .006). In patients with suspected CAD, AUCs of RC 1-4 were the same (0.83, 0.86, 0.85, 0.88; all P> .05). When using reference 2, AUCs of RC 1-4 in patients with known CAD (0.61, 0.60, 0.67, 0.69) and, respectively, in patients with suspected CAD (0.75, 0.80, 0.76, 0.80) were the same at per-patient level analysis (all P> .05). Conclusion: In patients with known or suspected CAD, every stress PD should be judged positive to detect obstructive CAD in myocardial CTP regardless of its presentation in rest.

Scans were obtained with dual-source CT scanner (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens, Erlangen) with retrospective ECG-gated acquisition and bolus-tracking technique. Twodimensional TA was performed using commercial software (TexRAD Ltd, Cambridge, UK), with a filtration histogram method, on polygonal regions-ofinterest (ROI) manually drawn by a single operator on native axial sections reconstructed in diastole and systole; ROIs encompassed the interventricular septum below aortic valve level. Septal thickness (ST), ejection fraction (EF), and aortic valve area (AVA) were recorded in each patient, in order to correlate such parameters with TA features. Statistical analysis was carried out using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) linear regression model. Significance was fixed at P=0,05. Results: After LASSO analysis 10 TA features were significantly correlated with ST; a radiomic score was calculated (mean value 14,57) with linear regression coefficient 1,3389 (p=2,22x10 -11 ; R 2 =0,2299). 12 TA features were significantly correlated with EF; a radiomic score was calculated (mean value 52,33) with linear regression coefficient 1,2790 (p=5,39x10 -16 ; R 2 =0,2804). 8 TA features were significantly correlated with AVA; a radiomic score was calculated (mean value 0,6670) with linear regression coefficient 1,9824 (p=2,55x10 -5 ; R 2 =0,08807). Conclusion: TA features extracted for myocardial septum correlate with morphologic and functional parameters in patients affect by SA. The correlation with ST suggests a possible correspondence between TA features and myocardial fibrosis or disarray. Limitations: The single-centre study, study design retrospective, small sample. Ethics committee approval: All patients gave written consent to CT. Purpose: To estimate the clinical value of MR tissue tracking in the assessment of left ventricular remodeling in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and materials: 29 patients with T2DM as well as 21 healthy controls were enrolled. Cardiac magnetic resonance(CMR)was used to obtain left ventricular function parameters while MR tissue tracking to get peak strains (PS. Radial PS\uff0c circumferential PS and longitudinal PS were calculated with global and 16 regional segments in DM and healthy controls. Together with LVEF\uff0c LVEDV and LV Mass, peak strains were compared between DM and controls. Results: LVEF and global longitudinal PS, basal longitudinal PS were statistical significantly smaller for DM (-16.51\u00b12.76 vs -18.00\u00b12.15\uff0cP\uff1c0.05; and -11.26\u00b13.69 vs -13.35\u00b13.16 P\uff1c0.05; respectively) . Global and segmental PS had a statistical significant correlation with LVEF (r=0.63, 0.407, 0.571, 0.517, 0.627, 0.243, 0.615, 0.655 , P\uff1c0 .05 separately). Global and basal radial PS\uff0cmid longitudinal PS had a significant-good correlation with HaB1C (r=-0.375, -0.367, 0.381\uff0cP\uff1c0.05); separate PS had a poor diagnostic value while the union of apical radial PS\uff0cbasal circumferential PS, global/basal/apical longitudinal PS had a relatively good sensitivity and specify to distinguish DM from healthy controls. Conclusion: There is a statistically significant difference between DM and healthy controls on peak strain\uff0cwhich serves an early measurement of left ventricular remodelling which could potentially be included as a supplementary diagnostic procedure in the evaluation of DM. Limitations: We didn't discuss the left ventricular systolic function of DM.

Purpose: Heart failure is a clinical diagnosis characterised by non-specific symptoms such as dyspnoea, fatigue and oedema. The European Society of Cardiology recommends obtaining objective measures for heart failure in order to confirm a diagnosis. However, it can be challenging to obtain objective measures such as echocardiography in the acute setting. CTPA is conventionally used to outrule pulmonary embolus, however, CTPA provides great detail of the heart and lungs as a whole. The aim of this study was to investigate what role CTPA could play in diagnosing heart failure. Methods and materials: We reviewed 230 CTPA results, of these we confirmed which of these patients had heart failure by confirming a heart failure diagnosis with BNP and echocardiogram criteria. We divided the groups into those who had heart failure and those that did not. We then analysed which features found on CTPA were most specific for a diagnosis of heart failure. Purpose: To evaluate the role of the left atrium and left atrial appendage in the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after radiofrequency ablation. Methods and materials: 63 patients with AF who underwent radiofrequency ablation for the first time were enrolled. According to the recurrence of AF after radiofrequency ablation, the patients were divided into the recurrence group (n = 20 cases) and non-recurrence group (n = 43 cases). All patients underwent a 256-slice spiral CT examination before the operation. The maximum volume of LAA (LAAVmax), minimum volume of LAA (LAAVmin), LAA emptying fraction (LAAEF), and LAA ejection volume (LAAEV), LAA volume strain (LAA-VS), maximum volume of LA (LAVmax), minimum volume of LA (LAVmin), LA emptying fraction (LAEF), LA ejection volume (LAEV), and LA volume strain (LAVS) were measured. Results: The LAAVmax, LAAVmin, LAVmax, and LAVmin in the recurrence group were higher than those in the non-recurrence group (P < 0.05), while LAAEF, LAEF and LAA-VS in the recurrence group were lower than those in the non-recurrence group (P < 0.05). There was no difference in LA-VS between the two groups. LAAEF was an independent predictor of recurrence after radiofrequency ablation of AF. LAAEF < 44.68% had the highest predictive value for recurrence after radiofrequency ablation. Purpose: To reproduce the feasibility of estimating myocardial extracellular volume fraction (ECV) through routine contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in a cohort of oesophagal cancer patients and to investigate the correlation between an increase in ECV and exposure to radiation therapy. Methods and materials: After ethics committee approval, patients with oesophagal cancer who had undergone routine CT examinations before and after radiation therapy were retrospectively analysed. For each patient, we considered pre-treatment CT and the post-treatment CT with the longest followup interval available. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, who previously had undergone cardiotoxic chemotherapy, or with heavily artefacted CT images were excluded. ECV was measured using round regions of interest (ROI) in the septum at mid-level, accounting for movement by excluding borders, and in the left ventricular blood pool at the same level. Septal ECV was calculated using the formula proposed by Bandula et al. T-test for paired data was used to compare distributions. Results: Twenty-one subjects were analysed, with a mean age of 64\u00b118 years, four of which were women. Pre-treatment mean ECV was 27.89\u00b13.54% and post-treatment mean ECV at follow-up was 32.08\u00b14.51% with a median interval of 197 days. Post-treatment ECV was significantly higher than pre-treatment ECV (p<0.001). Conclusion: ECV in oesophageal cancer patients showed to be significantly higher after treatment. Its rise after radiation therapy could play a role in the screening of myocardial condition in oesophageal cancer patients undergoing such treatment.",

The first unit used the tube voltage in line with the European guidelines (79kV) while the other unit's tube voltage was not in line with the EU guidelines (63 kV). The data was collected only for the AP projection. After the data collection, the calculations of BMI, effective dose, and dose to selected organs were calculated using a PCXMC2.0 Monte Carlo simulation program. Results: No statistically significant difference was found between the BMIs of the compared groups (p=0.671). When the optimal exposure parameters were used, the DAP value was lower by 79% (p<0.001), the effective dose by 62% (p<0.001), and the average dose to the organs by 73% (p<0.001). The image field was significantly larger when the optimal parameters were used. Therefore, the dose difference should be even higher when the optimal exposure parameters were used if the field size would be the same. Conclusion: Based on the results, we can conclude that the DAP, effective dose, and dose to organs are significantly higher when the exposure parameters used are not in line with the European guidelines.

The dose area product (DAP) of all examinations was recorded, keeping all other variables constant. Image quality evaluation was performed by 5 radiologists performing absolute visual grading analysis (VGA) using an image quality score tool, with the resultant scores analysed using visual grading characteristics (VGC). Results: A 10 cm air-gap in conjunction with a source-to-image distance (SID) of 121 cm was found as the optimal air-gap technique. The clinical application of this technique resulted in a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction in the radiation dose of 72% in terms of DAP.

We collected 20 radiographs for each focal spot (FS) setting using every IS. The test plate was placed at 20 mm intervals along the z-axis in order to reveal the potential impact of the anode heel effect and focal effect on image quality. We used exposures of 0.5 mAs at 81 kVp in order to avoid noise elimination and saturation. We upgraded our pilot FIJI macro to include affine image transformation functionality and DICOM header interaction. The macro was used to carry out the consistent characterisation of ETR-1's line-pair segments. This data was exported to a series of spreadsheets which were subjected to B A C 617 Sunday Scientific Programme percentile-based formatting as well as an absolute threshold. We also compared equivalent data points belonging to different FS sizes using subtraction. Results: Our results take the form of 1 spreadsheet for each combination of IS and FS setting, containing contrast maintenance values for 20 different spatial frequencies belonging to each exposure. Percentile-based formatting revealed a deterioration of image quality at the margin of every FOV. This effect was more pronounced on the anode side. Threshold implementation revealed minimum levels of contrast at spatial frequencies consistent with each datasets' respective IS limiting spatial resolution. Subtraction revealed that larger FS produce lower quality radiographs.

Purpose: The annotating process is tedious and time-consuming. Effectively selecting a minimum number of representative unannotated training datasets out of a large-scale heterogeneous dataset is challenging. Our purpose was to identify training datasets iteratively and retrain current model to segment thigh muscle and produce state-of the-art segmentation performance. Methods and materials: IRB-approved 3,000 clinical CT images were used for this study. A 3D-UNet base model, which was previously trained to segment thigh volume into 11 muscle classes by a small cohort of reference datasets, was used. An iterative active learning framework was developed which identified the datasets out of all datasets where base model segmentation prediction had a higher uncertainty in prediction and could produce a positive effect on segmentation accuracy if used for re-training. Identified datasets were further clustered by their similarity features and 10 representative datasets were selected for annotation in each iteration. All re-trained models performance was evaluated by randomly selected 18 test thigh volume datasets. We compared the average surface distance (ASD) as a segmentation performance metric when the base model was re-trained by the same number of randomly chosen datasets. Results: After the second iteration, the evaluation indicates a 53% improvement in median ASD over all muscle class as compared to a 22% increase when retrained with randomly chosen datasets. Paired t-test with a statistical significance score (p < 0.005) shows clear improvement of the segmentation performance. Conclusion: Retraining a base model with the identified datasets by the active learning framework achieved higher segmentation accuracy in comparison to when trained with a randomly selected dataset. To keep the segmentation performance at the expected range for growing datasets, the framework finds the effective training datasets for annotation and reduces unnecessary annotation workload. Purpose: The Research Consortium for Medical Image Analysis (RECOMIA) is a not-for-profit organisation with the objective of promoting research in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and medical imaging. RECOMIA aims at minimising the time and effort researchers need to spend on technical aspects such as display and transfer of DICOM images, legal aspects such as de-identification, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance, and quality aspects such as display tools so that medical experts can review and correct AI-segmentations in a cloud-based DICOM-viewer. Methods and materials: Radiologists and nuclear medicine specialists have used the RECOMIA platform to manually annotate up to 100 organs in more than 300 CT studies. Not all organs were annotated in all images; in total, more than 10,000 were annotated. The manual annotations were used to train convolutional neural networks (CNN) to perform automated organ segmentation in CT images. The CT scans were split into training (80%) and validation (20%) groups.",

Conversely, there was agreement on 94.7% of the automatically-labelled pixels. The pixels considered background both manually and by the CNN are not included in these numbers. The run-time of the CNNs was about 2 minutes on a desktop computer. Conclusion: AI-based tools can provide highly accurate and reproducible organ segmentation, similar to those obtained manually by radiologists, but much faster. We continue to train new CNNs to continuously improve performance. Purpose: To create a general methodology of the generation of databases for machine learning algorithms Methods and materials: 450 anonymised chest CTs were included in the dataset. The RadiAnt DICOM Viewer has been chosen for modifying and dealing with the dataset. The prepared dataset was archived on the server of the oncological centre before the morphological diagnostics. Then the data was anonymised with the DicomCleaner\u2122, renaming them with a special code. We used nodule's shape, internal, and external structure as a feature and represented them into histograms for radiomix. After the morphologic confirmation, we assigned some class label to each case. Results: We created the database LIRA (Lung Image Resource Annotated) for the development and testing of CAD. All cases were confirmed morphologically. In our study, 65% of LCs had a typical CT, 26% of CT images corresponded to different diseases which require an additional differential diagnostic criteria, and 9% of LC cases were extremely difficult to recognise by means of CT due to an atypical visualisation image. Class labels for subsets were \"typical LC\", \"atypical\", and \"not cancer\". Conclusion: One of the conditions for successfully using the medical CAD systems is a correctly created database which corresponds with clinical and radiological interpretation. We would like to point out that the main proposed idea of the methodology of creating the medical databases can be formulated as follows: structurisation of the data, their homogenisation and verification of diseases, and the inclusion of the \"atypical\" cases and cases which look similar to studying disease. The dataset LIRA contains class labels for each nodule to develop the differential diagnostic intellectual algorithm. CT lung (open dataset). Methods and materials: 95 patients (65 training and 30 validation cohorts) who had undergone pre-treatment 18F-FDG-PET studies were included and classified as those who achieved complete pathological response (pCR) and those who did not. The primary tumours were segmented using a fixed threshold approach, radiomic features were extracted, features were annotated according to the international biomarker standardisation initiative. Feature reduction with the minimum redundancy maximum relevance method was performed. Logistical regression and random forest models for clinical outcomes were constructed and compared using ROC curves, decision curves, and McNemar's test.",

Purpose: The value proposition of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in healthcare have been well described and it is apparent that 'narrow AI' will have a role in every stage of the clinical workflow. The deployment of AI solutions in the clinical workflow of a multi-country healthcare organisation has many challenges, but establishing a systematic and unified framework can lead to successful outcomes. By defining measurable performance indicators, it is possible to track in real-time whether actions give benefits to all stakeholders; patients, referrers, and business partners.",

Discrepancies of their reviewing results were analysed and evaluated by Cohen's Kappa index. Results: There were 18 cases that were diagnosed differently by the two senior radiologists when they reviewed the CXR images alone. With the assistance of the AI diagnostic system, the number of differentially diagnosed cases dropped to 7 cases, leading to a 61.1% reduction in discrepancies. Of note, the Kappa scores increased from 0.806 to 0.928 after utilising the AI diagnostic system. In particular, according to the ground truth of these CXR images, utilisation of the AI diagnostic system eliminated 17 discrepancy cases in which 8 false-positive cases and 7 false-negative cases were corrected. Meanwhile, among the 6 new introduced discrepancy cases, one was a false-positive case that was corrected by one radiologist with the help of the AI system.",

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can affect oxygenation levels in renal parenchyma, which influences the clinical course of the disease. Furosemide may make Na+ -K+ -ATP pump work reduction and oxygen consumption decrease. The goal of this study was to assess renal oxygenation levels in CKD using BOLD-MRI when injecting furosemide. Methods and materials: 18 healthy subjects and 39 patients with CKD underwent a renal scan using a multi-gradient-recalled-echo (mGRE) sequence with 16 echoes, and 28 of 39 patients underwent the same sequence 7 minutes after injecting furosemide. R2* values of three regions of interest (ROI) of the renal cortex and medulla were measured and their average values were calculated. The difference of R2* was compared between the healthy subjects and all patients. According to eGFR, 28 patients with injected furosemide were divided into a normal eGFR group (group 1,\u226590 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and an abnormal eGFR group (group 2,<90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), and the changes of R2* in the two groups after injection were compared. 28 of the 39 patients were confirmed by ultrasound-guided puncture and the other 11 patients had a similar diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and investigations. Purpose: To retrospectively determine the diagnostic values of a VI-RAD score for the detection of muscle invasion in patients with bladder tumours. Methods and materials: This study included 347 consecutive patients with 339 tumour lesions who were previously diagnosed by CT imaging and subsequently underwent bladder multiparametric MR imaging between January 2015 and March 2019. Lesions level analyses were performed by using an overall score of VI-RADS. Histologic examination of TURBT was used as the reference standard. Two radiologists assessed the diagnostic scores of tumours with muscle invasion by using cutoff values of \u2265 4 and \u2265 3. Cutoff values for VI-RADS scores were estimated from operating points of AUC analyses. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were calculated to assess the utility of VI-RADS Results: The interobserver agreement was excellent for three different MR imaging at the lesion level. T2W and DW imaging had a similar diagnostic accuracy of 79.3% for tumour lesions with muscle invasion compared to the overall score of 80.2%, with a cutoff value of 4. The overall VI-RAD score showed an accuracy of 80.2%, with a cutoff value of \u2265 4, granting a sensitivity of 91.3%, specificity of 76.0%, PPV of 83.3%, and NPV of 78.9%. When we applied an arbitrary overall score of \u2265 3, accuracy was 63.7%, sensitivity was 94.6%, specificity was 43.9%, PPV was 51.6%, and NPV was 63.7%. Conclusion: VI-RADS has an overall good performance for the diagnosis of tumours with muscle invasion. Limitations: The current study was a single-centre retrospective study with a small number of participants. As a consequence, a statistical significance was not observed in comparing each result. For these results to be more definitive, prospective studies with larger numbers of patients are required. Ethics committee approval: n/a Funding: No funding was received for this work. Purpose: Cochlear implantation is the recommended treatment for patients presenting with severe to profound pre-or post-lingual sensorineural hearing loss. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the selection of candidates. A pre-operative knowledge of variant anatomy helps in the planning of the surgical approach and aids in identifying potential complications. Methods and materials: Patients suffering from profound to severe sensorineural hearing loss with the candidacy for cochlear implantation were evaluated by high-resolution CT of the temporal bone (HRCT). A total of 100 cases were referred from July 2018 to February 2019 and were included in the study after taking patient consent. Many anatomical variants were observed including mastoid pneumatisation, level of middle cranial fossa dura, Korner's septum, mastoid emissary vein, sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb position, bony facial canal, position of mastoid segment of facial nerve canal with respect to round window for visualisation of round window during surgery and alignment of cochlear basal turn with respect to axis of internal carotid artery canal for round window accessibility.",

Purpose: Computed tomography (CT) features are the reference standard in evaluating the ossification process of the medial clavicular epiphysis for forensic age diagnostics in adolescents and young adults. Consequently, the highest efforts on radiation reduction are warranted. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of low-dose CT of the clavicula for age estimation. Methods and materials: 207 non-contrast chest CT of 144 patients born between 1988-2012, performed in 2018 due to various clinical indications, were included in this retrospective study. The mean patient age was 16.9\u00b16.6 years. Patients were divided into a low-dose (LD; n=146) and high-dose (HD; n=61) group. Image quality and ossification stages (using the 5-stage classification including the subgroups 2a-3c) were assessed by two radiologists independently. Confidence levels were evaluated for subgroups 2a-3c. Radiation dose was determined via dosimetry software. Results: A dose simulation with a z-axis reduction to depict the clavicula only resulted in a median exposure of 0.1 mSv (IQR: 0.0) in LD compared to 0.9 mSv (IQR: 0.6) in HD (p<0.001). The median image quality was rated significantly worse in LD compared to HD with a median of 3 (IQR: 1) versus 4 (IQR: 0) by both readers on a Likert-scale ranging from 1-4 (p<0.001 for both readers). There was an almost perfect agreement for the ossification stages between both readers with a Cohen's kappa of 0.83 (p<0.001). Median confidence levels of both readers were not significantly different between LD and HD (reader 1: p=0.186; reader 2: p=0.074). Conclusion: Low-dose CT of the clavicula for age estimation is possible without a loss of confidence. Purpose: To investigate differences in perfusion-MRI parameters between healthy and pathologic regions in patients with a histologically confirmed medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). Methods and materials: in a retrospective analysis, standard parameters of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) perfusion MRI of 22 patients, who received the examinations as part of a dedicated clinical MRI protocol for MRONJ assessment, were evaluated. Same sized regions of interest were placed into a representative bone of defined regions. All regions were assessed qualitatively by a blinded expert radiologist as ground truth (4-point Likert-scale; normal, mildsevere changes). Furthermore, histologic confirmation was present for the resected regions.",

Purpose: Specific personal identification (fingerprint or DNA matching) is strong evidence in forensic examinations but is mostly lost with decomposition. Sutures on skulls are commonly preserved. The morphology of frontonasal sutures varies among individuals and can be clearly demonstrated by three-dimensional CT (3DCT) images using a new rendering technique. Cinematic volume rendering is a new technique which improves the clarity of 3DCT images and can display skull sutures. We asked whether 3DCT images of the frontonasal suture created by the cinematic volume rendering technique can be used as specific personal identification. Methods and materials: CT images of 50 dry skulls were reformatted to 3DCT images by using a cinematic volume rendering technique on a commercially available workstation (syngo.via, version VB20). Photographs of the dry skulls were adjusted by a blurring effect on Photoshop. Four readers (an anatomist, forensic anthropologist, forensic doctor, and radiologist) responded to three questionnaires, firstly matching a 3DCT image with the photographs of dry skulls, secondly determining minimum levels of clarity of the suture on dry skull photographs that they can use for matching, and thirdly determining the level of clarity which 3DCT displayed using photographs of dry skulls as a reference.",

Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of image-guided localisation and removal of lymph nodes containing known metastases in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Methods and materials: 64 patients with breast cancer and nodal metastases who underwent NACT between 2017 and 2019 were prospectively enrolled. A clip was placed in the sampled node. After NACT, patients underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection, removal of the clipped node (CN), and subsequent axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND). Pathological results of SLN and CN were compared to ALND to assess the false-negative rate (FNR). Results: Axillary pathological complete response at ALND was 43,8%. FNR of SLN was 25%, with 9 false-negative (FN) events in 36 patients with residual disease. In 6/9 patients with FN SLNs, the CN contained metastases, resulting in an FNR of 8.3%. Basing on the number of abnormal nodes on initial staging, in patients with 1-3 abnormal nodes (21 patients) residual disease was identified in 10 patients at ALND (47,6%). The SLN didn't reveal metastases in 4/10 patients (FNR=40%) while the CN didn't reveal metastases in 1 patient (FNR=10%). In >4 abnormal nodes (43 patients), the FNRs of SLN and CN were 19,2% and 7,7%, respectively. According to radiological response to NACT, in patients with complete radiological response (cRR) (38 patients), the FNR of SLND was 35.3% (6 FN events in 17 patients with residual disease). In 4/6 patients with FN SLNs, the CN contained metastases, with an FNR of 11,7%. In patients without cRR (26 patients), the FNRs of SLN and CN were 15.8% and 5.3%, respectively. Conclusion: CN could improve accuracy of axillary staging in node-positive patients who received NACT, especially in N1-stage and in patients with cRR. Limitations: Nodal-stage on initial staging.

The aim of the study was to investigate the diagnostic capabilities of tissue-tracking (TT) strain analysis in patients with a CMR-based diagnosis of myocarditis. Methods and materials: 43 patients with a CMR-based diagnosis of myocarditis according to the standard Lake Louise criteria were retrospectively analysed. 27 healthy participants were selected as a control group. Cine-RM data was used for the analysis. Dedicated TT-software was used to perform radial, circumferential, and longitudinal strain for global, per-plane (basal, middle, and apical), and segmental (AHA 16-segments standard) evaluation in short and long-axis left ventricle images. (AUC up to 0.824) . No significant correlations were found with oedema, while a significant correlation was found between segmental radial and LE (p-value:0.019), and an interesting trend between segmental circumferential and LE (p-value:0.087). Conclusion: Tissue-tracking strain analysis has proved accurate in the evaluation of patients diagnosed with myocarditis based on standard Lake Louise criteria. Tissue-tracking strain analysis could improve diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice, adding useful information over the standard findings.",

Ethics committee approval: The study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Purpose: The pericoronary fat attenuation index (pFAI) emerged as a marker of coronary artery inflammation (CAI), measurable by standard coronary CT angiography (CCTA). It compares well with the gold standard for the CAI assessment and can predict future cardiovascular events. pFAI could prove invaluable in differentiating CAI from a noninflammatory status, helping to unravel the mechanisms subtending an event classified as myocardial infarction with nonobstructive CA (MINOCA) or Tako-Tsubo syndrome (TTS). Methods and materials: Patients admitted with MINOCA and TTS between 2011-2018, who had both CCTA and cardiac MR during/shortly after the acute phase, were selected and pFAI measured in their CCTA. pFAI was also measured in control subjects who had CCTA for atypical chest pain workup, no obstructive CAD found in their CCTA, and no cardiac events at a 2-year followup. Results: In the n=106 MINOCA/TTS, mean pFAI was 68.378.29 vs. 78.036.20 in the n=106 controls (P<0.0001), and the difference confirmed also when comparing mean pFAI in each CA between MINOCA/TTS and controls (P<0.0001). Nonobstructive coronary plaques at CCTA, high-risk plaques in particular, were more frequently found (P<0.01) in the MINOCA/TTS group versus controls. Conclusion: In MINOCA and TTS pts, CCTA is not only able to detect angiographically invisible atherosclerotic plaques, but its diagnostic yield can be expanded using the simple measurement of pFAI to characterise pericoronary fat tissue. In MINOCA/TTS, mean pFAI demonstrates higher values compared with controls, a finding that has been associated with CAI. Limitations: The drug therapy was not recorded. We cannot exclude an effect of drugs used in acute coronary syndromes on pFAI in our MINOCA/TTS group.

The CMR protocol at 1.5T included non-contrast T1-mapping using a 5(3)3 MOLLI acquisition. We analysed a mid-myocardial slice for overall and segmental myocardial T1-relaxation. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess the differences between the groups. Purpose: The diagnoses of acute myocarditis (AM) and hypertensive heart disease (HHD) remain difficult and are commonly based on a combination of clinical expertise and a multi-parameter diagnostic workup including contrastenhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). It was our purpose to evaluate a multiparametric set of native imaging parameters for their diagnostic accuracy. Methods and materials: A total of 33 AM and 21 HHD patients who had been referred to our department between 09/2014 and 09/2017, as well as 50 carefully selected healthy volunteers, (HV) underwent CMR at 3T. Subsequent featuretracking strain analysis and native T1/T2 mapping were performed and results were processed in the form of binary logistic regressions. Cut-off values, areas under the curve (AUC), and corresponding sensitivities and specificities were derived from receiver operator characteristic curves. Purpose: Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and acute myocarditis (AM) can both present with increased myocardial mass despite different pathophysiology. The differentiation between them remains difficult. The accompanying distinct patterns of altered myocardial deformation, however, can be investigated using a feature tracking (FT)-CMR strain. Hence, the aim was to evaluate whether new strain ratios including the myocardial mass per body surface area (MyoMass/BSA) yield additional value in the differentiation between both diseases and healthy volunteers. Methods and materials: Patients with AM (n=43) and HHD (n=28) underwent CMR at 3T between 09/2014 and 09/2017. A group of 61 healthy volunteers (HV) served as normal controls. FT-strain analysis was performed and natural strain values were evaluated for gender and age-specific differences. Subsequently, gender-neutral strain parameters were calculated and indexed to the MyoMass/BSA, leading to ratio strains. These were then evaluated for their discriminatory accuracy by means of areas under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Results: There were statistically significant differences in strains between genders (p<0.05) but not between age groups. For the differentiation between HV and AM, the global circumferential strain ratio performed best (AUC 0.86, 79% sensitivity, and 82% specificity). In discriminating between HV and HHD, as well as AM and HHD, the global longitudinal strain ratio outperformed all other parameters (AUCs 0.96/0.79, 92%/89% sensitivity, and 86%/66% specificity, respectively).",

Conclusion: Images on the sagittal plane may contribute to a morphological analysis for PtA in parathyroid MRI and oblonged morphology with reverse D appearance may facilitate the diagnosis. Purpose: Visualisation of peroneal vessels prior to autologous transplantation of osteomyocutaneous fibular flap for mandibular reconstruction is essential for surgical success. Our aim was to improve and simplify the pre-surgical diagnostics of peroneal perforators using a dedicated dual-energy CTA protocol and semiautomatic vessel unfolding algorithm. Methods and materials: CTA of the lower limbs was performed in 20 patients using dual-energy acquisitions from a third-generation dual-source CT and a high iodine flux (7mL/s, 350 mg/mL). Monoenergetic reconstructions (40 keV) were automatically reconstructed from the scanner and used for the semiautomatic centreline labelling of the peroneal arteries and their lateral perforators on a post-processing console using a dedicated vascular workflow. Curved MIP reconstruction was regarded as a gold standard. Vessel unfolding reconstruction was performed using a prototype software application. Number and length of perforator arteries were compared between curved MIP reconstruction, thin slice MIP in coronal orientation, posterior VRT, and coronal vessel unfolding of each lower limb. Results: The vessel unfolding algorithm was applicable in all patients and significantly more perforator arteries could be detected compared to thin slice MIP and VRT reconstructions. The mean perforator length was only 7% shorter than in the gold standard, whereas values from thin slice MIP and VRT were significantly shorter. Bone superposition was less frequent in vessel unfolding compared to thin slice MIP. Conclusion: The combination of low monoenergetic reconstructions and vessel unfolding allows for a comprehensive and precise presentation of small peroneal perforator vessels prior to autologous transplantation. Purpose: Non-static metal implants like pacemakers frequently lead to heavy streak-shaped artefacts in reconstructed CT image volumes. The reliable evaluation of neighbouring anatomy, for instance with regard to inflammation or calcification, might thereby be limited. Furthermore, motion precludes application of standard second pass metal artefact reduction (MAR) methods, which implicitly assume a static object during CT acquisition. We propose a MAR pipeline which is robust regarding motion and applicable on a wide range of scanner types, acquisition modes, and contrast protocols.",

MRI protocols were as follows: T1WI, T2WI, DWI (TR/TE=7000/62 ms; b=0, 1000 sec/mm2), and DCE-MRI performed on 3.0 Tesla scanner (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) with 18 or 16 channel dedicated breast coils. The MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists with 20 and 3 years experience of breast MRI, and the target lesions were given a 3-point score . The RECIST-based evaluation was further classified into 3 groups (PD, SD, PR/near CR/CR). Pathological evaluation: pCR was defined as no residual invasive or noninvasive cancer in breast tissue on histopathology from surgical resection (in situ lesion was allowed). Statistical analysis was performed with MedCalc. The diagnostic performance of DWI parameters in discriminating pCR was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. For RECIST-based criteria, they were grouped as pCR or non-pCR. Results: Among 116 cases, 40.5% (47/116) achieved pCR while 59.5% (69/116) were categorised as non-pCR on pathology. The DWI score was strongly associated with residual disease",

Subsequently, FBP-images were postprocessed using PixelShine (B30f-PS, PixelShine version 1.2.104, sharpening level 2, noise level 14, processing strength A8, soft kernel settings). CT numbers (mean and standard deviation (noise)) in 6 ROIs (background, paravertebral muscle, fat, spleen, liver, and bladder) and subjective image quality were compared for the different datasets. Results: Image noise reduced significantly for B30f-PS-datasets compared to B30f-and I30f-datasets (-38 to -50% and -12 to -30% for soft tissues, respectively). CT numbers in liver, spleen, bladder, and fat were constant for all datasets, whereas significant differences were notable for background (B30f-PS vs B30f, and B30f vs I30f) and muscle (B30f-PS vs B30f, and B30f-PS vs I30f). In general, PixelShine improved image quality of B30f datasets considerably. Compared to I30f datasets, liver tissue looked more homogeneous, confirming a lower noise level. Beam-hardening artefacts were neither reduced nor enhanced. Conclusion: PixelShine reduces noise while maintaining image information with its deep learning algorithm. Especially for older CT scanners, where IR is not available, PixelShine allows to increase image quality. For new scanners, PixelShine allows to reduce patient dose while maintaining image quality.

Arrigoni, M. Di Luzio, S. Mascaretti, G. Mascaretti, C. Masciocchi; L'Aquila/IT (luciavazzana@gmail.com) Purpose: To demonstrate that a careful selection of patients is important to predict the execution of treatment and a good result. Methods and materials: 228 women with uterine fibroids were submitted to c.e. MRI to evaluate the possibility of MRgFUS treatment. The ablation results were evaluated by the non-perfused volume (NPV) on contrast-enhanced MR images acquired after the treatment. Results: 115 women out of 228 (50.4%) were considered suitable for treatment (good MRI features of the dominant fibroids and adequate acoustic window); 15 of them obtained an incomplete result and other treatments (a second MRgFUS, uterine artery embolisation (UAE), or surgery). The mean value of the NPV ratio was 67.4%, assessed immediately after the treatment. 113 patients out of 228 were not eligible for the treatment: 8/113 women had an abdominal scar, 39/113 patients showed interposition bowel, reverse uterine position, or inadequate acoustic window, and 66/113 had inappropriate features of the fibroids such as number, side (i.e. pedunculate position), big size, or high vascularisation. Conclusion: MRgFUS is a mini-invasive treatment and it is well tolerated by patients. A correct selection is necessary to achieve a risk-free treatment and good clinical results. Limitations: The radiological evaluation according to criteria in the literature for the MRgFUS treatment. Ethics committee approval: n/a Funding: No funding was received for this work.",

RTEart showed a significant difference between intermediate and high-grade PDAC (-0.52\u00b10.23 vs -0.67\u00b10.19, p<0.05). We identified different radiomics features that best correlated with the PDAC grade (MPP, kurtosis, SSF etc). The diagnostic performance of joint CE-MDCT features with radiomics signature increased compared with CE_MDCT features alone (sensitivity 97.3 vs 91.3%, specificity 84.1 vs 80%). Conclusion: The analysis of radiomics features and DCE features is useful for PDAC grade prediction.Limitations:The study was single-centred with standardised CE-MDCT protocols.

Conclusion: In patients with locally advanced and metastatic PC, the high RML between the first and second CT is associated with worse survival and earlier tumour progression. The RML from baseline to the first follow-up CT in patients receiving FOLFIRINOX may add value to response prediction in PC and help with therapy modulation or nutritional intervention.

Methods and materials: Thirty patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between June 2015 and April 2018 were included in the study. The intraductal component and cribriform pattern of each tumour focus were also identified with whole-mount histopathologic analysis correlation. Results: The presence of intraductal component did not create a statistically significant difference in visibility of the index tumour on MRI and PET. However, in terms of total tumoral lesions, the visibility on MRI is statistically significant. The presence of cribriform pattern did not show a statistically significant difference in detection of the tumour on MRI and PET. Conclusion: Cribriform pattern was found to be less visible than intraductal carcinoma by MRI.Limitations: Our study was retrospective. It has a limited number of patients.

Gicovate; Jerusalem/IL (dgicovate@yahoo.com)Purpose: To research possible future directions for AI technology in radiology. We analyse the suitability of a hypothetical \"super AI\" technology capable of integrating multiple studies simultaneously. Additionally, we compare super AI with the possibility of developing a multi-modality-scanner (\"supermodality\"). Methods and materials: Super AI: combining AI packages will be possible to get better disease diagnosis. We analysed some factors to develop such technology: A) The time factor between different studies. B) The patient position. C) Modality technology. D) The radiologist as an integrator of knowledge. E) The contrast agent. Supermodality: multimodality machines developed are the PET-MRI. PET-CT, CT-ultrasound-registration, etc, are common hospital practices. What about a single machine that can scan using different technologies? Will it reduce the time to diagnose? Results: Those new machines will suppose a completely new paradigm and new radiologist knowledge, and new contrast agents, may be needed. Conclusion: Different AI packages can discover different findings in different kinds of studies. Combining modalities or combining AI packages will substantially improve diagnosis. Two different strategies can be adapted to produce a more complete diagnosis in a multi-exam scenario: 1) To develop a super AI system, as a software solution, capable of analysing and integrating the data of different AI packages 2) To develop a new generation of machines: a super modality that scans the patient using several technologies at the same time (CT + MRI + ultrasound + etc.) and reducing patient positioning, time differences, contrast agents factors, and others. Limitations: Both kinds of technologies do not exist today. Even if the software solution (super AI) is the easy one, and probably the most possible to develop in the next few years, a mix of the two strategies will be the only way to reach the next level of radiology.

Mantilla 2 ;Purpose: In transplant rejection, there is an increase in venous flow velocities and a decrease in arterial flow velocities, probably due to graft hardening. Methods and materials: A diagnostic study was carried out between January 2014 and May 2018. Renal transplanted patients who underwent percutaneous renal biopsy were studied. The veno-arterial index (VAI) was obtained by measuring the flow velocity in the segmental vein at the level of the renal medulla (VFV) and dividing this value by the velocity of the systolic peak of the segmental artery (PSV) in this same location. Results: 78 records of patients who underwent renal biopsy were analysed. 32 patients (41.5%) suffered from transplant rejection, with 29 presenting with acute rejection. Prior to the study, a normal baseline value of the VAI was obtained by measuring the VAI in 70 individuals without known urological pathology, obtaining a VAI with a median value of 0.30 (range 0.18-0.44). In transplant rejection, the median VAI was 0.67. In kidneys with a negative biopsy for rejection, the median VAI was 0.41 (p=0.007), higher than that obtained for the general population which was 0.30 (p=0.0001). In subacute and acute rejection, the index was higher (VAI: 0.725). For the severity of rejection, the difference was also statistically significant (p = 0.0001).Conclusion:The results of this study show that the veno-arterial index (VAI) is a useful parameter which could predict transplant rejection when elevated. Limitations: Studies with a larger number of patients are required to confirm this hypothesis and to obtain a more accurate value of the VAI.

Galatola, A. Stanzione, F. Verde, V. Romeo, R. Liuzzi, P. P. Mainenti, E. Guadagno, A. Brunetti, S. Maurea; Naples/IT (galatolaroberta@gmail.com)Purpose: To assess the significance of a qualitative heterogeneous pattern of signal drop on chemical shift (CS) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of adrenal lesions (AL) employing quantitative parameters obtained from CS and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences. Methods and materials: This retrospective study included 3T MRI examinations with AL, for which histopathology, functional imaging, or follow-up data were available as a reference standard. Two radiologists qualitatively grouped AL on CS sequences, showing homogeneous (group A), heterogeneous (group B), and no (group C) signal drop. They manually drew 2D ROIs on CS and DCE images to obtain three quantitative parameters: adrenal signal intensity index (ASII), absolute (AWO), and relative washout (RWO). ANOVA analysis and a post-hoc Dunn's test were used to compare these values among the three groups. Results: 66 AL were included, divided into groups A (n=19), B (n=23), and C (n=24). ASII values resulted as significantly different among the three groups (p<0.001) with the following median values: 71%, 53%, and 0.03%, respectively. AWO and RWO values were not significantly different between groups A and B, showing percentages (AWO: 54% and 46% and RWO: 33% and 29%, respectively) suggestive of a benign nature. Indeed, 98% of lesions were benign, mostly (86%) represented by adenomas. Conversely, AWO and RWO values of group C resulted as significantly different (p<0.001) and lower (20% and 9%, respectively) than other groups. Indeed, 58% of these lesions were nonadenomas and the remaining percentage were lipid-poor adenomas. Conclusion: According to our results, AL showing a qualitative heterogeneous pattern of signal drop on CS images are mainly benign and represented by adenomas, showing dynamic quantitative parameters similar to those with a homogeneous signal drop on CS sequence.

Yal\u00e7\u0131n, A. A. Demir, Y. Savas; Istanbul/TR (mdalpersever@gmail.com) Purpose: To investigate the role of diffusion-weighted imaging in the characterisation of renal masses. Methods and materials: Between January 2014 and December 2018, patients who had a histopathologically-proven renal tumour were reviewed retrospectively. Patients who had preoperative MRIs were included for the study. Diffusion-weighted images were taken and ADC maps were calculated automatically by the MRI unit. The average ADC values of masses were measured. SPSS was used to evaluate the statistical data. Results: Of the 142 patients, 108 had malignant masses and 34 had benign masses. Of the malignant patients, 59 had clear-cell RCC, 19 had papillary RCC, 14 had chromophobe RCC, 9 had TCC, and 7 had other rare subtypes. Of the benign patients, 6 had oncocytoma, 3 had angiomyolipoma, and 14 had papillary adenomas, metanephric adenomas, and infectious pseudotumours. 11 had benign cystic lesions of the kidneys. The difference between ADC values of malignant and benign masses wasn't statistically significant (0.92 vs 0.88 \u00d7 10 -3 mm 2 /s; p>0.05). Clear-cell RCCs had higher ADC values than non-clear-cell RCCs (1.09 vs 0.73 \u00d7 10 -3 mm 2 /s; p<0.05). RCCs had higher ADC values than non-RCCs (0.96 vs 0.69 \u00d7 10 -3 mm 2 /s; p<0.05). Oncocytomas had higher ADC values than chromofobe RCCs (1.27 vs 0.73 \u00d7 10 -3 mm 2 /s; p<0.05). The difference between low-grade RCCs (Fuhrman grade 1-2) and high-grade RCCs (Fuhrman grade 3-4) was statistically significant. Low-grade RCCs had higher ADC values (1.06 vs 0.9 \u00d7 10 -3 mm 2 /s; p<0.05). Conclusion: ADC measurements may help in the differentiation of certain renal masses. It should be encouraged to be used in appropriate situations. Limitations: The retrospective nature of the study.

L. Marcolin, L. M. Cacioppa, M. Ruggeri, G. Scalas, N. Sciascia, I. Capelli, R. Golfieri, G. La Manna; 1 Bologna/IT (laura.cacioppa@gmail.com)Purpose: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterised by a progressive enlargement of kidney cysts, often leading to end-stage disease with the need for renal transplantation (RT) and native kidney nephrectomy (NN). Few studies have investigated the appropriate timing for NN and the role of the change in total kidney volume (TKV) after RT in NN indications. Methods and materials: From January 2008 to December 2018, all polycystic patients who underwent RT in our centre were recorded and retrospectively reviewed. TKVs were evaluated with volumetric analyses on computed tomography (CT) scans performed before and one year after RT in patients who underwent RT alone, and in those scheduled for RT who also required NN. Mean TKV values were height/age, adjusted according to imaging classification of ADPKD (hTKV) and compared. Results: A total of 182 RTs were collected; 50 patients (27.5%) underwent NN (29 bilateral and 21 unilateral). NN procedures were pre-RT, post-RT, and simultaneous to RT in 54 (76%), 11 (15.5%), and 6 (8.5%), respectively; 34 (47.9%) due to symptoms occurrence and 37 (52.1%) to allow graft positioning. The median age was 54,6 \u00b1 8,7. The mean hTKVs showed a non significant post-RT reduction in the group submitted to RT alone (1866.1\u00b11005.2 vs 1863.2\u00b11075.4 ml/m;p=ns). Compared to those submitted to RT alone, patients who underwent NN showed a higher mean pre-RT hTKV (2301.7\u00b11100.7 vs 1651\u00b1994.3 ml/m;p=0.1). Conclusion: Despite the natural course of native polycystic kidneys, after RT is not well known and indications and timing of NN in patients scheduled for RT are controversial. Our study showed how TKV could be a measurable tool to determine critical kidney volumes at risk of complication and requiring future NN. Decisions for or against NN should take into account TKV reduction after RT and the presence of symptoms, complications, or unavailable graft space in order to avoid additive risks.

Baltzer; Vienna/AT (jasmingmeiner@yahoo.de)Purpose: To investigate the diagnostic performance of the overall VI-RADS score and its individual parameters in assessing muscle invasivness and grade of bladder cancer (BCa).Methods and materials:In this IRB-approved, prospective single-centre crosssectional observational study, patients with BCa underwent preoperative multiparametric MRI at 3T including T2w, DWI, and DCE images. Evaluation according to the VI-RADS scoring system was performed by two radiologists independently, blinded to histological findings. The performance of mpMRI and VI-RADS for determining muscle invasiveness and grade of BCa was compared by using ROC analysis. Results: The median age of 45 included patients was 67.6, range 28-90 years. Among 45 BCa, 13 (29%) were identified as muscle-invasive and 32 (71%) as non-invasive BCa. The AUC for VI-RADS to predict muscle invasion was 0.975 (95% CI: 0.877 to 0.999) and 0.866 for VI-RADS to distinguish high-grade from low-grade BCa (95% CI 0.728 to 0.951). There was no significant difference between the AUC of single parameters (DCE, T2w and DWI) compared to the total VI-RADS score (p=1.000, p=0.408, p=0.264 for muscle invasion; p=1.000, p=0.2644, p=0.828 for grading).Conclusion:Our results indicate that VI-RADS is an effective clinical decision rule to diagnose BCa grading and invasiveness. The inclusion of multiple parameters does not seem to be necessary. Therefore, contrast-enhanced sequences may be omitted as BCa patients regularly suffer from renal insufficiency. Limitations: Besides a small sample size, the main limitation of this study is the observational character that did not investigate the effect of VI-RADS on clinical decision making.

Fierro, M. Pecoraro, S. Cipollari, R. Campa, V. Salvo, C. Catalano, V. Panebianco; Rome/IT (fierrodavide852@hotmail.com)Purpose: To determine whether the association of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences + T2-weighted 3D CUBE to the standard mpMRI protocol could aid in differentiating muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) from non-muscleinvasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Methods and materials: 61 patients were enrolled and underwent mpMRI before tumour resection. Exams were performed on a 3T scanner (GE Discovery 750) with a 32 channel BodyCoil, DTI sequences (matrix 100x100, TR:3485, TE:55, Auto InvTime:248, thickness (thk): 3.0 mm, gap: 0.5 mm, field of view (FOV) 26, b value: 0 (2 NEX), 1,000 (4 NEX), 16 directions) and T2-weighted (CUBE) 3D isotropic (matrix: 260x260, TR: Auto, TE:120, thl: 1.4 mm, FOV 26, echo-train-length (ETL):100) were acquired and reconstructed with WorkStation (FiberTrack program, GE, ADW 4.7). Two radiologists reported the exams, blinded to pathology results. Accuracy was determined using histopathology as a reference standard. Results: A total of 61 exams were analysed. All NMIBC (n=41) lesions were correctly defined by the DTI + T2-weighted 3D CUBE image set. Overall accuracy of the setting protocol completed by FiberTrack and MultiPlanar reconstructions was 90% to differentiate NMIBC from MIBC. Conclusion: Association of DTI + T2-weighted 3D CUBE sequences on MpMRI appears to be a reliable staging tool for bladder cancer. With further validation, mpMRI + DTI sequences + T2-weighted 3D CUBE could precede cystoscopic resection, allowing for prompt detection of muscle invasiveness fastening therapeutic pathways.Limitations: A small sample size in a single institution.

Cao, B. He, X. Luo, X. Sun; Zibo/CN (cjf19810629@163.com)Purpose: To evaluate the role of diffusion kurtosis imaging in the characterisation of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma compared with standard diffusion-weighted imaging. Methods and materials: 80 patients with histologically proven ccRCC were evaluated by DKI and DWI on a 3-T scanner. All ccRCCs were classified as grade 1 (n=15), grade 2 (n=22), grade 3 (n=24), and grade 4 (n=19) according to the Fuhrman classification system. Regions of interest were drawn on the maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusion coefficient, mean diffusion kurtosis, axial kurtosis, and radial kurtosis. The differences in DWI and DKI parameters were evaluated and a receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. Results: ADC value could be used to discriminate G1 vs G3, G1 vs G4, G2 vs G3, G2 vs G4, and G3 vs G4 (P <0.05), except for G1 vs G2. All the DKI parameters except for FA could be used to discriminate G1 vs G2, G1 vs G3, G1 vs G4, G2 vs G4, and G3 vs G4 (P <0.05), whereas MD, MK, and Kr could discriminate G2 vs G3 (P <0.05). Moreover, ROC analysis showed that the MK values exhibited the best performance. Conclusion: DKI could provide better performance than conventional DWI in grading ccRCC. Limitations: The number of ccRCC patients was relatively small. When the lesion is small or there is an unresolved necrotic area in the lesion, the ROI fails to completely avoid the necrotic tissue in the lesion and the results may be biased.

Rouviere; Lyon/FR (olivier.rouviere@netcourrier.com) Purpose: To develop technical guidelines for magnetic resonance imaging aimed at characterising renal masses (multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and mpMRI) and the bladder and the upper urinary tract (magnetic resonance urography and MRU). Methods and materials: The French Society of Genitourinary organised a Delphi consensus conference with a two-round Delphi survey followed by a faceto-face meeting. Two separate questionnaires were issued for renal mpMRI and for MRU. Consensus was strictly defined using a priori criteria. Results: 42 expert uro-radiologists completed both survey rounds with no attrition between the rounds. 56/84 (66.7%) statements of the mpMRI questionnaire and 44/71 (62%) statements of the MRU questionnaire reached a final consensus. For mpMRI, there was consensus that no injection of furosemide was needed and that the imaging protocol should include T2weighted imaging, dual-chemical shift imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (use of multiple b-values; maximal b-value: 1000 s/mm\u00b2) and fat-saturated singlebolus multiphase (unenhanced, corticomedullary, nephrographic) contrastenhanced imaging; late imaging (more than 10 minutes after injection) was judged as optional. For MRU, the patients should void their bladder before the examination. The protocol must include T2-weighted imaging, anatomical fast T1/T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (use of multiple b-values; maximal b-value: 1000 s/mm\u00b2), and fat-saturated single-bolus multiphase (unenhanced, corticomedullary, nephrographic, excretory) contrast-enhanced imaging. An intravenous injection of furosemide is mandatory before the injection of contrast medium. Heavily T2-weighted cholangiopancreatography-like imaging was judged optional. to standardise magnetic resonance imaging of kidneys, ureter, and bladder. Limitations: Consensus statements represent a low level of evidence. The consensus conference did not address MR examinations aimed at evaluating bladder cancer local staging, nor protocol variations in children or pregnant women.Ethics committee approval: n/a Funding: This work was funded by the French Society of Genitourinary Imaging (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise d'Imagerie G\u00e9nito-urinaire) Author Disclosures: O.

Panebianco; Rome/IT(pecoraro.martina1@gmail.com)    Purpose: To prospective validate VI-RADS in NMI-and-MIBC discrimination at TURBT. To identify HR-NMIBCs who could avoid Re-TURBT and to detect those at a higher risk for under-staging after TURBT. Methods and materials: Patients with a BCa suspicion were offered multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) before TURBT. According to VI-RADS, a cutoff \u22653 to define MIBC was assumed. TURBT reports were compared with preoperative VI-RADS scores to assess the accuracy of mpMRI in discriminating NMI-and-MIBC. HR-NMIBCs Re-TURBT reports were compared with preoperatively recorded VI-RADS scores to assess mpMRI accuracy in predicting Re-TURBT outcomes. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive (PPV, NPV) values were calculated for mpMRI performance in patients undergoing TURBT and for HR-NMIBCs candidate for Re-TURBT. ROC curve and K statistics were calculated Results: 231 patients were enrolled. MpMRI showed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV in discriminating NMI-from-MIBC at initial TURBT of 91.9% VI-RADS is accurate for discriminating NMI-and-MIBC. Within HR-NMIBCs, VI-RADS could improve the selection of patients' candidate for Re-TURBT in the future. Limitations: MpMRI cannot yet be adopted for CIS and the sample is small in a single-centre.

Rahota 1 , P. Medan 2 , B. Petresc 3 , A. Tamas-Szora 2 , R. Rahota 1 , N. Crisan 2 , A. Lebovici 2 ; 1 Oradea/RO, 2 Cluj/RO, 3 Tg. Mures/RO Purpose: To determine whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measured from diffusion-weighted imaging reflects quantitative information of the histological grading and clinical aggressiveness of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Methods and materials: We prospectively enrolled 25 bladder tumours that have undergone 1.5T MRI DW images using b-values of 0, 50, and 800 s/mm2 in axial and sagittal planes. ADC values and their relationship with histological factors were measured for each lesion. The pathology report was considered a gold standard diagnosis. Results: 14 lesions were low grade (LG) and 11 high grade (HG). 11 lesions were staged as pTa and 14 as pT1. The mean ADCs of LG and HG tumours were 1.25 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/s, respectively, 0.80 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/s, with a difference that was statistically significant (p<0.001). The cut-off value in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for differentiating LG and HG according to ADC values was 0.87 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/s (Se=72.7%, Sp=100%), with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.90. The mean values of ADC of pTa and pT1 tumours were 1.24 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/s and 0.80 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/s, respectively (p<0.001). No significant difference was found among the values of ADCs of axial versus sagittal acquisitions for tumours located on the lateral walls (1.12 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2 /s vs. 1.21 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/s, p=0.56), or for tumours located on the inferior and superior walls (1.15 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/s vs 1.08 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/s, p=0.56). Conclusion: DW imaging with ADC measurement could become a novel noninvasive method for predicting tumour aggressiveness in bladder cancer. Limitations: A preliminary study and small sample size.

A. Garza Rico, R. A. Cu\u00e9llar Lozano, R. Pinales Razo, N. G. Jasso Ramirez; Monterrey/MX (dra.ingridgarza@gmail.com)    Purpose: To measure the volume and measurements of the maxillary, sphenoid and frontal sinuses and in healthy Mexican patients, using computed tomography (CT) scans. Methods and materials: A retrospective, case series study in a single academic centre, CT scans of 210 subjects, 10 of every age, between 0 and 20 years of age, performed between January 2016 and November 2017 in the Hospital Universitario of Monterrey, Mexico. A comparative analysis of the volume and dimensions of the paranasal sinuses was performed using multiplanar reformating and volume rendering with segmentation. Patients with prior history of trauma, surgery, and pathology of the paranasal sinuses were excluded. The study population was subdivided by gender and age. Results: A total of 210 CT scans were analysed, 104 (49.5%) males and 106 (50.5%) females. The groups were subdivided by age (<5, 6-10, 11-15 and >16 years). The largest volumes were reached by 16 to 20 years of age. In the 6-10 age group, the females had larger volumes than the males. The males had a tendency to present larger volumes in general. There is a high correlation in between the volume of sinus and its contralateral r (0.01) and there is also a significant relation of the sinus volume and age Z (<0.004). Conclusion: There is a clear volumetric correlation according to age and gender, there is a direct relation between a sinus and its contralateral homologous. The expected volume development can influence clinical decision making in this age group. Limitations: The normal variants of the paranasal sinuss were not part of the study design.

Megahed; Cairo/EG (bosi_123@hotmail.com)Purpose: To assess the role of MRI in the assessment of patients suffering from temporomandibular joint pain presented to the El-Demerdash Hospital. Methods and materials: A cross-sectional study is done on 50 patients presented to El-Demerdash hospital presented by temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain. MRI was done on our 1.5 T machine with the following conventional sequences: axial T1 images sagittal oblique images, oriented along the long axis of the mandible, acquired at closed and open mouth positions, obtained with a fast-spin echo, a PD, and a T2* gradient echo technique. Coronal thin sections of \u22643 mm T2 sequences. Image interpretation was done commenting upon the articular surfaces, articular disc position and morphology, joint space, lateral pterygoid muscle as well as bony abnormalities. Results: 64% of the cases had TMJ pain due to disc displacement. 18% of the cases had TMJ pain due to arthritis. 6% of the cases had TMJ pain due to fracture. 6% of the cases had TMJ pain due to infection. 4% of the cases had TMJ pain due to tumour. 2% of the cases had TMJ pain due to lateral pterygoid muscle abnormality Conclusion: MRI is the technique of choice for assessing patients presented with TMJ pain identifying its different pathologies. Having a systemic pattern in image interpretation is important for the radiologist to detect early signs of TMJ dysfunction, thereby avoiding its progression to an irreversible phase. Limitations: The study was done on a small number of patients. The positioning of the patient during the imaging was limited due to severe pain and limited openmouth view.

Megahed: nothing to disclose Normal thyroid stiffness in healthy adults using real-time shear wave and strain elastography and factors that influence the measurement of stiffness M. Z. Mohammad Zakir 1 , P. Chatterjee 2 , R. Ravikumar 3 ; 1 Nagpur/IN,Purpose:Elastography is a non-invasive technique to determine tissue stiffness. Elastography estimation is of two types qualitative (compression) and quantitative (shear wave or ARFI) method. The aim of this study is to define a normal range of thyroid stiffness in healthy individuals using the above methods. Also, our objective is to determine various factors affecting in determining the elastography values. Methods and materials: In our study 812 healthy subjects underwent the examination of the stiffness of the thyroid gland and various factors like age, gender, position during the test, BMI, size of ROI, depth of ROI etc which affect the stiffness measurement were studied. In the strain elastography (compression) the red colour coding was taken as stiffer areas and blue as normal tissue; green was intermediate tissue type. Results: The mean value of ARFI (shear wave or quantitative) in the 812 subjects were 1.32 +/-0.55 m/s. In the strain elastography (compression) all subjects' thyroid gland demonstrated blue colour coding representing normal parenchyma. The stiffness was found more in the elderly and with higher BMI subjects. The values were more consistent when measured in the mid-segment of the lobe of the thyroid gland. The values were slightly higher in female subjects. The size and depth of ROI do not affect the measurement. Conclusion: The sonoelastography of the thyroid gland is an important noninvasive tool to assess the stiffness of thyroid gland in pathological conditions. The factors which affect the elastography measurement should be avoided or considered while measuring the elastography values. Elastography is a noninvasive technique to assess the tissue stiffness and to differentiate normal and abnormal areas in the tissue. Limitations: The single-centre study design limited this study.

Rao 3 ; 1 Calicut/IN, 2 Chandigarh/IN, 3 Detroit, MI/US (DRTHANSEER@GMAIL.COM)Purpose: This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of ultrasonography of the neck, 99m Tc-sestamibi and 18 F-fluorocholine PET/CT imaging in the preoperative localisation of parathyroid lesions in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Methods and materials: Fifty-four patients of PHPT were included in this prospective study who underwent preoperative localisation of the parathyroid lesion(s) using three diagnostic modalities followed by surgery. The sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and accuracy of the three imaging procedures to accurately detect abnormal parathyroid glands were determined using histopathology as the gold standard. Results: FCH PET/CT detected 52 out of 54 patients and 52 out of 56 lesions with histopathologically proven parathyroid adenomas on patient-based and lesion-based analysis respectively. Preoperative USG, MIBI and FCH PET/CT localised abnormal parathyroid gland(s) in 39 (72.2%), 43 (79.6%) and 54 (100%) patients respectively. The sensitivity and PPV were 69.3% and 87.1% for USG, 80.7% and 97.6% for MIBI, and 100% and 96.3% for FCH PET/CT. The accuracy was 62.9%, 79.6% and 96.3% for USG, MIBI and FCH PET/CT respectively in the patient-wise analysis. In six patients with ectopic lesions, FCH PET/CT demonstrated higher sensitivity and accuracy than MIBI and USG (100% vs 66.6% and 16.7% respectively). Conclusion: Among the three imaging techniques tested simultaneously, FCH PET/CT was superior for accurate preoperative localisation of parathyroid adenomas, especially for ectopic or small parathyroid lesions. Limitations: Various statistical measures like specificity, negative predictive value and serum PTH cut off values for FCH PET/CT could not be calculated in our study, as none of the patients was negative on FCH PET/CT imaging.

Ashour, H. A. K. Abdel Hameed, Z. M. Abdel Hafeez, A. S. Abdelrahman; Cairo/EG (manar.ashour@gmail.com)Purpose: To assess the diagnostic performance of the ACR NI-RADS. Methods and materials: 116 follow-up scans for 55 patients treated from primary HNSCC were included in combined retrospective and prospective study that was conducted in Ain-Shams University Hospitals. Scans timings followed our institution protocol; the first follow-up performed eight weeks after finishing treatment. A choice between CE-CT/MRI or PET-CT determined by the clinical scenario. Scans were reported using the ACR NI-RADS template, scores were assigned to each scan; one for the primary tumour site and one for neck nodes. The assigned NI-RADS scores were correlated to patients' outcomes according to our gold standard: tissue pathological examination and/ or follow-up scans, with follow-up duration that extended for twelve months, except for two patients. We calculated the rate of disease recurrence for each score. We compared the diagnostic performance of the different NI-RADS templates for CE-CT; PET-CT and CE-MRI. We also assessed the diagnostic performance of the templates' imaging findings describing the primary tumor site morphological changes, enhancement, and FDG activity, and describing the neck nodes correlated to outcome. Data analysis was done by IBM SPSS (V.25.0, IBM Crop., USA, 2017-2018). Results: We had 232 targets for primary tumour sites and for lymph nodes. Tumour recurrence occurred in 53 targets. Recurrence rates for each NI-RADS category. A significant correlation between template morphological and enhancement findings and patients' outcomes at the primary site and LNs. PET/CT template had the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Conclusion: The performance of the ACR NI-RADS reporting system is excellent with a good correlation with the outcome.

S. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, E. Ertekin; Aydin/TR (md.suhaozturk@gmail.com)Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential diagnostic value of point shear wave elastography (pSWE) and the contribution of concurrent diffusion-weighted MRI to diagnostic performance prospectively in patients with cervical lymphadenopathy. Methods and materials: 188 cervical lymph nodes of 144 patients were included in the study. All patients with or without an underlying malignancy were included in the study and all lymph nodes were evaluated before the treatment or histopathological sampling. US characteristics were recorded, stiffness and ADC values of lymph nodes were measured. Lymph nodes were divided into benign and malign groups with histopathological findings, clinical and sonographic follow-up. Results: Short axis, hilus morphology, vascularisation patterns, pSWE, and ADC values were significant parameters in logistic regression tests between the two groups. The median stiffness of malign nodes were higher and the average ADC values were lower than others also the lowest ADC values were measured in lymphoproliferative disorders (p<0.001). Area under the curve values for pSWE and diffusion MRI were 0.846 (95% CI, 0.789-0.903), 0.796 (95% CI, 0.725-0.868), respectively. Tissue stiffness had the highest diagnostic accuracy with 80.3%. Accuracy rate increased to 87.2% from 83.5% when the pSWE was combined with the conventional US. No differences were detected when the DWI findings were added to these. Conclusion: The use of pSWE combined with B-mode US may be sufficient for the differentiation of lymph nodes and will reduce the number of biopsies. The main role of DWI in cases which underwent ultrasonography, may be specific to lymphoproliferative disorders rather than lymph node characterisation. Limitations: Study group was heterogeneous and not all cases had pathological evaluation. Ethics committee approval: The ethics committee approval and written informed consent were obtained.

Lebda 2 ; 1 Kafr El-Shaikh/EG, Zagazig/EG (emademara85@yahoo.com)Purpose: To evaluate the role of apparent diffusion coefficient values in differentiating between malignant and benign solitary thyroid nodules and its correlation with histopathological results as the reference standard. Methods and materials: 30 patients with solitary thyroid nodules were included and evaluated by ultrasound, colour Doppler ultrasound, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI-MR) using b-values (500, 1000 mm 2 /s) with ADC value measurement. Fine needle aspiration was done after DW-MRI to avoid affecting diffusion characters of the nodules. Histopathological examinations were done for all cases after surgery and correlated with the imaging finding. Results: 24 nodules were benign (12 adenomatous hyperplasias, nine follicular hyperplasias, and three solitary nodular goiters) and six nodules were malignant (three papillary carcinoma and three follicular carcinoma). The mean ADC value of benign thyroid nodules (2.1\u00b1 0.2\u00d7 10\u22123 mm 2 /s -1.87\u00b1 0.3\u00d7 10\u22123 mm 2 /s) was statistical significance higher than malignant ones ( 1.06\u00b1 0.2\u00d7 10\u22123 mm 2 /s -0.970.3\u00d7 10\u22123 mm 2 /s) using b-values 500, 1000 mm 2 /s (P=0.001 and 0.001) respectively. The mean ADC value of benign and malignant nodules done using b-values 1000 mm 2 /s was statistical significance higher than using b-values 500 mm 2 /s (P=0001). A cut-off ADC value of (1.5) has been suggested as a reference point to differentiate benign from malignant nodules with (83.3 % sensitivity, 96.0% specificity, 83.3 % PPV and 96.02% NPV, P=.001) using b-values 500 mm 2 /s and (100 % sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV and 100% NPV, P=.001) using b-values 1000 mm 2 /s.Conclusion: ADC value calculation is a good quantitative measurement that can differentiate benign from malignant solitary thyroid nodules with recommendable b-value 1000 mm2/s. Limitations: This study is limited by the motion artefact, a small number of patients and difficult to detect nodules < 5mm.

Wang 2 ; 1 Wuxi/CN, 2 Zhenjiang/CN (hsd2001054@163.com)Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of preoperative ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the prediction of extrathyroidal extension (ETE) in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and to compare the diagnostic performances of US and MRI for predicting ETE.Methods and materials:This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board. Preoperative US and MRI were performed for 225 patients who underwent surgery for PTCs between May 2014 and December 2018. For each case, the US and MRI features of ETE were retrospectively and independently investigated by two radiologists. The diagnostic performance of US and MRI, including their sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for ETE, as well as their accuracy in predicting ETE was analysed. Results: US showed higher sensitivity and NPV than MRI in the prediction of minimal ETE (87.5 vs 71.3, p=0.006 and 76.2 vs 61.7 p=0.046, respectively). MRI showed higher sensitivity than US for assessing extensive ETE (85.4 vs 66.7, p=0.005). The specificity and PPV of MRI were significantly higher than those of US (p=0.025 and p=0.025, respectively) for assessing overall ETE. Conclusion: Preoperative US should be used as the first line of predicting minimal ETE and MRI should be added to assess assessing extensive ETE. Compared with US, MRI has higher specificity and PPV in detecting overall ETE of PTC. Limitations: Selection bias may have existed.

Bayer 3 ; 1 Erlangen/DE, 2 Rostock/DE, 3 Bamberg/DE (Rafael.Heiss@uk-erlangen.de)Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and to compare image quality and diagnostic performance of 3T and 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols for the direct depiction of finger pulley ruptures using anatomic preparation as the reference. Methods and materials: 30 fingers from 10 human cadavers were examined at 3T and 7T before and after being subjected to single and multiple iatrogenic pulley ruptures. MRI protocols were comparable in duration. Two experienced radiologists evaluated the MRIs and defined the location and morphology of finger pulley lesions. Image quality was graded according to a 4-point Likert scale. The diagnostic performance was assessed with anatomic preparation as a gold standard. Interobserver agreement was calculated using Cohen's Kappa coefficients (\u03ba). Results: In a comparison of 7T versus 3T sensitivity and specificity for the detection of A2, A3 and A4 pulley lesions were comparable with 100% versus 95%, respectively, 98% versus 100%. In the assessment of A3 pulley lesions sensitivity of 7T was superior to 3T MRI (100% vs 83%), whereas specificity was lower (95% vs 100%). Image quality assessed before and after iatrogenic rupture was comparable with 2.74 for 7T and 2.61 for 3T, reflecting adequate image quality in average, whereas the visualisation of the A3 finger flexor pulley before rupture creation was significantly better for 7T (p<0.001). Interobserver variability was substantial at 7T (\u03ba=0.90) and 3T (\u03ba=0.80). Conclusion: MRI at 3T and 7T allows direct visualisation and characterisation of traumatic A2, A3, and A4 pulley lesions with higher agreement rates for 7T. High-field MRI is a modern approach for the pre-surgical evaluation compared to indirect techniques such as ultrasound depending of bowstringing. Limitations: An ex-vivo cadaver study.

Hayes, H. Wright, E. Bloomquist; Hollywood, FL/US  (hayesmac@comcast.net)    Purpose: To assess the long-term performance of wire-free SCOUT localisation in the breast and axilla in neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients prior to surgery. Methods and materials: Adult female breast cancer patients had wire-free SCOUT localisation (WFL) prior to neoadjuvant treatment and surgery between February 13, 2017, and July 3, 2019. Electronic medical record and surgical pathology determined the study endpoints. Primary: Rate of successful surgery using WFL prior to NACT. Secondary: Number of days to surgery, success rate of WFL placement, stability, and device-related complications. Results: 38 WFL (16 breast and 22 axilla) were successfully placed prior to NACT in 34 patients, age 29-74 (mean 52) years. All (100%) underwent definitive breast cancer surgery after 32 to 516 (average 198) days. Standard imaging (MG, US, MRI, CT) was used to monitor response to NACT, specimen radiograph and surgical pathology reports documented no significant SCOUT migration (>5mm), no adverse events, and no obscuration of target tissue in 16/16 MRI exams. Conclusion: Since longer-duration SCOUT WFL lead to successful surgery without adverse events or limitations on MRI, this study suggests the possibility of a clinically relevant paradigm shift regarding the timing of preoperative localisation. WFL prior to NACT response maintains flexible options for the surgical team, including de-escalation of breast or axillary lymph node surgery. Limitations: This single-institution pilot was limited by a small study size. A multi-centre study including other WFL devices (TAG, MAGSEED, SmartClip) may provide further generalised knowledge for breast treatment teams.

Sella, B. Simor, B. Maly, E. Carmon; Jerusalem/IL (tamarse@hadassah.org.il)Purpose: MRI is documented as the most accurate imaging modality to evaluate response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). consequently, surgical planning is mandated by post-NAC MRI findings. However, if the tumour demonstrates extensive calcification on mammography (MG) at diagnosis, complete excision of calcifications is the common practice, regardless of MR findings. The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of MRI to predict complete response in tumours with versus without calcifications on MG. Methods and materials: We retrospectively analysed pre and post NAC MG and MRI in 114 consecutive patients at a single institution, 64 (56%) with noncalcified tumours and 50 (44%) with calcifications on MG which correlated in extent with the suspicious enhancement on MRI. Response to NAC was assessed on MRI and compared with post-surgical pathology. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square or Fisher exact test, p< 0.05 considered significant. Results: Demographics and tumour characteristics were similar in both groups. MRI predicted response to NAC equally in both groups showing 40% vs 41% complete, 52% vs 53% partial, and 8% vs 6% no response in patients with calcifications compared to no calcifications respectively (p=0.958). Concordance between MRI prediction and response on pathology was equal between the 2 groups, 70% with calcifications and 69% without, p=0.886. Among discordant cases, there was a small non-significant tendency for overestimation of response by MRI in patients without calcifications (19% vs 12%, p=0.24). Mastectomy was more commonly performed in patients with calcifications (66%) than those without (52%). Conclusion: MRI predicts response to NAC equally in patients with calcified versus non-calcified tumours. Post NAC surgical planning based on MR findings should be considered in patients with tumour calcifications similar to those without. Limitations: A retrospective study.

E. Sinitsyn, A. Shilova, D. Shchekochikhin, M. Gilyarov,  A. Nesterov, A. Svet; Moscow/RU (pershina86@mail.ru)    Purpose: To analyse cardiovascular MR (CMR) features in myocardial infarction with non-obstructed coronaries (MINOCA) patients in an emergency hospital. Methods and materials: The registry included the consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department between 2018 and 2019 with cardiac chest pain, elevated troponin (>0.04 ng/ml), and non-obstructed coronaries (according to results of cardiac catheterisation). They were referred to CMR performed with 1.5T scanner including cine-MR, T2-weighted images, and sequences with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Patients were divided into 4 categories based on their CMR findings: myocardial infarction (MI), myocarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and normal CMR. Cases with apical ballooning without LGE were diagnosed as takotsubo syndrome (TS). Results: 28 MINOCA patients (average age 61.6\u00b113.4, 44% male) were included in the registry. CMR was performed 8 days (median) after patients' admission. 32.1% of patients presented with ST-elevation MI (STE). The average troponin T level was 0.64\u00b10.18 ng/ml. CMR was able to identify the cause for the troponin rise in 75% of the patients. 25% of them had myocarditis, 25% acute MI, 13.2% HCM, and 7.1% TS. The results of CMR were normal in 25%. There was no difference between patients with and without ST-segment elevation according to the patterns of MR findings (p=0.6). Troponin levels, age, and sex did not significantly differ between the groups (p=0.15, p=0.29, and p=0.11, respectively). Conclusion: The registry preliminary revealed that patients with MINOCA represent a heterogeneous cohort with different underlying causes with similar clinical and demographical data. CMR was able to establish the correct diagnosis in 75% of cases. There is a probability that the prevalence of TS was underestimated due to substantial time gap between admission and CMR.

Patients with and without PE were comparable for age, sex, percentage of patients with MIO (global heart T2*<20 ms), and biventricular parameters. The mean follow-up time was 44.55\u00b120.35 months and there were 15 deaths, 9 due to cardiac causes. Cardiac mortality was greater for patients with PE versus those without PE (8.0% vs 0.6%, P=0.013). PE was a significant predictive factor for cardiac death (hazard ratio-HR=19.25, 95%CI=3.96-93.66, P<0.0001. PE remained a significant prognosticator for death also in a multivariate model including MIO. Conclusion: PE is quite rare in TM patients and is not related to MIO, but an important role in its development could be played by the 'iron-induced' pericardial siderosis. PE is a strong predictor for cardiac death, independent from the presence of MIO. The non-invasive diagnosis of PE is important for a more complete definition of the cardiac involvement of TM patients and the estimation of the prognosis. Limitations: A low number of events.

Lu, T. Wei; Chengdu/CN Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of multiparametric ultrasound consisting of B-mode intraoral ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), and shear-wave elastography (SWE) in identifying benign and malignant oral lesions. Methods and materials: A consecutive series of 29 patients (age range, 31-81 years; mean 61\u00b112 years; 18 male and 11 female) were evaluated in this study retrospectively. B-mode, CEUS, and SWE examinations were performed in each case using an endocavitary transducer prior to operation. The quantitative parameters were recorded for each modality. The diagnostic performances of each modality and their combined use were evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and descriptive statistics. Results: Of the 32 lesions, there were 21 malignant lesions and 11 benign lesions. Compared with separate B-mode, CEUS, and SWE examination, multiparametric ultrasound showed the highest value in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and overall accuracy of 90.5%, 81.8%, 90.5% 81.8%, and 87.5%, respectively. Multiparametric ultrasound achieved larger area under the curve (AUC) in ROC curve analysis and reduced the number of false-positive findings significantly (P<0.05). Conclusion: Multiparametric intraoral ultrasound consisting of B-mode, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and shear-wave elastography yields additional valuable quantitative data to single ultrasound modalities for the diagnosis of oral lesions. Limitations: This study design was retrospective and the sample size was relatively small.

Freitas; S\u00e3o Paulo/BR (ricardomcfreitas@gmail.com)Purpose: Cervical traumatic neuromas (CTN) following lateral neck dissection for thyroid cancer may be misdiagnosed as metastatic lymph nodes. The purpose of this study was to present the B-mode, colour Doppler, and shearwave elastography (SWE) ultrasound (US) features of the CTNs and the differences from lymphadenopathies. Methods and materials: 79 patients with US CTNs features were selected from 206 patients who underwent cervical US after neck dissection if the following was present: 1) nodule continuity with cervical plexus, 2) posterolateral location, 3) fusiform morphology, 4) hypoechogenic internal lines, and 5) Doppler-flow absence. 31 patients (group 1, n=38 nodules) underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAb). Two radiologists blinded to the cytological results evaluated 26 patients (n=31 nodules, group 1) with B-mode, colour Doppler, and SWE. US features (except SWE) were then compared to 42 patients (n=48 nodules, group dual-energy CT (DECT) datasets with hormonal status and pathologic results with phantom validation. Methods and materials: We retrospectively enrolled 227 patients (M:F=70:157, age= 47.9\u00b110.6Yr) who consecutively underwent both US and neck CT examination before thyroid surgery during the past two years. On the additional iodine map from pre-contrast images obtained by dual-layer detector DECT scanner (120kVp), 3-dimensional IC measurement was done at the thyroid parenchyma sonographically devoid of nodules. After that, we statistically determined the mean IC of thyroid parenchyma depending on the thyroid hormonal status and pathologic results. A gammex phantom containing 7 iodine chambers with different IC ranging from 2 to 20mgI/ml was used to validate the accuracy of our scan parameters to calculate IC. Results: Among the 165 euthyroid patients, the mean parenchymal IC was significantly lower in patients with pathologically proven Hashimoto's thyroiditis than those devoid of thyroiditis (0.95\u00b10.49 vs 1.44\u00b10.50, p<0.01). In the other 56 hyper-/hypothyroidism patients, the mean parenchymal IC was 0.35\u00b10.59. From the phantom study for IC quantification, measurement error ranged from -0.2% to 2.0% with our DECT protocols. Conclusion: DECT iodine quantification for inherent iodine could be helpful to understand thyroid parenchymal disorders. Limitations: Limited to the specific technical parameters, for example, type of DECT or scanning condition.

Petralia 1 ; 1 Milan/IT, 2 Meldola/IT, 3 Erlangen/DE (bombelli.luca@virgilio.it) Purpose: In literature, there is little documentation of ADC values in normal bone marrow and of the effects of physiological factors. The aim of this study is to evaluate how sex, age, and fat (evaluated from %FF) affect the ADC values measured in the bone marrow of healthy individuals. Methods and materials: We processed the diffusion-weighted images of WB-MRI examinations in 100 asymptomatic individuals, 50 men and 50 women aged 30-79 years. The mean value of ADC in bone marrow (ADCbm) was estimated by fitting the histogram extracted from the images with a semi-automatic segmentation technique. The %FF value was measured as the average of ROIs drawn in specific positions (iliac bone, D10, L4). Gender differences were assessed with the Mann-Whitney U test, while ADCbm correlations with age and %FF were assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient (\u03c1). Results: The values of ADCbm were significantly higher in women than in men (respectively 458.1\u00b163.3 \u00b5m 2 /s and 383.0\u00b158.4 \u00b5m 2 /s, p<0.01). A significant negative correlation of ADCbm with age (\u03c1=-0.46, p< 0,001) was observed in women but was absent in men (\u03c1=-0.04, p=0.79). Moreover, there was a negative correlation between ADCbm and %FF in both women and men (respectively: \u03c1=-0.52, p<0.001 and \u03c1=-0.28, p<0.05). Conclusion: There was a significant difference between ADCbm values of men and women. The negative correlation between ADCbm and age in women is likely related to menopause, while that between ADCbm and %FF, present in both sexes, appears to be a separate process. Limitations: Calculate ADCbm and %FF with two different approaches. Ethics committee approval: Approved by an internal review board. Funding: No funding was received for this work.

            "text": "All data was retrieved from the Cancer Imaging Archive. Patients with OPSCC, known HPV-status, and pre-treatment PET/CT were included. The primary tumour and metastatic cervical nodes were separately segmented on PET scans; segmentations were then copied and adapted to the coregistered CT. A set of 1,040 radiomics features was extracted from each segmentation and per imaging modality. To predict HPV-status, minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance (MRMR) feature selection and random forest (RF) machine learning classifiers were applied in 5-fold cross-validation, repeated x10. The area-under-the-curve of receiver-operating-characteristic-curves (AUC-of-ROC) averaged across validation folds is reported. Results: Of 114 included OPSCC cases, 87 had HPV-positive and 27 had HPVnegative forms. In addition to primary tumour lesions, 119 HPV-positive and 51 HPV-negative metastatic cervical nodes were analysed. The primary tumour RF models achieved an averaged AUC-of-ROC of 0.69 (PET), 0.75 (CT), and 0.73 (PET/CT), based on 20 features selected by MRMR from the respective feature sets. In comparison, the averaged AUC of lymph node RF models was 0.66 (PET) and 0.64 (CT), based on 20 MRMR-features. PET-based lymph node models were non-predictive. Conclusion: Radiomics feature extraction from FDG-PET and non-contrast CT scans, combined with machine learning classifiers, can generate imaging biomarkers for HPV-status in OPSCC primary tumours and metastatic lymph nodes, which may aid pathologists in HPV-classification if standard immunohistochemical staining is equivocal or supplement the immunohistochemical tests in subjects requiring second-line testing.

A semi-automatic technique for the segmentation of diffusion-weighted images in WB-MRI examination has been developed to allow quantitative evaluation of tumour burden in bone metastases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the intra and interobserver repeatability of quantitative analysis of ADC in healthy and metastatic bone marrow in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer (BCa) and prostate cancer (PCa). Methods and materials: 4 independent observers processed WB-MRI examinations from 20 patients with bone metastases (10 women with BCa and 10 men with PCa). Segmentation of bone marrow was performed applying a threshold on high b-value diffusion-weighted images and manually removing misclassified non-bone regions. The total volume of bone marrow (Vbm) and firstorder ADC statistics were then obtained. We measured repeatability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman method.

Methods and materials: We performed a prospective, unicentric study approved by the research ethics committee, which included patients with choroidal melanoma and indication for brachytherapy. Three DW-MRI examinations were proposed for each patient, one before and two after treatment. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was calculated on DW-MRI and compared with local tumour control assessed by ophthalmologic followup. Results: From 07/2018 to 06/2019, 19 patients were included, of which 13 underwent follow-up examinations. Patients' ages ranged from 24 to 78 years and 52.9% were male. At the ocular ultrasound, the mean tumour thickness and diameter were 6.3 mm and 11.5 mm, respectively. At initial MRI, most tumours presented high or intermediate signal at T1 (82.3%) and a low signal at T2 (70.6%). Two patients (15.4%) showed signs of tumour progression during follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference in tumour size between MR before and after treatment, however, there was a significant reduction in mean ADC in patients with progression (p = 0.02).Conclusion: DW-MRI has shown to be useful in assessing patients with choroidal melanoma and mean ADC values can be used for response assessment, allowing early identification of patients at risk for progression after brachytherapy.

Ma; Beijing/ CN (yyqf@hotmail.com) Purpose: To evaluate the macular change in the patients with diabetic retinopathy using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) technique. Methods and materials: Twenty patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and 20 normal controls (NC) were included. The fast spoiled gradient recalled sequence was used to perform dynamic contrast T1WI enhancement on 3.0T MR system. The macular region, optic papilla and nasal retina were performed with quantitative DCE-MRI evaluation using Omni-Kinetics software. Results: The maximal concentration, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUCconcentration-time) and maximal slope of macular region were significantly higher in DR [0.270 (0.03, 1.20) mmol/100ml, 2.71 (0.04, 9.91 ) mmol*min and 0.38 (0.06,3.18) mmol/min, respectively] than that [0.169(0.03,0.72) mmol/\u30011.25 (0.13,10.41) mmol*min and 0.245 (0.06,1.34) mmol/min] in NC (U value = 515.00 and P value = 0.080, U value = 433.00 and P value = 0.000, and U value = 563.00 and P value = 0.023, respectively). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis demonstrated that the area under AUCconcentration-time was 0.729\u00b10.058 with the cut-off value 1.479 mmol*min (sensitivity 80.00% and specificity 62.50%) for macular region. Conclusion: The quantitative DCE-MRI technique could be used to evaluate the maculopathy associated with the diabetic retinopathy. Limitations: The limits of this study are that the region of interest (ROI) in the retinochoroidal complex, the enhanced concentration of choroid was also included in the regions, would not truly reflect retinopathy entirely based on the current MRI technique.

S. Arunachalam, S. Saxena, R. Dev, P. Sharma, U. Chauhan, S. Sharma, N. Chatterjee; Rishikesh/ IN (drvenkat07@gmail.com) Purpose: To ascertain any correlation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters -fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with standard MR findings and clinical severity. Methods and materials: Patients presenting with cervical myelopathy to neurosurgery/orthopedic outpatient department and without recent traumatic history, neuroparenchymal pathology or contraindication to MRI and agreeing to undergo MRI were examined with MRI of the cervical spine. In addition to standard MRI sequences for imaging the cervical spinal cord, diffusion tensor imaging based on single-shot EPI with 20 diffusion directions, each encoded with b-values of 0mm2/s and 1000mm2/s was performed in both sagittal and axial planes. Postprocessing of the raw DTI data was done using ready view developed by GE (Advantage4.7). Stenotic and non-stenotic levels were compared with Kang's grading and DTI parameters. Baseline clinical severity was assessed based on modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score. Using SPSS(ver23), Anova's test was done to assess different Grade individuals. Pearson's correlation of FA with ADC, Kang's grade and mJOA score were calculated. Results: 43 patients were included in the study. Mean FA values recorded at stenotic (0.346) was less than non-stenotic (0.600) levels. A negative correlation of -0.661 and -0.362 was recorded between FA and ADC and stenotic grading (Kang's), respectively. Level of significance was recorded at 0.013. Conclusion: Diffusion tensor imaging can serve as a potential tool for understanding pathophysiology thereby complementing anatomical information from standard sequences and aid in prognostication of patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy prior to surgical and non-surgical management. Limitations: Changes in DTI parameters were not recorded following treatment. Technical limitations of DTI may be overcome by using HARDI and Q space imaging.

For the evaluation, the cervical arterial system was divided into 35 segments (right and left side). Three blinded reviewers separately evaluated these segments. An ordinal scoring system was used to assess the image quality of arterial segments and the stenosis grading of carotid arteries. Results: Overall venous contamination in quiescent-interval slice-selective MRA was rated as \"none\" by all readers in 84.9% of the cases and in 8.1% of cases in contrast-enhanced MRA (p=0.0001). The visualisation quality of arterial segments was considered good to excellent in 40.2% for the quiescent-interval slice-selective MRA and in 52.2% for the contrast-enhanced MRA (p=0.0001). The diagnostic accuracy of ungated quiescent-interval slice-selective MRA concerning the stenosis grading showed a total sensitivity and specificity of 85.7% and 90.0%, respectively. Conclusion: Ungated quiescent-interval slice-selective MRA can be used clinically as an alternative to contrast-enhanced MRA without a significantly different image quality or diagnostic accuracy for the detection of carotid stenosis at 1.5T.

Respiratory physicians, blinded to the reporter, compared reports for agreement. Discordant cases were reviewed by thoracic radiologists, blinded to the reporter, who reached the index diagnosis and graded report elements (observation, interpretation, recommendations, and usefulness). The number of CR and RR generated CT scans and lung cancers diagnosed were recorded. Results: 8,685 of 9,136 (95.1%) CXRs were included. Agreement and insignificant disagreement between CR/RR reports occurred in 5,981 (68.9%) and 1,347 (15.5%) of cases, respectively. 1,357 (15.6%) of CR/RR reports had clinically significant disagreement. Thoracic radiology review has been performed for 908 of 1,357 (66.9%) discordant reports. Both reports were correct in 292 (32.2%), CR report correct in 255 (28.1%), RR report correct in 271 (29.8%), and neither report correct in 90 (9.9%). Thoracic radiologists were no more likely to agree with a CR or RR report (p=0.49;CI=-0.03,0.07). RR reports were non-inferior to CR reports for observation ( Purpose: To extra-validate and evaluate the reproducibility of a commercial deep learning-based automatic detection (DLAD) algorithm for pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs and to compare its performance with radiologists. Methods and materials: This retrospective study enrolled 434 chest radiographs (normal to abnormal ratio, 242:192) from 378 patients that visited a tertiary hospital. DLAD performance was compared with two radiology residents and two thoracic radiologists. Abnormality assessment (using the area under the receiver operating characteristics, AUROC) and nodule detection (using jackknife alternative free-response ROC, JAFROC) were compared among three groups (DLAD only, radiologist without DLAD, and radiologist with DLAD). A subset of 56 paired cases, having two chest radiographs taken within a 7-day period, were assessed for intraobserver reproducibility using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Independent characteristics of pulmonary nodules detected by DLAD were assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: The AUROC for abnormality detection for the three groups were 0.872, 0.929, 0.963, respectively (p<0.05), whereas the JAFROC analysis of nodule detection was 0.912, 0.834, and 0.948 (p<0.05). Reproducibility was 0.80, 0.67, and 0.80, which shows an increase in radiologists using DLAD (p<0.05). Nodules detected by DLAD were more solid, round-shaped, and well-marginated without masking (p<0.05). Conclusion: Extra validation results of DLAD showed high ROC results and there was a significant improvement in the performance when radiologists used DLAD. Reproducibility by DLAD alone showed good agreement and there was an improvement from moderate to good agreement for radiologists using DLAD.

Methods and materials: Six anesthetised New Zealand white rabbits who received Xe-DECT scans using xenon gas as a contrast agent with a concentration of 70% Xe-30% oxygen, administered by mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Dynamic DECT scans (Revolution CT, GE Healthcare) were obtained over multiple breathing cycles during a Xe gas wash-in (WI) and washout (WO) sequence by performing 15 repetitive acquisitions with a 1,01s interscan delay. In addition, bronchoconstriction was induced by inhaled methacholine (40 mg/ml) and all scan sequences were repeated. Material decomposition was applied to isolate Xe from the image data and parametric ventilation maps were created to quantify Xe concentration in the segmented lungs. We compared the evolution of the regional Xe concentration (mg Xe/mL) in a normal and bronchoconstricted state. Results: In a normal state, the maximum Xe concentration in the lungs was 1.60\u00b10.45 mg/mL, which was reached after 15.6\u00b16.9 s. During WO, a 50% decrease in Xe concentration was observed after 12.1\u00b11.3s. The parametric maps clearly showed the increase and decrease of Xe concentration during the WI and WO sequences. After induction of bronchoconstriction, local ventilation defects could be visually detected. Animals showed a reduced Xe concentration in affected areas (1.27\u00b10.68 mg/mL) compared to a normal state (1.91\u00b10.65 mg/mL), and also higher concentration in non-affected areas (2.26\u00b10.71 mg/mL) Erlangen/DE (metz_c1@ukw.de) Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of non-contrast-enhanced 3D-UTE MRI for pulmonary imaging in immunocompromised patients during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods and materials: 28 patients with an indication for allogeneic HSCT were included in this prospective single-centre study and underwent thoracic MRI before HSCT initiation, in case of suspected pneumonia, and before discharge following completion of HSCT. MRI was acquired using a prototypical stack-of-spirals 3D-UTE sequence within a single breath-hold. Clinically indicated MDCT and a clinically used T2 weighted sequence were used as diagnostic reference. 3D-UTE MR and T2 weighted MR image sets were separately reviewed by two radiologists regarding presence of pleural effusions (PE), ground-glass opacities (GGO), and consolidations. Each MDCT used as reference for MRI results was assessed regarding the same items in consensus reading. Results: A total of 62 MRI scans were acquired without periprocedural complications. 3D-UTE MRI allowed for sufficient imaging of pulmonary consolidations (sensitivity 78%, specificity 82%, PPV 84%, and NPV 76%). Regarding PE (sensitivity 54%, specificity 99%, PPV 92%, and NPV 89%) and GGO (sensitivity 49%, specificity 87%, PPV 45%, and NPV 88%), the diagnostic performance was lower. Overall consistency rate was high (79-90%). Inter-rater agreement was moderate to substantial (PE=0.62, GGO=0.57, consolidations=0.70). 3D-UTE was equivalent (54%) or superior (43%) when compared to T2 weighted MRI in detecting ground-glass opacity areas and consolidations. Conclusion: With an acquisition time similar to MDCT, radiation-free and contrast-free 3D-UTE MRI can be expected to play a major role in future pulmonary imaging, for example, in diagnostics and follow-up of immunocompromised patients with pneumonia.

Purpose: Automated lung segmentation in chest x-rays can bring many benefits for the optimisation of image analysis pipelines, such as lung textures quantification and pathologies classification. Our goal was to improve lung segmentation by using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a database augmented by means of a generative adversarial neural network (GAN). Methods and materials: Three public datasets of chest radiographs with manual segmentation masks of the lungs were gathered for the purpose of training CNNs. To increase the variability of the dataset, the radiographs from healthy subjects were augmented by means of a GAN. Additionally, 100 manually segmented cases from the ChestXray14 database were used for testing purposes. To evaluate different deep learning approaches, a deeply-supervised UNET and a Mask R-CNN were trained with the augmented samples. The performance of both models was measured by means of the Dice score coefficient between the predictions and the manual segmentations of the ChestXray14 database. Results: The model based on the deeply-supervised UNET architecture obtained an average Dice score of 0.94 for the right lung and 0.95 for the left lung. The model based on the Mask R-CNN architecture obtained an average Dice score of 0.96 for the right lung and 0.96 for the left lung. Conclusion: Optimising the segmentation of the lungs in chest radiographs is feasible by means of convolutional neural networks trained with augmented data. The use of these techniques allows the learning of robust segmentation models and refining them with the generation of realistic augmented data. Purpose: Using a clinical prototype for x-ray dark-field chest radiography, attenuation, differential-phase, and dark-field radiographs of the human chest are obtained to investigate the diagnostic value for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. Therefore, different visualisation concepts of combined dark-field and attenuation images are evaluated. Methods and materials: In the hue-saturation-visibility colour space, the two images are fused together by entering different channels of the colour space: the dark-field signal determines the hue and saturation channel while the transmission value determines the value channel. In the red-green-blue-alpha colour space, the combination is achieved by a superposition of the two images using the transparent alpha-channel. For this purpose, the dark-field signal strength is encoded by a colour map while also defining a transparency map. The colour map is subsequently superimposed on the attenuation image using the transparency map. Results: For each patient, an individually adjustable overlay is available to the radiologists as an additional tool to identify and evaluate possible diagnostic findings as well as to assess the strength of the signal of different lung regions.",

The level of noise allowed in the reconstruction was defined as \u03c3. During the reconstruction algorithm, different levels of noise reduction were applied (\u03c3min = 10 -5 ; \u03c3max = 7.0) and the raw image, as well as the reconstructed images, were assessed by two experienced radiologists in terms of image definition and noise independently.",

Conclusion: Moderate noise reduction in in-vivo dark-field chest x-ray radiographs may lead to an improvement in image quality in contrast to the raw image, while a high amount of noise reduction may lead to a loss of anatomical information. Thereby, noise reduction may increase usability in a clinical setting as well as in future investigations with regard to the evaluation of diseases, e. g. improved diagnosis and staging of COPD. Limitations: n/a Ethics committee approval: This ongoing prospective study was institutional review board (IRB) approved and the dark-field contrast x-ray imaging device has been approved for use in humans by the Federal Office for Radiation Protection. Purpose: To develop a robust approach for the image reconstruction within the scopeof a first clinical patient experiment on x-ray dark-field chest radiography investigating its potential benefits for the diagnosis of pulmonary disorders. Methods and materials: Images were acquired using an x-ray grating interferometer tailored to clinical dark-field imaging of the human chest, operating at 70kVp. Three gratings were placed in the x-ray beam path, the first and second generating an intensity pattern, which was then analysed, utilising the third one. Conventionally, this is done by acquiring images at different relative positions of the gratings. Since constraints given by the fabrication process and alignment difficulties prevent the use of full-field gratings, the interferometer was moved continuously to obtain the necessary field of view of 37\u00d737cm 2 . Consequently, moving the gratings with respect to each other needed to be avoided to keep acquisition times sufficiently short (7s). Instead, by a slight misalignment of the gratings, a so-called moir\u00e9 fringe pattern was formed. The contrast of these fringes was reduced by small-angle scattering within the tissue, which constitutes the dark-field signal and could be extracted by combining several of these displaced fringe patterns. Results: An attenuation image, comparable to a conventional radiograph, and a dark-field image were computed from the overlapping raw detector images obtained from the scanning system. Conclusion: Dark-field images can be obtained from a scanning setup meeting clinical requirements concerning coverage and acquisition speed. Limitations: Due to the scanning acquisition scheme, there are some welllocalised residual fringe artifacts caused by cardiac motion. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the national radiation protection agency and the institutional review board. Garching/DE, 3 Hamburg/DE (tina.ml@web.de) Purpose: To evaluate the first dark-field chest x-ray images on living humans and to assess image quality and visual impression, comparing inspiration and expiration. Methods and materials: We have recently designed, constructed, and commissioned a worldwide first experimental prototype for grating-based darkfield chest radiography. 54 patients with either an overall inconspicuous chest CT or signs of pulmonary emphysema were selected and underwent conventional chest x-ray in inspiration as well as dark-field imaging in expiration and inspiration, posterior-anterior respectively. All images were evaluated by two blinded radiologists analysing the images in terms of quality and signal strength, comparing those in expiration and inspiration. Clinical information (history of lung emphysema yes/no) was later taken into account. Results: We found that both images in inspiration and expiration using x-ray dark-field radiography show good quality and appear to be feasible for clinical use. Looking at one of the dark-field images only was enough to identify pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary emphysema, although having both dark-field radiographs in inspiration and expiration helped to confirm the diagnosis and gave additional information to understand dynamic changes during breathing. Conclusion: The first dark-field x-ray images on living humans show promising results with high potential clinical value in inspiration as well as expiration. To detect pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary emphysema, it is enough to have either one inspiratory or expiratory image, however, having both gave additional information about dynamic pulmonalry changes during breathing. Limitations: In this rather early state, we only have a limited number of examinations to analyse. We expect more concrete and significant results during the course of our study. Ethics committee approval: An approval by the institutional review board (IRB) was obtained. Purpose: To compare living human emphysema quantification using the first xray dark-field chest radiograph examinations versus CT. Methods and materials: In total, 500 patients will be included in this study. So far, 79 patients were recruited after receiving a clinical CT-scan with contrast showing no pulmonary pathologies besides emphysema. For each patient, four dark-field images of the thorax (posterior-anterior and lateral, in inspiration, and in expiration) were performed using a clinical prototype. All images were evaluated by three radiologists who were blinded to the GOLD-stadium regarding signal strength. Based on the rating for signal strength, grading of emphysema was performed. The CT-examination of each patient was evaluated with dedicated software (IntelliSpace Portal, Philips GmbH) regarding the percentage of emphysematous lung tissue. Consequently, the correlation between visual dark-field signal and resulting grading of emphysema and CT based emphysema quantification was evaluated. Results: The results from this first clinical dark-field chest radiography demonstrate a high correlation of CT and dark-field images regarding the grading of pulmonary emphysema. Dark-field images obtained in inspiration showed a better correlation with CT compared to dark-field images obtained in expiration. Posterior-anterior images showed a better correlation than lateral images, but the latter are useful for anatomical assignment. Conclusion: Detection and grading of COPD is possible with dark-field x-ray radiography with a high correlation to CT, resulting in decreased radiation exposure (0.04 mSv) as well as fewer time expanses. Limitations: Only a relatively small number of patients was included. For further evaluation, more patients have to be examined. Ethics committee approval: The study was institutional review board (IRB) approved. All patients signed informed consent. Purpose: To investigate dark-field chest x-ray for the detection and staging of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by correlation of dark-field signal strength to lung function tests in a first patient study. Methods and materials: In this ongoing prospective clinical study, 79 of 500 adult study participants (250 patients with different stages of COPD and 250 patients without lung diseases) were enrolled. Dark-field chest x-rays were acquired using a grating-based prototype imaging setup operating at 70 kVp in scanning mode. As a reference, conventional chest x-ray, whole-body plethysmography, and COPD assessment test were performed. Clinically indicated computed tomography scans were also included in the study. Visual assessment of dark-field signal strength using a 5-point ordinal scale was performed by three independent readers. In addition, dark-field signal strength was quantitatively evaluated. Results were correlated with findings of lung function tests. Results: Dark-field signal strength correlated with the Tiffeneau-Pinelli index, which is given as the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1 as a percent of predicted measured in whole-body plethysmography. Conclusion: Dark-field signal strength may serve as a diagnostic marker of pulmonary function in COPD by visualising structural changes of the lung parenchyma. As a novel imaging modality, dark-field chest x-ray may have the potential to facilitate early diagnosis of COPD and improve the monitoring of the clinical course of disease while requiring less cooperation than spirometry. Limitations: n/a Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the institutional review board and the federal office for radiation protection. Written consent was obtained from all patients. DE (theresa.urban@tum.de) Purpose: To evaluate the first clinical dark-field chest x-ray images with respect to the breathing state of the patient. Methods and materials: We constructed a clinical prototype for dark-field chest radiography suitable for human chest imaging, with an overall acquisition time of 7 seconds and a tube voltage of 70kVp. So far, more than 80 patients have been examined in posterior-anterior orientation in inspiration and expiration, with an average effective dose of 0.04mSv per radiograph. Results: The dark-field signal in the lung can vary in strength due to both a difference in lung thickness as well as microstructural variations. In inspiration, the dark-field signal is quite homogeneous over the lung, which can be attributed to a homogeneous distribution of alveolar size and density. In expiration, the dark-field signal is higher, particularly in the lower parts of the lung. This is likely caused by an increase of air-tissue interfaces in the beam path due to the compression of lung parenchyma. The difference in dark-field signal between the two breathing states allows spatially identification of the regions of the lung that change micro-morphologically and thus participate in the ventilation of the lung. Conclusion: This technique provides spatial information about microstructural changes in the lung and thus the physiological activity of different lung regions during breathing. The change in signal strength illustrates its sensitivity to the microstructure of the lung, promising a distinct diagnostic value of dark-field images for the assessment of lung diseases. Limitations: At this rather early state of the ongoing study, there is a limited number of examinations. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the ethics committee and by the national radiation protection agency. Participants gave written informed consent. Purpose: To evaluate the ability of shoulder three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) and additional ABER (abduction-external rotation) scans to assess bipolar bone loss and detect on-track/off-track lesions in traumatic shoulder instability, by using MPR CT images as reference. Methods and materials: 25 consecutive patients (14 male, 11 female, range 20-44) with clinical evidence of anterior shoulder instability. All patients underwent 3D-CT of the shoulder and direct shoulder MRA using threedimensional (3D) isotropic PD sequences in standard and ABER position. Two blinded independent observers randomly evaluated the images twice to assess the glenoid track, the Hill-Sachs interval, and to predict engagement by using the \"on-track/off-track\" method. The intra and interobserver agreement was calculated.Results: Out of 25 defect combinations, 13 were codified as non-engaging and 12 as engaging by using the \"on-track/off-track\" method. The intraobserver reliability was 0.921 for 3D-CT and 0.786 for MRA. The interobserver agreement ranged from \"substantial\" to \"almost perfect\" for both glenoid track and Hill-Sachs interval measurements (p<0.005). ABER MRA predicted engagement accurately in 23 cases (91.3%). Conclusion: MRA using 3D isotropic PD sequences is a reliable method in assessing defects of bone in patients affected by anterior shoulder instability and bipolar bone loss by using the \"on-track/off-track\" method. The same sequence in the ABER position could predict the presence of engaging lesions.Limitations: The small sample size. (felix.wuennemann@med.uni-heidelberg.de) Purpose: Using arthroscopy as a gold standard, we prospectively evaluated T2 mapping of the shoulder regarding matrix changes of the labrum in patients with and without superior-labral-anterior-to-posterior (SLAP) lesions. Methods and materials: T2 mapping was performed at 3T in 18 consecutive patients (12 men) with shoulder pain followed by shoulder arthroscopy. Two independent raters performed a region-of-interest-analysis in the superior labrum using the colour-coded T2 map. Inter-rater correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. Cut-off values and their sensitivities/specificities including 95% confidence intervals (CI) for detection of SLAP lesions were assessed using arthroscopy as reference. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: The mean age did not differ significantly between n=12 patients with SLAP lesions and n=6 patients without SLAP lesions (55.5 vs 46.2 years, p=0.22). The mean T2 value in labra with proven SLAP lesions was significantly higher compared to those with no SLAP lesions (mean, 37.7\u00b110.6 ms vs 20.8\u00b12.4 ms, p=0.0001). A complete data separation was present, as the maximum T2 value (21.2) in labra with no SLAP lesion was lower than the minimum value in labra with lesions ( Purpose: To investigate whether the repaired tendon thickness and sub-deltoid fluid collection after rotator cuff repair, which was seen on follow-up ultrasound (US), are correlated with clinical outcome and to assess whether these factors lead to different clinical outcomes depending on the surgical method. Methods and materials: This retrospective study included 54 patients who underwent supraspinatus tendon repair with a suture-bridge or single-row technique and follow up US. Two radiologists independently measured the thickness of the repaired supraspinatus tendons and fluid collection in subdeltoid space. We assessed the relationship between the sonographic parameters, including repaired supraspinatus tendon thickness and sub-deltoid fluid collection, with the clinical outcome represented by the Korean shoulder scoring system (KSS) score using correlation coefficients (R). Results: There was a significant relationship between sub-deltoid fluid collection and the pain of the patients (p\u22640.05), although every category showed an inverse relationship with the fluid thickness. The ICC values for sonographic imaging parameters between interpreters ranged from 0.910 to 0.946, showing excellent reproducibility. Conclusion: Sub-deltoid fluid collection of repaired supraspinatus tendons measured on postoperative US can be a useful method in predicting the patient's subjective clinical outcome, especially pain, regardless of age or surgical technique. Limitations: This was a retrospective study. The measurement of sonographic parameters was based on captured images that had been taken prior to assessment and therefore it was not a real-time measurement.

Muscle mass loss after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer: estimation on breast magnetic resonance imaging using pectoralis muscle area F. Rossi, L. Torri, S. de Giorgis, M. Calabrese, A. Tagliafico; Genoa/IT Purpose: Sarcopenia is widely considered a predictor of poor survival and toxicity in breast cancer patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate if there is pectoralis muscle area (PMA) variation, reflecting a loss of skeletal muscle mass, on consecutive MRI examinations during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods and materials: A total of n=110 consecutive patients (mean age 56\u00b111years) who were treated with NAC for histologically proven primary breast cancer between January 2017 and January 2019, and in whom tumour response was checked with standard breast MRI, were included. Two radiologists calculated the pectoralis muscle cross-sectional area before and after NAC. Results: The time between the two MRI examinations, before starting NAC, and after completion of three cycles of NAC was 154,8\u00b134 days. PMA calculated pre-NAC (8,14 cm 2 ) was larger than PMA calculated post-NAC (7,03 cm 2 ), (p<0.001). According to RECIST criteria, there were no significant differences between responders (complete or partial response) and no responders (p=0.362). The multivariate regression analysis did not show any significant relationships between \u2206PMA and age, the time between MRI exams, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor status (HER-2), Ki-67 expression, lymph nodes status, RECIST criteria, or histological type and grade. Inter-reader (k=0.72) and intra-reader agreement (0.69 and 0.71) in PMA assessment were good. Conclusion: Pectoralis muscle mass variation, reflecting loss of skeletal muscle mass, in breast cancer patients undergoing NAC can be estimated directly on standard breast MRI. Limitations: Known limitations are the retrospective nature of the study and the lack of a control-group. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by our institutional review board.

Yi; 2 Shenzhen/CN (2635063963@qq.com) Purpose: To analyse the different shrinkage pattern of breast tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and to evaluate the efficacy of different shrinkage pattern in chemotherapy. Methods and materials: Data from 50 patients who were diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer underwent NAC before surgery after the eighth cycle of NAC was analysed retrospectively. All patients underwent MRI scan with contrast enhancement. The shrinkage pattern was classified into 3 categories: concentric shrinkage, fragment-like shrinkage, and mixed shrinkage. All the patients were divided into pathological complete response (pCR) group and N-pCR group according to the histopathologic tumour response. The \u03c7 2 test were used to compare the baseline characteristics of pCR and N-pCR groups, as well as the tumour enhancement pattern and shrinkage pattern of the molecular types. Associations were evaluated using binary logistic regression models. Results: 16 patients achieved pCR and 34 patients had a residual disease (N-pCR). Age, menopausal status, tumour size, lymph node, T stage, molecular typing, ER, PR, ki-67 status, and tumour enhancement mode on MRI showed no significance between pCR and N-pCR groups (all p>0.05), while only HER2 status and shrinkage pattern a significant difference (p<0.05 in both). Interobserver agreement regarding shrinkage pattern was moderate after NAC (Kappa value 0.719). There were no statistically significant differences in tumour shrinkage pattern and MRI tumour enhancement among the molecular types (all p >0.05). There were statistically significant differences in MRI tumour enhancement in the tumour shrinkage pattern (p<0.05). Logistic model showed that tumour shrinkage pattern after NAC and HER2 status were independent factors for predicting pCR. Conclusion: Shrinkage pattern and HER2 status can be independent factors for predicting pCR. Purpose: To combine the dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and ADC value to serve as early response markers in breast cancer after NAC. Methods and materials: Between July 2014 and July 2016, 50 patients who received NAC were considered to be eligible. All patients underwent a pretreatment breast routine ultrasonography, MRI, DCE-MRI, and DWI. 50 patients underwent these examinations four times prior to treatment. 1st, 2nd, and following the final cycle of NAC. Responses were measured by routine MRI and ultrasonography using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST).",

The areas under the ROC curve were 0.735 for routine MRI in early assessment of the response to NAC. There was a significant difference between responders and nonresponders in K trans , Kep, and TTP after the first cycle of therapy(P=0.022\uff1c0.05). Among various perfusion parameters, the largest areas under the ROC curve were 0.84 for Kep, then that of K trans (0.75). In a combined examination, the largest areas under the ROC curve was 0.88 and that of combined ADC and K trans was the second (0.84). Conclusion: Kep and K trans are superior to routine MRI and ADC value in the early assessment of the response to NAC. Combined ADC with Kep and ADC with K trans are the most recommended parameters that may help determine individual treatments. Limitations: The number of cases was small. All cas-es were invasive ductal carcinoma. This might affect the evalua-tion results. Ethics committee approval: Information about review or animal board approval and written informed consent. Funding: No funding was received for this work. Purpose: Determining disease extent after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is essential for accurate surgical planning. Achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) has shown to have favourable prognosis in certain tumour subtypes, however, the definition of pCR varies between authors and can affect the interpretation of results at systematic reviews. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of post-NAC MRI with reference to different pCR definitions. Methods and materials: Records of patients with locally advanced breast cancer who underwent NAC followed by mastectomy between January 2016 and January 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Post-treatment MRI was correlated with residual disease on final histopathology. Two definitions for pCR were used; the first was an absence of both invasive and in situ components, and the second was an absence of invasive component only. Diagnostic accuracy of post treatment MRI was tested against both definitions separately. Results: 52 women (mean age, 47.4 years; range 28-74) with 56 breast masses were eligible for the study. Complete MRI response was noted in 22 (39%) masses. pCR was achieved in 14 (25%) and 25 (44.6%) masses using the first and second pCR definitions respectively. Negative predictive value (NPV) and overall accuracy of MRI for detecting residual disease was 50% and 75%, respectively, using the first pCR definition. With the second pCR definition, NPV and accuracy were 77.3% and 76.8%, respectively. Conclusion: MRI NPV for residual disease was higher with the second pCR definition, however, overall accuracy was not different. MRI accuracy in detecting residual disease after NAC is not adequate to replace pathological assessment. Limitations: Retrospective design, small sample size, and at single institution.

            "text": "We analysed 37 patients with breast cancer that underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT prior to NST. Maximum standardised uptake values of the primary tumour (SUV-T) and the most FDG-avid lymph node (SUV-LN) and their ratio (NT ratio) were calculated. Patients with and without suspicious ALNM based on prior imaging were compared regarding their SUV values. ALNM response following NST was classified according to the Pinder classification. Patients were defined as responders (Pinder 1-3) and nonresponders (Pinder 4). The association of SUVmax with ALNM response was assessed using ROC analyses. Results: Of 37 patients, 25 (68%) had suspicion for ALNM. Patients with suspected ALNM showed significantly higher SUV-LN (1.5 vs. 6.1) and NT ratio (0.3 vs. 1.0), but no significant difference in SUV-T (6.0 vs. 8.3) was found. Nonsignificant differences between responders and non-responders of SUV-T (7.5 vs. 8.2), SUV-LN (5.6 vs. 5.1), and NT ratio (0.9 vs. 0.7) were found. The AUCs for SUV-T, SUV-LN, and NT ratio were 0.544, 0.630, and 6.11, respectively. An SUV-LN cutoff value of 3.5 had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 49% in identifying patients who responded to NST. Conclusion: 18 F-FDG PET/CT showed promising results in predicting ALNM and their response to NST in breast cancer patients. Limitations: These results are preliminary, hence the low sample size. Ethics committee approval: The need for informed consent was waived by a local ethics committee. Purpose: To assess which clinicopathologic and radiologic factors influence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performance in the demonstration of radiologic response (false positive/negative results) in breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods and materials: A total of 80 patients with breast cancer who underwent breast MRI before and after NAC was included in this study. All patients were diagnosed with core-needle biopsy before treatment for histological tumour type and immunohistochemical markers. Pathological examination was referenced as a gold standard after complete surgical excision. Complete radiological response (rCR) to NAC was accepted when the main lesion site showed no early enhancement on dynamic MRI. Complete pathologic response (pCR) was described as the complete absence of invasive cancer in the surgical material. The clinicopathologic and radiologic factors which influence the radiologicpathologic correlation were analysed. Results: The mean age of cohort was 43.5 years (range:24-64). MRI analysis after NAC showed rCR in 44 cases (55%), while pathological analysis of surgical specimens after NAC detected pCR in 43 cases (53.8%). Based on MRI findings, the radiologic-pathologic discordance was in 23 of 80 cases. Multivariate analysis of radiologic findings to identify predictors: dense breast parenchyme ( BIRADS type C-D), multifocal multicentric lesions, high parenchyme enhancement, and non-mass enhancement in post-treatment MR imaging. Also, there were significantly more frequent cases of tumour nuclear histologic grade luminal B subtype. Conclusion: Patients with dense breast parenchyme (BIRADS type C-D), high parenchyme enhancement, multifocal multicentric lesions, luminal B, invasive ductal type cancer, and non-mass enhancement in post-treatment MR imaging are significantly associated with radiologic-pathologic discordance on MR imaging after NAC. These patient populations should be evaluated in depth. Limitations: A retrospective study, limitation in the number of patients.

Zekio\u011flu: nothing to disclose To determine whether a classifier based on two US parameters (volume and stiffness) is predictive of treatment responses from the first courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods and materials: Prospective US analysis was performed in patients with breast cancer qualified for NAC, before and 7 days after the first four courses of NAC. US examinations with strain sonoelastography were performed using linear transducer L14-5. Tumour volume and tumour stiffness (using Tsukuba scale) were evaluated. The resistant malignant cells [RMC] (ranging from 0-100%) were assessed by a pathologist postoperatively. Histopathological examination classifies tumours as responding (RT) and nonresponding (N-RT). RT included those with a reduction in cellularity \u226530% while Purpose: To investigate the accuracy of MRI in evaluating response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in primary breast cancer and to determine if the presence of DCIS/LCIS can influence the accuracy. MRI has a high specificity for the correct detection of residual tumour after NAC, but low sensitivity (correct identification of complete pathological response (pCR) PPV 48% has been reported). Methods and materials: A cohort of 461 consecutive patients who received NAC in a single cancer centre (2007-2019) with post-NAC pre-surgery MRI and surgery pathology data were analysed. 'Gold Standard' for the response was pCR in the surgical specimen. Radiological complete response (rCR) was defined as 0 mm and non-rCR defined as \u22651 mm, using maximum tumour diameter on MRI. Results: In the whole cohort, MRI sensitivity (probability of identifying a pCR from rCR)=71.0% (88/124), and specificity (probability of correctly identifying non-pCR from non-rCR)=81.0% (273/337). The presence of DCIS/LCIS in the surgical sample reduces the accuracy of MRI assessment, sensitivity by 24.8% (with=53.1% vs without=77.9%), and specificity by 2.4% (with=78.6% vs without=81.0%), increasing overestimation of disease size. False-negative rate (probability of rCR incorrectly identifying pCR) is 46.9% with DCIS/LCIS versus 22.1% without DCIS/LCIS. Conclusion: This analysis showed that there is a need to improve the accuracy of MRI assessment of pCR. There is an urgent need to identify variables which can improve this invaluable tool to optimise treatment planning. Introducing a volumetric and texture AI-driven analysis may increase the accuracy and confidence of MRI with positive clinical benefit leading to better patient treatment and less invasive approach to surgery. Limitations: A retrospective study. Further researches needed. Ethics committee approval: n/a Funding: No funding was received for this work. Purpose: Women with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy undergo breast MRI as part of treatment response assessment. Incidental sternal bone marrow enhancement may be demonstrated and be confused with pathologic findings. Our goal was to evaluate bone marrow enhancement on MRI prior to and upon completion of neoadjuvant treatment. Methods and materials: A retrospective study between the years 2012-2017 included 109 consecutive women with breast cancer and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. MRI was performed before and after treatment to evaluate response. The neoadjuvant regimen included AC-T in adjunct with G-CSF (bone marrow stimulating agent) and steroids. Bone marrow signal intensity was measured at the sternum, before and after contrast injection. Chest wall muscle signal intensity was used as a reference. The index was calculated as bone marrow signal intensity divided by muscle signal intensity prior, upon completion, and 1 year after completion of neoadjuvant treatment. MRI was performed on average 80 days from the end of treatment. Statistical correlation between bone marrow index, age, disease stage, and time from the end of treatment. Results: The mean patient age was 50 and 98% were diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Bone marrow index prior to neoadjuvant treatment was 1.9, upon completion of treatment 3.5, and 1.4 at 1 year follow up. Age was found to be inversely correlated to bone marrow index, the bone marrow index was found to be significantly higher in women younger than 48y. No statistical correlation was found between the time of MRI from the end of treatment and disease stage. Conclusion: MRI bone marrow signal intensity may be high in women with breast cancer upon completion of NAT. It may be secondary to treatment with GCSF. This should not be confused with pathological enhancement suspicious of metastatic disease. Limitations: n\\a Ethics committee approval: n\\a Funding: No funding was received for this work. Author Disclosures: I. Bokov: nothing to disclose P. M. Sklair Levy: nothing to disclose D. M. Ben-David: nothing to disclose D. O. Haisraely: nothing to disclose Purpose: To investigate which MRI morphologic criteria can predict residual disease in ALNs in patients who have undergone NAC. Methods and materials: From 2017 to 2019, 60 consecutive patients with advanced breast cancer who underwent 1,5 T MRI before and after NAC were retrospectively collected. Pre-and post-NAC MRI were retrospectively analysed by two dedicated radiologists in consensus, blinded to histological results, evaluating both quantitative (number and diameter) and qualitative criteria (irregular margins, absence of fatty hilum, cortical thickness>3mm, perifocal oedema, rim enhancement, and asymmetry comparing with contralateral side) related to ALNs. ALNs status was evaluated by sentinel ALN biopsy or axillary dissection and nodal pathological response classified according to Pinder's criteria [complete response (pCR) versus no-complete response (no-pCR)]. Statistical analysis (Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables, non-parametric Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables) was performed to compare pCR versus no-pCR cases. Results: At baseline MRI, no-pCR cases ALNs were characterised by loss of fatty hilum (93.3% versus 44.4% in pCR, p=0.02), presence of rim enhancement (86.7% versus 11.1% in pCR, p=0.001), asymmetry (93.3% versus 44,4% in pCR, p=0.02), average cortical thickness significantly larger (9.5 versus 3.7 mm, p=0.004) than pCR cases. At post-NAC MRI, average cortical thickness was significantly (p=0.01) larger in no-pCR patients compared to pCR (4.5 versus 1.8 mm). Considering as suspicious ALN with at least one of the above characteristics, MRI sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy for assessing ALNs response were 88.2%, 77.8%%, 88.2%, 77.8%, and 84.6%, respectively. Conclusion: Based on our results, supporting the use of MRI in assessing nodal response after NAC, abnormal ALNs cortical thickness seems to be the most reliable parameter associated to no-pCR. Purpose: To investigate the diagnostic value of myocardial deformation analysis based on the 17-segment heart model using non-contrast enhanced (CE) 2D tissue feature tracking (2D-FT) technique. Methods and materials: 70 patients with suspected myocarditis underwent a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) examination at 1.5 Tesla. A contrastagent-free part of this CMR protocol was additionally performed in 40 healthy volunteers (HV). Besides standard CMR data sets, 2D-FT derived segmental and global longitudinal, radial, and circumferential deformation parameters were analysed. The 2D-FT results were compared to the combined findings from CMR imaging and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Results: Patients were assigned to 3 groups depending on their ejection fraction (EF) (<40%, 40-55%, and \u226555%). Compared to HV, impaired EF (<55%) was significantly correlated to reduced segmental and global strain and strain rate values. The circumferential deformation analysis was more sensitive to myocardial changes than longitudinal and radial analysis. The segmental strain/strain rate had an accuracy of 84.3%/70.0% for the diagnosis of acute myocarditis, stated by EMB and CMR in 42 of 70 patients. In patients with preserved EF, acute myocarditis could be ruled out using only segmental strain analysis with a negative predictive value of 87.5%. Conclusion: In patients with suspected myocarditis, the deformation analysis based on the 17-segment heart model provides valuable information about functional myocardial inhomogeneity. This quantitative approach could be used in addition to the clinical standard CMR protocol and represents a promising tool in the framework of a prospective automatised multiparametric CMR imaging analysis. Purpose: To investigate the predictive value of head and neck CT angiography (CTA) in intraoperative haemorrhage of carotid body tumours. Methods and materials: Head and neck CT images of 36 patients with carotid body tumours confirmed by pathology were retrospectively analyzed. The intraoperative bleeding volume \uff1c500 ml group and intraoperative bleeding volume \u2265500 ml group were compared and analysed. The patient's age, sex, Shamblin classification, size of the lesion, number of blood supply arteries, course of the disease, plain scan, and enhanced CT value were analysed. The ROC curve was established to determine the number of blood supply arteries, the maximum diameter of upper and lower, the longest diameter of the axis, and the sensitivity and specificity of the Shamblin type in judging the blood volume during the operation.",

            "text": "The amount of bleeding during the operation of carotid body tumours is related to the age of the patients, the maximum diameter of tumours, the longest diameter of axes, Shamblin classification, and the number of blood supply arteries. The AUC of the number of blood supply artery is larger than the other parameters, which can better predict intraoperative blood loss in patients with CBT. Conclusion: The number of blood supply artery detected in CTA is the best parameter to predict intraoperative blood loss. Purpose: To determine the effect of iterative metal artefact reduction (iMAR) technique in reducing dental metallic artefacts in head and neck CT examinations. Methods and materials: 30 patients with dental prosthesis implants were prospectively collected and the original data was reconstructed respectively in an iMAR group (Group A) and a conventional iterative reconstruction group (Group B). The CT and SD values of the two groups of images were measured respectively. The difference between the two groups was compared by a paired t-test.Results: There was no significant difference in CT values on the opposite side of the same layer without artefacts (P>0.05). The CT values in Group A were significantly reduced in the high-density artefact area (p<0.05), while significantly increased in the low-density artefact area (p<0.05), and were closer to the CT values in the corresponding anatomical areas at the opposite side of the same layer. In terms of image noise, SD values in each measurement area of group A's images were lower than those of group B and significantly lower in highdensity and low-density areas (p<0.05). In terms of subjective score, the results of the two groups of image evaluation are excellently consistent (Kappa=0.945, p<0.05). The subjective score of group A was significantly higher than that of the control group ( The numbers of LR-3, LR-4, LR-5, and LR-M categories were 16 (5.4%), 28 (9.5%), 183 (62.0%), and 68 (23.1%), and the positive predictive value (PPV) of LR-3, LR-4, and LR-5 was 43.8%, 60.7%, 98.4% for HCC, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the LR-5 category for HCC were 73.5%, 94.0%, and 98.4%. Conclusion: CEUS LI-RADS v2017 classification standard has reliable risk prediction value for patients with high-risk factors of HCC, which the LR-5 category has a higher positive predictive value for patients at risk of HCC. However, the differential diagnosis between HCC and other non-HCC malignancies still remains to be further studied for LR-M observations. Limitations: Due to the nature of the retrospective study, LR-1 and LR-2 categories nodules were not pathologically diagnosed and were not included in this study. Due to pathological reasons, the proportion of LR-3 category nodules in this study is relatively small, which may lead to selection bias. Ethics committee approval: n/ Purpose: The liver is the most common metastatic site for neuroendocrine neoplasms. Ultrasonography is widely used to detect focal liver lesions, but it is difficult to characterise hepatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (hNEN) from hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). We investigated the value of contrastenhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to distinguish hNEN from HCC in non-cirrhotic liver parenchyma. Methods and materials: From January 2014-June 2019, 92 patients who underwent liver CEUS examinations followed by a pathological diagnosis of neuroendocrine neoplasms in our institution were retrospectively evaluated in the study. At the same time, 92 patients with histologically-proven HCC without liver cirrhosis were randomly selected from the database as a control group. For each lesion, conventional ultrasound features and CEUS parameters, including enhancement pattern and washout time, were evaluated. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonic parameters for the differentiation of hNENs and HCCs was assessed using a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Results: hNEN and HCC showed significant differences in the number of nodules (P<0.001), enhancement level in portal phase (P<0.001), and the start of contrast washout time (P<0.001). Compared with HCCs, hNENs more often showed multiple lesions, less likely demonstrated iso-enhancement in the portal phase, and a quicker start of the contrast washout. When using the number of nodules and washout time on CEUS as the differential diagnosis of hNEN and HCC, the area under the ROC curve was 0. Purpose: To develop and validate a radiomics nomogram for the pretreatment prediction of transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) refractoriness with pre-therapeutic dynamic CT in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma without metastasis.",

A lasso regression model was used for radiomics signature selection and the selected signatures were validated using a Mann-Whitney U test. The radiomics nomogram was based on the multivariate logistic regression model incorporated the rad score (radiomics score), CT image factors (enhancement, homogeneous arterial, heterogeneous portal, capsule, Bilobar, and multiple), and clinical factors (age, sex, and logAFP). For optimising the radiomics nomogram, multiple backward stepwise elimination methods were investigated. We also evaluated the radiomics nomogram using ROC and a confusion matrix.

Predictors contained in the individualised prediction nomogram included rad score and Biolbar. The average age was 52\u00b121 and 43\u00b123 years in the first and second twin group, respectively. Concordance rates were higher in dizygotic than in monozygotic twins regarding anterior (0.47 and 0.22, respectively) and posterior (0.85 and 0.69, respectively) CoW variants. Cardiovascular risk factors did not differ significantly within monozygotic twin pairs discordant for CoW morphology (p>0.05 for body-mass index, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and smoking, respectively). Raw heritability of CoW haemodynamics was low to moderate (0.00-0.56). Conclusion: Our results support the dominance of environmental factors on both morphology and haemodynamics of the CoW. However, no cardiovascular risk factor was identified as a predictor of CoW variants. Consequently, our results stimulate further research aiming at specifying the environmental factors affecting CoW morphology. Limitations: Major limitations include small sample size, and low spatial resolution and flow-dependence of TOF-MRA.

Examination data of 410 patients included a history of HIV infection, opportunistic diseases, current CD4 count, plasma HIV RNA, pathogen identification in CSF. Statistic analysis included chi-square (with Yates correction), Fisher's, the Mann-Whitney, Wald criteria. Results: Regular ART was associated with a lower incidence of: large asymmetric lesions, caudate nuclei involvement, perilesional oedema, ring contrast enhancement. Duration of ART for more than five years reduces the incidence of brain involvement in HIV, contrast enhancement, white matter lesions, the involvement of the frontal lobes and basal nuclei. Lower current CD4 cells were associated with large asymmetric lesions, the involvement of the basal ganglia and posterior fossa, perilesional oedema and mass effect, blooming artefact on T2*, ring and nodular contrast enhancement. Plasma HIV RNA above 50 copies/ml was associated with diffuse white matter lesions, large asymmetric lesions, the involvement of the cerebellum, perilesional oedema. In major cases of CNS-IRIS we observed acute inflammatory demyelination, which was characterised by the appearance of new focal lesions, as well as the increase of old ones, atypical patterns of contrast enhancement: perivascular, peripheral, nodular, leptomeningeal. Conclusion: ART and dependent on its current \u0421D4 cells, plasma HIV RNA had an influence on the severity of brain structural damage. With the disease progression, the most vulnerable regions were basal ganglia and cerebellum despite ART. The atypical PML were significantly more often visualised in CNS-IRIS.

Wali, R. Ananthasivan, U. Acharya; Bangalore/ IN (drkrishna3thi23@gmail.com) Purpose: Comparing 3D DIR sequence with that of 3D FLAIR and 2D FLAIR sequence in order to find out the h sensitivity in the detection of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and in addition we would like to further evaluate which among the 3D sequences would have higher sensitivity and specificity in picking up demyelinating lesions in the brain. Methods and materials: Study population (minimum of 30 cases) will include patients who are being evaluated for demyelination disorders with MRI. Imaging was performed on a 3T Philips MR system using 3D DIR, 3D FLAIR sequences with the same parameters, including FOV, matrix, slice thickness, voxel size, and a number of signals averaging (NSA) in addition to routine T1, T2, diffusionweighted and 2D FLAIR. Results: Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis has been carried out in the present study. Results on continuous measurements are presented on mean \u00b1 SD (min-max) and results on categorical measurements are presented in number (%). Significance is assessed at 5 % level of significance. The following assumptions on data are made. Wilcoxon Signed rank test has been used to find the significance of the median score in two groups. Conclusion: DIR brain imaging had the highest sensitivity in the detection of supratentorial lesions compared to3D FLAIR and 2D flair. In addition, the lesions obtained with 3D DIR images were more easily visualised. Limitations: Patients with cardiac pacemakers and metallic implants will not be subjected to MRI. Motion disorder and claustrophobia, if severe, may make the examination difficult. Ethics committee approval: The study is approved by a diplomate of the national board. Purpose: We aimed to utilise a non-invasive in-vivo MR-based imaging modality and analysis framework to detect and characterise the laminar components of the human cerebral cortex in stroke and epilepsy patients compared with healthy controls (HC). Methods and materials: Using 3T-MRI we calculated T1-component probability maps and showed that the T1-signal of the cortex can be divided into 5-6 distinct Gaussian distributions centred at different values, which represent different cortical laminar classes. For the stroke patients, we explored in-vivo if in patients (n=20) with chronic lacunar infarct, involving the corticospinal-tracts (CST), the cortical layers of the connected primary motor cortex (M1) are differently affected. We performed tractography using the infarcts as the seed areas to reconstruct the CST and identified the connected M1. For epilepsy patients (focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH); n=9 each) we determined the laminar composition of 78 cortical regions of interest of the automated anatomical labelling (AAL) atlas, which was divided into 1000 sub-areas with equal volume. Results: For stroke patients we showed focal cortical thinning in the connected M1 and specifically only in its deepest laminar portion as compared to the nonaffected contralateral cortex (P<0.001), supporting the concept of secondary neurodegeneration. For epilepsy patients we found widespread cortical dyslamination compared to the HC, supporting evidences of epilepsy as a network disease with disrupted brain connectivity. Conclusion: Our findings provide a method to calculate and characterise the laminar architecture of the cortex, which was implemented to stroke and epilepsy patient groups. Our method may be used as a sensitive imaging biomarker, and could potentially elucidate pathophysiologic mechanisms and facilitate patient management towards developing individually tailored treatment.

You; Chengdu/ CN (1390178629@qq.com) Purpose: To explore the application of low-dose combined spectrum in CT scan of ischaemic stroke. Methods and materials: Group A (n=30) used the low-dose scan parameters: 80 kV, 50 mA, and the images were reconstructed by 50% ASIR-V. Head and neck (CTA) Scanning with Spectrum CT, 80-140 kV, 200 mA\uff0cthe contrast agent volume was 20ml and the flow rate was 4ml/s. The images were reconstructed with 40 keV and 80% ASIR-V. Group B (n=30) used routine scan parameter: CTP:80 kV, 150 mA, CTA :100 kV, 350 mA, the contrast agent volume was 50ml and the flow rate was 5ml/s. The images were reconstructed by FBP. The contrast agent volume was 40ml and the flow rate was 5ml/s in CTP. The quantitative evaluation included: CTP parameters of the hypothalamic, frontal and temporal lobes without perfusion defects at the basal ganglia level, the CT and SD values of the head-neck CTA segments, and the CNR values of M1. The CTP and CTA image quality were also subjectively evaluated by two senior radiologists using a four-point grading scale. Results: All CTP and CTA images were diagnostic. There were no significant differences in the subjective image, CTP parameters, CTA internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery and CT value of common carotid artery. There were significant differences in SD and CNR in the common carotid artery. The effective dose and the contrast agent in group A were 58.5% and 23% lower than group B. Conclusion: The use of low radiation dose combined spectrum and ASIR-V iterative reconstruction in CT scanning of ischaemic stroke. Limitations: The simple size is relatively small. Ethics committee approval: Approved by the ethics committee of our hospital. Purpose: The existence of the blood-brain barrier has led to almost all chemotherapeutic drugs and gene drugs failing to effectively achieve and play a role in glioblastoma. So far, the survival rate of glioblastoma patients has hardly improved. In this study, we are aimed to construct an integrated nanoprobe based on albumin nanoparticles for targeted diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma. Methods and materials: We constructed bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (ANG-BSA/Car/ICG MNPs) containing SPIO, carmustine and ICG coupled ANG. The in vitro and in vivo MRI/FL dual-mode imaging of glioblastomas in vitro and in vivo were systematically evaluated in order to evaluate the penetration ability of blood-brain barrier and tumour-specific targeting effect. At the same time, through experiments with the control group, we evaluated the ability of ANG-BSA/Car/ICG MNPs to inhibit tumour. Results: In vitro experiments, we verified that the targeting ability of nanoprobes to glioblastoma cells was significantly better than the control group. In addition, in vivo experiments, nanoprobes significantly increased the accumulation of brain tumours compared with the control group. This targeting imaging and drug delivery system provides an efficient strategy for targeted therapy and intraoperative localisation of glioblastoma. Conclusion: ANG-BSA/Car/ICG MNPs present a promising potential in multifunctional therapeutic of glioblastoma, and we anticipate that this nanoplatform will be a perfect candidate in glioblastoma theranostic. Limitations: This study was limited by the lack of comparison with other nanoplatforms. Ethics committee approval: All animal experiments were approved and conducted according to the principles of the Institutional Animal Care Committee from the Shenzhen Second People's Hospital. Imaging as the new yardstick for diagnosing peripheral mononeuropathies: a comparison between high-resolution ultrasound and MR neurography with an approach to diagnosis A. Agarwal Chandra, U. Jaipal, M. Bagarhatta, M. Agarwal, A. Chandra; Jaipur/ IN (a.agarwal.1992@gmail .com) Results: Overall, the diagnostic accuracy was highest for the proton density fat saturated (PDFS) MR sequence (93.89%) followed closely by HRUS (80%). The sensitivity was highest for PDFS sequence while the T1 MR sequence had the highest specificity. Combined diagnostic accuracy of both modalities was calculated to be 93.33% with a negative predictive value of 80%. HRUS and MRI equally detected the cases with nerve discontinuity, while neuromas were better identified on MRI. Conclusion: With the advent of higher frequency probes and improved MR field strength, imaging of peripheral nerves is possible with better accuracy. Imaging assessment of nerves allows anatomical delineation with the identification of the exact site of involvement. This comparative study demonstrates the role of imaging in diagnosing peripheral neuropathies with the accuracy of MRI as high as 93.89% which may serve as an imaging gold standard. HRUS, being quicker, cost-effective and a comparable accuracy of 80% can serve as a reliable screening tool. Limitations: Resource-limited setting and lack of newer sequences like DTI and DWI.

The processing pipeline includes two main components: (i) an image-derived input function (IDIF) component and (ii) a quantification component (QC). The IC component calculates an IDIF by first determining a volume-of-interest through automated segmentation of the MRA, followed by MR navigator-based motion correction (MC) and an MR-based partial volume correction (PVC). The QC then uses the IDIF to generate CMRGlc images. To validate the pipeline, 10 healthy volunteers underwent [18F]FDG test-retest PET/MRI examinations in an integrated PET/MR. Arterial blood samples (AIF) were collected as a reference standard. Pseudo-CT images derived from T1-w MR were used for AC. Absolute percentage difference (APD) in regional MRGlc values (IDIF vs AIF) were determined in the following 6 brain regions: corpus callosum (CC), brainstem (BS), cerebellum (CB), thalamus (TH), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the superior frontal cortex (SFC). Results: The APD between CMRGlc values obtained from AIF and IDIF were: (5.9 \u00b13.2%) for CC, (5.9 \u00b13.3%) for BS, (5.8 \u00b13.4%) for CB, (5.5 \u00b13.1%) for ACC, (5 Value of routine T2WI histogram in differential diagnosis of glioblastoma Z.

Purpose: To compare the characteristics of different types of spontaneous intracranial artery dissection on high-resolution MRI (HR-MRI) vessel wall imaging. Methods and materials: Fifty-six patients with approved spontaneous intracranial artery dissection were scanned on a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner with pre-and post-contrast 3D T1-weighted SPACE. Patients were divided into four groups based on the morphological characteristics of pre-contrast 3D T1weighted SPACE imaging. Type 1 corresponded to classic dissecting aneurysms, type 2 aneurysms were segmental ectasias, type 3 aneurysms were dolichoectatic dissecting aneurysms and type 4 aneurysms were saccular aneurysms unrelated to the branching zones. Consistency of clinical staging (acute, subacute, chronic stage) and imaging types was evaluated. The characteristics of spontaneous intracranial artery dissection were evaluated including intraluminal contrast enhancement, and artery wall enhancement (grade 0, similar to that of normal vessel walls; grade 1, less than or similar to that of muscle; and grade 2, greater than that of muscle). The characteristics of spontaneous intracranial artery dissection were compared among different types. Results: Of the 56 aneurysms, 48 were located in the vertebrobasilar system, and the other eight aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation. There were 22 patients for type 1, 10 for type 2, 14 for type 3, and 10 for type 4. Patients were classified into acute (n=18), subacute (n=18), and chronic (n=20) stages according to the time intervals from symptom onset. The clinical staging was in good consistency with imaging types (p=0.000, r=0.732). There was significantly different of intraluminal contrast enhancement and vessel wall enhancement among the four types groups (p=0.030). Conclusion: The 3T HR-MRI reveals the vessel wall characteristics and provides distinguishing findings between different types of spontaneous intracranial artery dissection.

Tian: nothing to disclose X. Tian: nothing to disclose Z. Shi: nothing to disclose J. Lu: nothing to disclose Purpose: Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is a brain tumour developed in 10-26% of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Since they are located near the foramen of Monro, SEGAs can cause obstructive hydrocephalus, leading to increase morbidity and mortality. It is recommended to follow TSC patients with contrast-enhanced (CE) MRIs, but the repetitive use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) may cause gadolinium deposits. Our aim was to compare the performance of CE and non-CE MRI to diagnose SEGA. Methods and materials: Thirty-five TSC patients were enrolled in this retrospective single-centre study from September 2007 to January 2019 (15/35 (43%) males and 20/35 (57%) females). The inclusion criteria were: diagnosis of TSC on clinical and genetic arguments (according to international TSC consensus conference held in 2012) and at least three-brain MRIs performed for follow-up with a contrast agent injection. In total, 70 MRIs were selected (25 MRIs in the SEGA group and 65 MRIs in the non-SEGA group), two consecutive MRIs per patient were anonymised. Three radiologists performed a doubleblinded review of the non-CE and CE MRI sequences. The diagnostic performances were calculated (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values and inter and intra-observer agreements). Results: The performances for the detection of SEGA were good and similar between the CE and non-CE MRIs. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for the two groups (range of Kappa coefficient: 0.81-0.93, p<0.001). The size of nodules near the Monro foramen, intense and heterogeneous contrast enhancement and modifications between two consecutive MRI were significantly associated with the presence of SEGA. Conclusion: The performances of CE and non-CE MRIs are similar and excellent for detecting SEGA, raising the question of reducing unnecessary gadolinium-chelates injection for TSC patients.

Role of transcranial ultrasound with Doppler and strain elastography in neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy with magnetic resonance imaging as the gold standard A. Singh, U. Jaipal, D. A. Bhandari; Jaipur/IN (DrAsthaSingh@outlook.com) Purpose: To compare and correlate the diagnostic role of neurosonography with spectral Doppler and strain elastography in neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy with MRI as the gold standard. To assess the role of diffusionweighted Imaging in early identification and extent of ischemic injury. Methods and materials: A prospective study was conducted on 50 patients under one month age with a clinical picture of neonatal encephalopathy, a history of perinatal asphyxia and low Apgar score. All patients were graded by Sarnat and Sarnat grading. Neurosonography with spectral Doppler of the anterior cerebral artery and strain elastography was done with 3-7 MHz probe on anterior fontanelle. Elastographic scores were assigned on a five-point colour scale.3 Tesla MRI was done with DWI (diffusion-weighted images). Ultrasound findings were correlated with MRI in various areas of the brain parenchyma and the role of DWI was evaluated by SPSS v.20.0. Results: The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of neurosonography compared to MRI were 82%, 82.6% and 75% respectively. DWI detected mild ischaemic changes when other MR sequences were negative. Neurosonography detected all cases of germinal matrix haemorrhage and showed better sensitivity for thalamic, basal ganglia and periventricular white matter lesions. Altered RI values of ACA were seen in 59% of moderate and severe cases. Diagnostic accuracy of Elastographic score was 76.67% with a specificity of 86.67% (95%CI;59.54%-98.34%) and sensitivity of 66.67% (95%CI;33.38%-88.18%). Conclusion: Neurosonography is an effective screening tool for detecting ischaemic encephalopathy. Raised elasticity of periventricular white matter in neonatal encephalopathy points towards its promising role in early diagnosis. DWI detects ischaemic changes earlier than conventional MRI which is important in initiating early management. Limitations: This study was limited by its small sample size.

            "text": "A total of 33 patients with a diagnosis of cerebral hemiatrophy at our institution between January 2012 to July 2019 were retrospectively review. Patients of this study must fulfil the following criteria: (i) clinical presentation of seizure; (ii) radiological manifestations with ipsilateral sulcal enlargement, ipsilateral lateral ventricular dilatation, and ipsilateral calvarial thickening. The patients were distributed into two groups based on the present or absent of childhood head injury. Clinical and imaging characteristics were compared and analysed. Raw data are presented as frequencies and percentages for categories and mean for the age at presentation. Fisher's exact test was used to assess the association between two categorical variables. Results: There are 14 patients (eight males, six females) aged 1 to 46 years (mean age\u00b1SD=20.7\u00b113.8) were included. There are eight patients with childhood head injury and six patients without history of childhood head injury. Clinical features recognised in these two groups are hemiplegia (87.5% vs 66.7% respectively, p=0.539), mental retardation (87.5% vs 66.7%,p=0.539) and psychiatric disorders (37.5% vs 16.7%, p=0.580). Of these patients, radiological appearances of wallerian degeneration and hyperpneumatisation of paranasal sinus (75% vs 50%, p=0.580 ); elevation of orbital roof (75% vs 33.3%,p= 0.277); hperpneumatisation of the mastoid and elevation of petrous ridge (62.5% vs 16.7%, p=0.138) were found in these two groups. The formation of porencephaly Conclusion: The clinical-radiological manifestations of DDMS vary widely. The patients with childhood head injury were more likely to have the formation of porencephaly and midline structural shifts. Limitations: This study was limited by a small number of patients and by the lack of detailed history and clinical information due to the retrospective nature of this study. Ethics committee approval: n/a Funding: No funding was received for this work. For objective image quality, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise (SNR) of two MRA images were compared. The subjective image quality was assessed using a 5-point score scale by two experienced observers and the interobserver agreement was determined. With DSA as the reference, the neck, height, and width of aneurysms in two MRAs were measured and compared on maximum intensity projection (MIP) image datasets, respectively. Purpose: We proposed a new index of haemodynamic severity of atherosclerotic stenosis of carotid arteries: gradient of narrowing of arterial lumen GNL={(Snorm-Sstenosis )/Dnorm-stenosis}, mm 2 /mm, i.e. as ratio of difference between the areas of cross-sections of the artery at the levels of most prominent stenosis and of normal non.stenosed artery closest to it, to the distance between them. Methods and materials: 25 patients were studied, all with a stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) >50%, (ECST), mono (n=22), or bilateral (n=3). 11 people without ICA stenosis served as the control group. In all participants, MRangiography was carried out, with the calculation of the GNL on the ICA stenoses. Brain MRI was also carried out on all participants in \u04221-, \u04222-, PD-, and flair-weighted protocols. Results: Patients were assigned to group 1 (n=12, without brain damages), and group 2 (n=13, evidence of earlier ischaemic damages Purpose: To explore intracerebral perfusion and territory shifts conducted by each main artery in Moyamoya disease pre-and post-surgery. Methods and materials: 27 MMD patients underwent non-enhanced 3D t-ASL, 3D-TOF MRA, and 3D pCASL within one week before and after surgery. T-ASL maps and perfusion shifts of unilateral ICA and bilateral VA were obtained. Perfusion shifts were further subdivided and compared according to MRA. T-ASL images were coregistered to each ASL-CBF maps and created into binary masks. The CBF value was extracted by ASL-CBF maps and all these masks, respectively. A paired t-test was used to compare the surgical side, non-surgical side ICA-CBF, and bilateral VA-CBF, respectively, pre-and post-surgery. Independent two samples t-test was used to compare territorial CBF and its changes before surgery between the haemorrhagic group and the ischaemic group. Results: 27 (7 haemorrhagic, 13 ischaemic) were enrolled. 4 distinct categories of perfusion territory shifts were observed on t-ASL. Perfusion territory shifts were divided into 2 categories. 7 perfusion territory shifts vanished and 6 appeared after surgery, including both 2 categories. There were significant CBF improvement in the surgical side ICA territory ( Purpose: In Marfan patients, accurate aortic diameter measurements are crucial for life-long monitoring. We compared the influence of overall image quality, amount of image artefacts, contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR), and aortic root surgery on the reliability of aortic measurements of non-contrast MRA in Marfan patients at 1.5T and 3T. Methods and materials: 40 Marfan patients were prospectively evaluated by non-contrast 2D-bSSFP MRA of the aorta at 1.5T and after 12 months at 3T before (n=24) and after aortic surgery (n=16). Two readers independently rated the image quality and the presence/amount of artefacts on Likert scales at 9 (8) aortic levels before (after) aortic surgery. The CNR of the delineated aortic wall was separately calculated for each aortic level. Results: Aortic imaging at 3T provided significantly superior CNR and more reproducible aortic diameters compared to 1.5T. Interobserver variances of aortic measurements were significantly smaller at the sinuses of the valsalva, sinotubular junction, mid-ascending aorta, and proximal descending aorta in presurgical patients (p<0.05). After aortic surgery, the majority of the advantages of 3T were mitigated by a significantly impaired image appearance due to the higher number of susceptibility/flow artefacts at 3T compared with 1.5T. This resulted in significantly higher aortic diameter variances at the mid-graft and distal anastomosis. Purpose: To automate the scan range delimitation in topograms of chest CT exams using deep learning techniques. Automation of this process would free the radiographer from this routine task and could potentially reduce the radiation exposure for the patient due to a stronger restriction of the scan range. Methods and materials: A total of 1,150 chest topograms of patients (mean age=64.6 years) with pleural effusion (N=360), with atelectasis (N=82), with both diseases (N=21), or without both diseases (N=411) were extracted retrospectively from our PACS, and the scan range was delimitated in each topogram by two radiologists in consensus. A conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) for image-to-image translation was trained on 1,000 topograms to generate virtual scan range delimitations. Quantitative evaluation was performed on 150 randomly selected topograms by computing the absolute difference of the predicted scan delimitations and those of the two expert radiologists. Results: Automated scan range delimitation showed an excellent agreement with the scan range delimitation of the radiologists. The mean absolute difference between expert radiologists and the prediction of the neural network was 3.77 +/-0.74 mm and 5.87 +/-1.29 mm at the upper and lower limit, respectively. Conclusion: An automated scan range delimitation of chest CT scans using deep learning techniques was trained and evaluated by comparing the scan range with the annotations of two senior radiologists. The results indicate that the conditional generative adversarial network can generate scan range delimitations that are comparable to those of expert radiologists. Limitations: More training data could potentially increase overall performance. Purpose: In the quest for increasing image quality, MR throughput can suffer and manoeuvre, which creates faster scans trade-off quality. There is a need to enhance images without prolonging scan time. Recently, deep learning-based reconstruction methods have shown promise to enhance image value. We evaluated the impact of a new deep learning image reconstruction (DLR) method for both noise reduction and improved image sharpness in clinical MR exams of the brain and spine.",

K-space data was reconstructed with both conventional and DLR (tuned to 75% noise reduction). Two neuroradiologists independently rated 93 pairs of conventional and DLR images side-by-side. Ratings were based on overall IQ, lesion conspicuity, perceived SNR and resolution, CNR, image texture, and artefact using a 5-point Likert scale (5=excellent, 1=non-diagnostic). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the ratings and inter-rater reliability between readers was assessed using the Bennett S score. Purpose: To investigate the effect of a deep learning image reconstruction algorithm on image quality in chest CT scans. Methods and materials: With institutional ethics approval, 100 consecutive patients underwent chest CT at standard radiation doses on a 320-detector row CT scanner with the following scan parameters: Helical scan, 0.5 mm x 80 detector rows, 120 or 100kV, and automatic exposure control, 0.275s rotation speed and standard pitch. Each scan was reconstructed at 0.5 mm volume and 3 mm axial, coronal, and sagittal slices with both lung and soft tissue kernels using the clinical standard hybrid IR (AIDR3D) and deep learning reconstruction (AiCE) techniques. Images were evaluated for overall image quality, noise, presence of artefacts, contrast, visibility of small structures, and diagnostic confidence using a 4-point Likert scale. SNR and CNR were calculated for each reconstruction.

Purpose: To evaluate the clinical benefits on image quality (IQ) of TrueFidelity, a deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR), in multiphasic liver CT compared to adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction V (ASIRV) in patients and on a phantom. Methods and materials: 66 patients underwent a multiphasic liver CT during a 1-month-period. The protocol was tailored according to patient morphology: 80 kV for a body mass index (BMI) <25; 100 kV for 25<BMI<30, and 120 kV for BMI>30. IQ of patient images reconstructed with DLIR and ASIRV50 was assessed on portal phase by measuring liver parenchyma contrast and signalto-noise ratios (CNR, SNR), and qualitatively by two radiologists using a 5-point Likert-scale. Phantom images acquired with similar protocols were evaluated by computing the noise power spectrum and the task-based modulation transfer function (MTFtask). Results: Compared to ASIRV50, CNR and SNR were significantly improved with DLIR by 71% and 56% at 80, 83% and 77% at 100, and 61% and 60% at 120 kV, respectively (p<0.01 or less). Qualitative IQ was also improved with DLIR for each patient morphology (p<0.0001). On the phantom, compared to ASIRV50, DLIR reduced the noise magnitude by 31% at 80, 100, and 120kV while maintaining a coarser texture (noise mean frequency was 0. Evaluation of automated quality control of multicentre clinical trial CT data using spine localisation based on a machine learning method S. Lee 1 , C. Page 2 , P. Galette 3 , P. Murphy 2 , B. Glocker 1 ; 1 London/UK, Purpose: Consistent image quality across multiple centres in clinical trials is crucial. The quality control is typically done by centralising data followed by manual checks prior to radiological review. For evaluating the feasibility of automating the QC process, we developed a software tool, Automatic Visual Quality Control (AutoVQC), that automatically locates the spine, calculates the anatomical field of view (FOV), and detects imaging artefacts using machine learning.

The QC outcome was reviewed and classified as true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative, where positive and negative indicate QC pass and artefacts, respectively. Results: AutoVQC returned the spine localisation result within one minute per series. The result was reviewed for sufficient data quality for subsequent analyses and accurate corresponding canonical body axis range. From all 459 series evaluated, accuracy 0.93, precision 0.89, recall 0.98, and specificity 0.87 were achieved.

            "text": "We considered 3 different features of the image quality: inclusion, rotation, and inspiration. The inclusion was further divided into 4 edges: sin, dex, top, and bottom. The data comprised of 2,019 posteroanterior chest radiographs in an upright position. We annotated the images based on the European Commission's guidelines on quality criteria for diagnostic radiographic images. The inclusion criteria were divided into three classes: too tight, correct, and too wide. The rotation and inspiratory were divided into two classes: ok and not ok. We increased the amount of the image data for the inclusion by cropping the correct images to meet the too-tight criteria and for the inclusion and the rotation by flipping the images horizontally. The image histograms were equalized and the images were resized to a resolution of 512x512 pixels. Approximately 100 and 200 images were extracted for validation and test data, respectively. We trained ResNet50 and DenseNet121 networks with the remaining images. Results: Resnet50 and Densenet121 both performed accurately for the inclusion detection in sin-and dex-edges. Densenet121 performed better for the inclusion detection in top-and bottom-edges as well as in the patient rotation and inspiration detection. The AUC was > 0.92 for the inclusion detection in all four edges in three classes. The AUC was > 0.71 and > 0.89 for the rotation and the inspiration, respectively. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence can be used in a clinical setting as instant feedback of the chest radiograph image-quality. Additionally, the trained networks provide a tool for long-term quality control of a radiography unit. Limitations: Data from only one centre was used. Ethics committee approval: n/a Funding: No funding was received for this work. Purpose: Preprocessing CT material density images is a common step for noise reduction, which improves diagnostic image quality. Our study aimed to determine the utility of adaptive artificial intelligence (AI)-based preprocessing for adjusting parameters across each CT slice compared to a similar \"fixed\" AIbased version that applies the same parameters across all slices. We hypothesised that the adaptive AI-based approach would decrease noise levels across different imaging exams more than the fixed approach. Methods and materials: This retrospective single-site observational study used head (n=569) and lung-nodule screening (n=276) CT exams acquired over the month prior to analysis on 64-MDCT scanners at standard-dose parameters.Original data was reconstructed as thin-section CT: 1) without preprocessing, 2) with fixed AI-based preprocessing, and 3) with adaptive AI-based preprocessing.The noise was computed as the dependent variable in each case using a manually coded software script and between-group analyses was conducted.Results: There was a significant (p<0.05) between-group reduction in noise level variation, with decreases in noise for the AI-processed compared to the non-processed CT data and greater for the adaptive versus fixed AI-based algorithm. In particular, the standard deviation (SD) for the mean noise was markedly lower for the adaptive versus fixed AI-based algorithm, indicating decreases in image variability across scans.",
