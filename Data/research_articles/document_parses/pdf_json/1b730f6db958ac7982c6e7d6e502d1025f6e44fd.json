First we examined at county-to-county comparisons by NPI level (Table 1) . For each county we performed a t-test to examine whether R e at NPI level n is statistically different from R e at level n + 1. Here, level 0 corresponds to no interventions, level 1 corresponds to low level NPIs, level 2 corresponds to medium level NPIs, and level 3 is high level NPIs. Note, sample sizes are small for lower levels as we required at least five days in each level to compare transmission estimates. Second, we examine whether mean values of R e at level n are associated with transmission reduction associated with moving to level n + 1 ( Table 2 ). In other words, we address whether transmission reduction will be greater if starting values of R e are greater. Across counties, we find the mean R e without NPIs is 3.4, the mean at low level NPIs is 2.6, the mean at medium level NPIs is 1.9 and the average at the highest NPI level is 1.3. This suggests, on average, that counties did not obtain R e values below one. Table 1 shows the largest gains are observed for moving from no NPIs (level 0) to low level NPIs (level 1). Briefly, these include limits on large (500-1000 people) gatherings and partial school closures. In contrast, we observed the smallest average gain as well as the least consistent statistical significance for moving from medium (level 2) restrictions to high (level 3) restrictions. This implies two possible explanations: the first is that marginal gains are more difficult when R e becomes low. So while it may take relatively small changes to move from R e = 3 to R e = 2, it may be much harder to achieve R e = 1 from R e = 2; second, it may imply that prohibiting large gatherings (also known as \"superspreader events\") gives the largest gain in transmission reduction relative to other measures [19] . To further investigate these two hypotheses we turn to Table 2  Table 2 explores how the slope (or change in R e ) varies depending on the baseline R e value. We see a consistent We see that a number of states in the south and west did not obtain large reductions in R e when moving to the highest NPI level. Red outlines indicate states which had case increases of greater than 50% in the two weeks between June 8 and June 22, 2020. States like Texas, Florida, and Georgia are, at the time of this writing, seeing a drastic spike in cases. These results indicate that conditions for increasing cases existed as much as a month ago, at the tail end of \"stay home\" orders. We see great variability across states in the average reduction in transmission associated with each level. The increasing values of the coefficients in Table 2 as we move from model (1) to model (3) support the first hypothesis, that gains from adding additional regulations are larger for larger R e values and obtaining slower transmission becomes increasingly difficult as lower values of R e are reached.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1934, "end": 1938, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 174, "end": 183, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 743, "end": 750, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1132, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 2012, "text": "Table 2  Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2766, "end": 2773, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Policy Changes and Transmission Reduction"}, {"text": "T-tests for the difference in R e distributions across counties and days (which also includes mean R e values for each level) are included in the supplement.
