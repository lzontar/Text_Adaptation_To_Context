Compared with the situation where only local movement or individual-based linkage exists, the coexistence of them leads to a wider spread of infectious disease. The roles of narrowing segregated spatial domain and reducing mobility in epidemic control are checked, these two measures are found to be conducive to curbing the spread of infectious disease. Considering heterogeneous time scales between local movement and global interaction, a log-log relation between the change in the number of infected individuals and the timescale \u03c4 is found. A theoretical analysis indicates that the evolutionary dynamics in the present model is related to the encounter probability and the encounter time. A functional relation between the epidemic threshold and the ratio of shortcuts, and a functional relation between the encounter time and the timescale \u03c4 are found.",

In the SIS model, each individual is initially in one of the two states: S (susceptible) and I (infected). A susceptible individual may become infected as he encounters an infected individual, and an infected individual may become susceptible again after some time. In the SIR model, each individual is initially in one of the three states: S, I and R (recovered). The only difference between the SIS model and the SIR model is that, in the SIR model, an infected individual firstly becomes healthy (recovered), when he is immune to the disease. After some time, the recovered individual may become susceptible to the disease again.",

An individual may move about aimlessly like a floating boat in the ocean or travel along a certain path like a move on the chessboard. Two individuals may interact with each other day after day because they are in the same firm or only have a chance encounter because neither of them likes establishing a fixed relationship with any other people. To understand the roles of underlying structure in the evolution of collective behaviors, different network models are usually borrowed to simulate the mobility patterns and the interaction patterns [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] . The existing network models can be classified into two families: the network with a single layer, including regular network, random network and scale-free network [16, 17, 18, 19] , and the network with multiple-layers [20, 21, 22, 23] , which consists of two or more sub-networks.",

However, in the real world, the evolutionary dynamics in reaction-diffusion systems is usually determined by the coupling of mobility and connectivity, especially the group dynamics in social and economic systems [37, 38, 39, 40, 41] . For example, a susceptible individual may be infected by an unknown individual in a random walk after dinner or be infected by a business partner. The coupled effects of random walk and pre-arranged interaction on contagion are short of in-depth study. In relation to the measures for disease control and prevention, most of the studies focus on the effects of immunization and isolation, which especially rely on the knowledge of one's activity routine and one's friendship network. Generally speaking, compared with the route of random walk, a predefined interaction structure is much easier to be understood. In view of the coupling of random walk and predefined interaction structure, the effect of local activity restriction on global epidemic suppression is worth extra attention.",

The effects of activity domain restriction and mobility restriction on epidemic control are extensively investigated. When the global interaction is restricted, both narrowing the segregated spatial domain and reducing local mobility can effectively curb the spread of epidemic. The existence of far away connection makes the epidemic control methods become less effective. A theoretical analysis indicates that the effectiveness of activity restriction on epidemic control depends on the change in average encounter probability and the change in average encounter time.
