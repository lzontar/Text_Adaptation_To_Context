Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) confers additional risks to healthcare workers due to exposure to aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) like chest compressions, face mask ventilation and intubation. The emergent and high-intensity situation may also result in lapses in infection control practices 1 . High-fidelity simulation sessions were conducted in our institution to identify latent threats in existing workflows, and to formulate modified life support protocols focusing on: protection of healthcare workers (HCW) and patients, minimizing aerosolization and reducing delays in resuscitation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "To the Editor"}, {"text": "Sengkang General Hospital, one of Singapore's largest regional hospitals, comprises an acute care 1000-bedded facility and a 400-bedded community care hospital. Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are managed in negative pressure, single-bedded rooms in the acute care hospital. In the community hospital, such patients are managed in cohort wards (4-6 bedded bays) with natural cross ventilation through large open windows. A single code blue team, based at the acute hospital, provides resuscitation services at both facilities. Due to geographical reasons, the mean (SD) code blue response time to the acute and community care wards were 3.28 (1.76) and 6.67 (2.06) minutes, respectively.

The mean (SD) time taken by 19 HCW during simulations, for donning full PPE including CleanSpace \u00ae PAPR was 3.33 (0.73) minutes.

These include use of waterproof shields or partitions to cordon off the resuscitation area, prompt evacuation of ambulant patients and minimizing aerosol generating procedures. Due to the potential delay in response times, manual ventilation via SAD 2 (preferred if HCW is trained and competent in SAD insertion) or a well-fitting mask with a good seal may be required prior to code blue team arrival.
