Typically, HAdV-B species (types 3, 7, 12, 14, and 55) , HAdV-C (types 1, 2, 5, and 6), and HAdV-E (type 4) are closely associated with respiratory tract infections [Metzger et al., 2007; Kajon et al., 2010; Walsh et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2013] . Identification of serotypes is important because the pathogenesis of HAdV infection is determined mainly by serotypes. Based on nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the hypervariable region in the hexon gene, phylogenetic analysis has been used for the clustering and typing of HAdVs [Crawford-Miksza and Schnurr, 1996a; Biere and Schweiger, 2010] . Accordingly, phylogenetic analysis can facilitate molecular epidemiological investigations of HAdV outbreaks.",

In the same context, respiratory HAdV infections can be identified from patients with an upper respiratory tract infection throughout the entire year, with an average detection rate of 4% in Korea [Lee et al., 2010] . However, in 2010-after a major H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009-an outbreak of HAdV infections occurred in Korea. This study aimed to identify the major type of HAdV involved through direct PCR amplification followed by hexon gene sequence analysis. The public health impact based on clinical features of the outbreak is also emphasized. This is believed to be the first report of a nationwide outbreak of respiratory adenovirus infections in Korea.",

Specimens were placed in virus transport medium (BD, Sparks, MD) and sent to 17 local institutes of health and environmental research maintained at 4\u02daC to be tested for major respiratory viruses including HAdVs. The remained samples were stored at \u00c070\u02daC until use. Because an abnormally high positive rate of HAdV was observed nationwide from July 2010 until the end of the year, all positive cases (n \u00bc 1,007) of HAdVs were selected and then subjected to differentiate serotypes retrospectively. To compare any difference in HAdV prevalence between the pre-and postpandemic phases, 91 samples of nasal aspirates taken in 2008 before the H1N1 influenza pandemic were collected through the acute respiratory infection network. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Korean National Institute of Health (Approval # 2008; 2012 -09CON-03-4C, 2010 ; 2010-03EXP-1-R).",

Even though HAdVs have DNA as their genetic material, recombination is very frequently reported for this virus, which could be important for HAdV evolution resulting in shifts in its pathology and virulence [Craford-Miksza and Schnurr, 1996b; Walsh et al., 2009; Rebelo-de-Andrade et al., 2010] . One recent report indicated that recombinant HAdVs introduced into the community could produce highly virulent strains with epidemic and lethal potential [Halstead et al., 2010] . Therefore, there might be a limit to explaining the relationship between clinical manifestations and HAdV infections through PCRbased molecular typing targeting just one gene.

One possibility is there was a micro-environmental change in hosts following the pandemic era. As presented in this study, the outbreak caused by HAdV-3 following the pandemic era seemed not to be associated with specific changes in the viral hexon gene, which is known to encode major antigenic sites of HAdV. Instead, extensive changes in the overall host population's immune status resulting from the primary introduction of H1N1 influenza into the community could have mediated this unusually high incidence of HAdV. There was no significant changes were observed in the HAdV genome supports this hypothesis. The other possibility is that the original introduction of HAdV could lead to fluctuations in population immunity triennially, regardless of the influence of the influenza pandemic. During the preparation of this manuscript, repetitive HAdV outbreaks caused by HAdV-3 were also detected in 2013 (data not shown). Again, no significant mutations were observed using hexon sequence analysis targeting randomly sampled HAdV-3 viruses. This repetitive outbreak caused by the HAdV-3 suggests that when HAdV-3 was the major circulating virus, population immunity might have been diluted. Thus, newborn infants might be a newly susceptible group to HAdV-3 and this might have contributed to the triennial outbreak of HAdV-3 infection. To validate this hypothesis, a birth cohort-derived seroepidemiological study targeting specific antibodies against HAdVs should be carried out to test the present data further.",
