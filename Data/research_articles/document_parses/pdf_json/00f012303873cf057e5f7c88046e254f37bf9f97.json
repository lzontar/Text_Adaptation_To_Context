Protein profiles of Golgi-enriched fractions isolated from S. typhimurium-infected cells were compared with those of mock-infected cells, revealing significant depletion or enrichment of 105 proteins. Proteins annotated to play a role in membrane traffic were overrepresented among the depleted proteins whereas proteins annotated to the cytoskeleton showed a diverse behavior with some proteins being enriched, others being depleted from the Golgi fraction upon Salmonella infection. To study the functional relevance of identified proteins in the Salmonella infection cycle, small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments were performed. siRNA-mediated depletion of a selection of affected proteins identified five host factors involved in Salmonella infection. Depletion of peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6), isoform b-4c of integrin b-4 (ITGB4), isoform 1 of protein lap2 (erbin interacting protein; ERBB2IP), stomatin (STOM) or TBC domain containing protein 10b (TBC1D10B) resulted in increased Salmonella replication. Surprisingly, in addition to the effect on Salmonella replication, depletion of STOM or ITGB4 resulted in a dispersal of intracellular Salmonella microcolonies.

Salmonella can also enter the bloodstream when they are taken up by dendritic cells that are present at the basolateral side of the intestinal epithelium [6] . The infection of epithelial cells is a crucial step in Salmonella infection. The bacterium invades this type of cells by inducing its own uptake.

These effector proteins modify host cell functions to the benefit of the bacterium. The T3SSs are encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1 and SPI-2; for reviews, see [7, 8, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] ). To enable Salmonella's invasion of epithelial cells, the SPI-1-encoded T3SS of the bacterium translocates effectors across the plasma membrane of the epithelial cell. Among others, these effectors cause actin rearrangements, which induce ruffling of host cell's plasma membrane and uptake of the Salmonella by macropinocytosis [17] [18] [19] [20] . Once inside the host cell, the bacterium resides in a so-called Salmonellacontaining vacuole (SCV). The SPI-2-encoded T3SS, T3SS-2, translocates effector proteins across the membrane of the SCV into host cell's cytoplasm to promote intracellular survival and replication of Salmonella. In order for Salmonella to replicate, the SCV moves to the perinuclear region where it becomes surrounded by membranes of the Golgi apparatus. During the migration to the Golgi region, the SCV matures and recruits several markers from the endo/lysosomal system by interacting with the endocytic and secretory pathway (for extensive reviews on SCV maturation and biogenesis, see [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] ). Three T3SS-2 effectors, SifA, SseF and SseG, were shown to be important for the maintenance of the SCV in the Golgi region [27] [28] [29] [30] . Although there is no evidence for a direct contact between Salmonella and the Golgi apparatus, it has been shown that intact Golgi membranes are required for efficient Salmonella replication. Drug-induced disruption of the Golgi apparatus has been demonstrated to decrease Salmonella replication [29] . In addition to positioning itself in the Golgi region during replication, S. typhimurium can also redirect host secretory traffic. This results in the accumulation of exocytic cargo vesicles (post-Golgi vesicles) in close proximity of the SCV [31] . Thus, during infection, Salmonella interacts with the host cell secretory pathway in several ways. However, the details of these interactions and the host proteins involved are largely unknown.

In a previous report [33] we applied SILAC-based quantitative proteomics to investigate coronavirus-host interactions.

Proteins annotated to be localized to several cellular compartments were found in the Golgi-enriched fraction. This is not unexpected as our Golgi isolation procedure is based on established protocols that show a maximal 52-fold enrichment of Golgi markers, with a 1-4-fold enrichment of protein markers from other organelles [35] [36] [37] . Of note, proteins localizing primarily in other organelles than the Golgi may very well also be present in the Golgi, albeit at lower levels. We identified 765 proteins in the Golgi-enriched fraction from which 105 were affected upon Salmonella infection. From Figs. 2 and 3 it is clear that Salmonella infection affected proteins from several different groups. Proteins predicted to associate with the cytoskeleton/annotated to the CYT function group (Figs. 2 and 3) were consistently affected. This is in agreement with several reports showing that Salmonella infection affects the cytoskeleton during entry and movement to the Golgi region in order to establish a replicating niche [17, 28, [46] [47] [48] . Some of the affected CYT proteins in the Golgi-enriched fraction were increased in abundance, whereas others were decreased. It remains to be established whether a change in the location of a cytoskeleton-associated protein is initiated either by Salmonella to promote its replication, or by the host cell to elicit an immune response. In addition, proteins annotated to the membrane traffic group, mainly predicted to localize to the Golgi apparatus/ endosomes, were consistently affected upon Salmonella infection. The majority of those proteins were depleted from the Golgi fraction upon Salmonella infection. The depletion of these affected proteins from the Golgi region upon Salmonella infection might be the result of relocation of these proteins away from the Golgi either induced by the bacterium for its own benefit or by the host cell as a defense mechanism. Our preliminary data (RT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels in uninfected vs infected cells) indicated that the affected proteins are not down regulated, suggesting that the change in their abundance in the Golgi more likely results from altered membrane dynamics/protein relocation than from altered protein degradation/altered gene expression (data not shown). These data were confirmed by comparison of protein levels (STOM, TBC1D10B and PRDX6) in PNS of uninfected versus infected cells using Western blot analysis (Fig. 5) . The results showed that at least for STOM, TBC1D10B and PRDX6 the cellular protein expression level did not change upon infection and suggest that relocation of these proteins is a likely cause of depletion or enrichment in the Golgi-enrieched fraction.

In addition to the effect of these five proteins on Salmonella replication, depletion of STOM or ITGB4 resulted in a dispersal of the Salmonella microcolony (Fig. 6) . This is an interesting phenotype, although with our present knowledge, hard to explain. Efficient Salmonella replication in epithelial cells is known to be dependent on tight microcolonies that are surrounded by intact Golgi membranes. Dispersed microcolonies were shown to result in decreased replication by others before [29] . However, in our case, cells that are depleted of STOM or ITGB4, show an increased Salmonella replication, despite of (or because of) dispersed microcolonies. This interesting phenotype is currently subject of further investigation. In our assay system, PRDX6 was enriched in the isolated Golgi-enriched fraction from Salmonella-infected cells, while ITGB4, ERBB2IP, STOM and TBC1D10B were depleted in these fractions. Despite the difference in the effect of infection on the abundance in the Golgi fraction of PRDX6 on the one hand, and that of the other four proteins on the other hand, depletion of each of the five proteins by siRNA led to increased Salmonella replication. Although at first sight this may look like a discrepancy, it should be kept in mind that the siRNA treatment leads to depletion of the respective proteins in the whole cell, whereas the changes in abundance upon infection in our assay system were observed in isolated Golgi fractions.
