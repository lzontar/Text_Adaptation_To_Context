Avoiding hypoxemia, hypercarbia and arterial hypotension are essential to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation and intracranial pressure (ICP) homeostasis. Presumably, the integrity of the respiratory system is a substantial element for optimal respiratory care in patients with moderate to severe TBI. In thoracic trauma, however, impaired alveolar gas exchange occurs frequently, resulting from lung contusions, pleural pathologies, disturbed ventilation mechanics or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Data are collected prospectively in consecutive time phases from the site of the accident until discharge from hospital. The documentation includes detailed information on demographics, injury pattern, comorbidities, pre-and in-hospital management, course on intensive care unit and outcome of each individual.

However, it is a novel finding that chest trauma in general, regardless of its initial severity (i.e. AIS Thorax \u2265 2), is associated with decreased chance of good neurologic recovery after TBI. Impaired neurologic recovery would be expected in case of serious or critical thoracic injuries, as these are frequently associated with severe hypoxemia or hypercarbia (i.e. pleural pathologies, lung contusions, ARDS) and circulatory shock -conditions which are known to have subsequent detrimental effects on TBI outcome (i.e. hypoxemia, increased ICP, poor cerebral perfusion) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, according to our results even minor forms of chest trauma (i.e. AIS = 2) are likely to decrease chance of good neurologic recovery, although one would expect that gas exchange and systemic perfusion would be less impaired by minor thoracic injuries. So far, evidence on the impact of chest trauma on functional outcome after TBI is mostly limited to small retrospective analyses. Results of a previous unmatched retrospective single center analysis of 505 TBI patients indicate that a Pulmonary Contusion Score \u2265 6, AIS Thorax \u2265 3, increasing age, increasing Thoracic Trauma Severity Score values, lower GCS, and abnormal pupillary function at hospital admission were associated with higher rates of unfavorable outcomes (i.e. GOS = 1-3) [3] . Given the unmatched nature of the study, especially with regard to initial GCS and low incidence of relevant chest trauma (AIS \u2265 3 = 8.1% of patients), the external validity of these findings and comparability to our study is limited.

To allow for adequate risk stratification of patients with TBI presenting with a relevant mechanism of injury, yet without clinical signs of thoracic injuries at hospital admission, a chest CT scan may be warranted to assess the presence Fig. 2 Impact of additional chest trauma (AIS Thorax = 2 / 3 / 4 / 5) on relative probability of good neurologic recovery (GOS = 5) after TBI. Each AIS Thorax -subgroup was compared to their respective matching partners with identical TBI severity and baseline characteristics, yet without additional thoracic trauma. Error bars indicate 95%-confidence intervals of the relative probability and severity of additional undetected thoracic injuries. This is of particular importance in elderly patients, who are at an increased risk for TBI. In the elderly, TBI is most commonly sustained from low energy mechanisms, such as falls [12, 13] . In this context, however, CT imaging of the chest may not necessarily be part of the workup of every patient with presumed isolated TBI. However, thoracic trauma is common in the elderly and minor injuries may be missed without CT, as they may present with normal clinical exam and chest x-ray findings [14, 15] . Without the recognition of the harmful effects of concomitant minor chest trauma, risk stratification and appropriate patient disposition is not possible. Furthermore, secondary hits on cerebral metabolism, such as hypoxemia, hypercarbia, significant anemia, poor cerebral perfusion must be avoided. In non-intubated patients, early use of non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen may provide suitable treatment options to improve pulmonary function and gas exchange. Adequate analgesia is of particular importance in thoracic trauma to improve respiratory mechanics and autonomous mobilisation of bronchial secretions. Early treatment (e.g. chest drain) of posttraumatic pleural pathologies may be helpful to decrease the risk for respiratory impairment. Furthermore, maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion (i.e. early vasopressor therapy and volume replacement) and normoglycemia are helpful to avoid secondary neurologic insults. This may be difficult in patients with hemorrhage from additional injuries, as blood pressure levels required for adequate cerebral perfusion may increase blood loss from uncontrolled bleeding sites. As even brief episodes of hypotension may have significant impact on TBI mortality and functional outcome, the risk and benefits of adequate cerebral perfusion must be carefully weighed [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1018, "end": 1022, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1026, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1336, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1340, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2676, "end": 2679, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 389, "end": 395, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "As any retrospective analysis of registry data, our study is subject to certain limitations. As we are restricted to the recorded items of the registry data set, not all information of interest (e.g. incidence/severity of hypoxemia or hypercarbia, cerebral perfusion and ICP values) is available. Although we are able to demonstrate that chest trauma is associated with worse outcome after TBI, we can merely speculate on causative mechanisms. In case of severe chest trauma (AIS Thorax = 4-5) , laboratory values at hospital admission and transfusion requirements may indicate higher rates of hemorrhage, coagulopathy and shock. This would certainly be expected to negatively influence TBI outcome. For less severe thoracic injuries (AIS Thorax = 2-3), however, we could not deduce a specific potential causative mechanism from the available data. Chest trauma is related to several determinants of TBI outcome, yet, based on the dataset of the TraumaRegister DGU\u00ae further differentiation of particular effects is not possible. Apart from compromising respiratory function, the presence of chest trauma inevitably increases overall injury severity and thereby contributes to posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response, which is known to exert negative effects on outcome after TBI [16] . However, as details on ventilation strategies, gas exchange or inflammatory markers are missing from the registry's dataset, the extent and interaction of these effects remain unclear. The evaluation of the neurological function of survivors by the GOS is limited to 4 major categories. As the spectrum of disability within the categories is relatively broad and the classification of patient status may be biased by subjective interpretation of treating physicians, a more objective and detailed assessment of neurologic function at hospital discharge would be desirable. Good neurologic recovery was defined as a GOS score of 5. Compared to other GOS scores (i.e. GOS 2-4), we considered a GOS of 5 to be a relatively unambiguous description of neurologic function.
