Thus, prevention, early detection, and intervention are key to minimizing the sequelae from HSCT-associated pulmonary complications. HSCT-associated pulmonary complications can be classified as infectious or noninfectious, and they often follow a predictable timeline, occurring during discrete phases of HSCT (preengraftment, early post-engraftment, late post-engraftment).

The most common causes of noninfectious pulmonary complications are related to the conditioning regimen used which can result in varying degrees of acute or delayed lung injury, the degree of recipient-donor HLA histoincompatibility, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source, the degree of graft manipulation, and the development of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), both acute and chronic.

These high-risk patients need to be screened weekly with PCR tests from the blood for adenovirus, CMV, and EBV and a serum galactomannan immunoassay for early Aspergillus detection. A comprehensive respiratory viral panel for a broad range of viruses is performed to all potential HSCT recipients during cold and flu season. Post-HSCT patients who present with rhinorrhea, cough, shortness of breath, fever, or a change in activity tolerance need immediate evaluation. A chest radiograph should be performed with new onset of fever and/or deterioration in respiratory status in patients during the peri-HSCT period. Chest computed tomography (CT) should be performed if the patient is persistently febrile. Pulmonary function tests should be done at regular intervals post-HSCT to detect deterioration of pulmonary function before a patient becomes symptomatic. Important prophylactic measures include frequent incentive spirometry, encouraging activity, and compliance with prophylactic antimicrobials, influenza vaccination, and avoidance of sick contacts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary"}, {"text": "\u2022 The risk of pulmonary complications post-HSCT continues to be high, and early recognition and treatment may improve outcome. \u2022 Post-HSCT-associated pulmonary complications can be classified as infectious or noninfectious. \u2022 The development of post-HSCT complications follows a relatively predictable timeline.

PJP is thought to infect most humans in early childhood and remains dormant. However, PJP may become active most often in immunocompromised HSCT patients greater than 30 days post-HSCT [1] [2] [3] .Risk factors: Risk factors for PJP include allogeneic HSCT recipients, poor T-cell function, post-HSCT corticosteroid use for the treatment of GvHD, a history of PJP prior to HSCT, and poor compliance with prophylaxis.Differential diagnosis: The differential diagnosis includes bacterial pneumonia (especially atypical bacterial pneumonia) Legionella pneumonia, other protozoa respiratory infections (e.g., Toxoplasma Gondii), and viral pneumonia.Clinical and radiographic features: Clinical features include a dry, nonproductive cough, acute onset of tachypnea and dyspnea, hypoxemia, fever, and malaise. Symptoms often rapidly progress; ABG reveals decreased PO 2 . CXR shows diffuse interstitial alveolar infiltrates that is bilateral and symmetric.Diagnostic studies: BAL with immunofluorescent staining for PJP is the gold standard for making the diagnosis of PJP. Often, serum LDH is elevated but is not diagnostic.Management and outcome: Management of PJP is three pronged: (1) support oxygenation (mechanical ventilation is often necessary), (2) administration of high-dose co-trimoxazole (see Chap. 28 for dosing guidelines), and (3) administration of corticosteroids to help dampen the associated pulmonary inflammation seen with PJP.
