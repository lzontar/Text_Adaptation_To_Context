Also, there are no missing values and the Excel file of the daily data are presented in Supplementary data. The data were analysed using the statistical software R. To visualize the data time series plots of the daily new confirmed cases data in Japan and South Korea for the 98-day period from January 20, 2020 to April 26, 2020, are displayed in Figure 1 and Figure2; respectively. It can be seen from Figure 1 and 2 that both original time series look much more nonstationary and present irregular pattern; therefore, the differencing transformation was incorporated as a useful approach to stabilize the original time series. In addition, the first-difference time series look stationary when compared with the original time series shown in Figure 1 and 2.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 515, "end": 523, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 571, "end": 579, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 912, "end": 920, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Data Description"}, {"text": "Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average model, referred as ARIMA model, is employed to analyse the daily new confirmed cases data in Japan and South Korea; respectively. Under the framework of Box-Jenkins method, model identification, estimation, diagnostic checking, and forecasting for ARIMA model was applied to the two original time series [3, 4] . The differencing transformation was used to achieve stationarity on certain nonstationary time series. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit-root test was also introduced to identify whether the time series is stationary [3] . In addition, the R package \"tseries\" and \"forecast\" were implemented to produce the numerical output for ARIMA [5] . The first difference of two original series and their ADF unit-root test appear to support stationary ARMA model; therefore, we consider a class of stationary ARMA model as appropriate. Combinating parsimonious parameter models, auto-selection of model order based on R package \"tseries\" and correlogram of the sample autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) shown in Figure 1 and 2 , we chose the orders for ARIMA model as ARIMA (6,1,7) in Japan and ARIMA (2,1,3) in South Korea; respectively. Furthermore, we adopted the following moment method and unconditional least squares to estimate the parameters for the stationary ARMA model. To save space, these estimated results were not reported. To check on the independence of the noise terms from the above ARMA model, we implemented the following diagnostic checking tools: a sequence plot of the residuals, the sample ACF of the residuals, and p-values for the Ljung-Box test statistic for a whole range of the residuals; which indicate the residuals from these ARIMA follow the white noise process. Therefore, the estimated ARIMA model can capture the dependent structure of the daily new confirmed cases time series very well. Finally, based on the above ARIMA model, the predicted value and the upper and lower limits of the predicted value under the 95% confidence level of the daily new confirmed cases for the 7-day period from April 27, 2020 to May 3, 2020 were reported in Table 1 and displayed in Figure  3 .
