To determine how to best reduce the effects of the pandemic and start reopening societies, governments have drawn insights from mathematical models of the spread of infectious diseases. We give an introduction to a family of mathematical models (called \"compartmental models\") and discuss how the results of analyzing these models influence government policies and human behavior, such as encouraging physical distancing to help slow the spread of the disease. Section 1: Modeling Infectious Diseases At the end of 2019, doctors and scientists learned about a new virus, now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that was spreading in China. The virus causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1,4,11] and has now spread throughout the world as a global pandemic. (See [12] to develop some intuition about pandemics and [1,8] for an accessible introduction to the COVID-19 pandemic.) What makes this virus so dangerous is how it spreads from person to person and the effects that it has on people who catch it.",

The most common procedure is to use what is called a compartmental model [3, 7] , an approach for studying disease spread that was invented almost 100 years ago and has been used successfully for forecasting in many epidemics. Compartmental models provide a way to formulate simple rules that approximate how a virus like SARS-CoV-2 spreads. The models can behave in complicated ways even when the rules are simple. When creating and studying such models, our goal is to improve the accuracy of forecasting disease spread and to provide a way to test the effects of possible responses (for example, if everyone stays at home) for reducing the spread. These results can inform people about helpful guidelines, policy, and actions [3] . In a compartmental model of an epidemic (see Figure 1 ), one separates a population into categories (called \"compartments\") and examines how people change categories. A frequently studied type of compartmental model is an SIR model , where SIR is short for susceptible-infected-recovered. The \"S\" compartment consists of people who are susceptible to infection (this means that they can get the disease), and the \"I\" compartment consists of people who are infected (and who can infect others). The \"R\" compartment is for people who have recovered from the infection, although \"R\" can also stand for \"removed\" to account for people who die from an infection.",

Before we can use the model to forecast the effects of a disease on a population, we have to know (or estimate) a few important factors: 1. The amount of time that a person is infectious. This tells us how long they can infect other people. 2. The rate of contact in a population. 3. The chance that a contact leads to an infection. In combination, these three factors allow one to estimate a quantity called the basic reproduction number . The basic reproduction number, denoted by R 0 (pronounced \"R naught\"), is the number of people, on average, to whom a single infected person spreads a disease if they are placed in a population of susceptible people. A quantity that is closely related to R 0 is the effective reproduction number, which is equal to R 0 multiplied by the fraction of a population who are susceptible. The effective reproduction number is important because some individuals in a population may be immune to a disease, as perhaps they were vaccinated or developed immunity from a past infection.",

On the third day, those 2 infected people can each infect 2 more susceptible people. In 3 days, that implies that we expect to have about 1 x 2 x 2 = 4 infected people. If this pattern continues and there are still many susceptible people, can you see how many new infections we get on the 4th day? We multiply by 2 again, so we expect to have about 8 newly infected people on the next day. After we do this calculation, we have to remind ourselves that these infections come from just 1 infected person.

The vertical axes in the plots indicate the number of people who are infected, and the horizontal axis indicates the number of days since the first person got the disease. The values on the vertical axis include all of the people in the susceptible, infected, or recovered classes on that day (not just the infections or recoveries that are new that day). In the top row (for which R 0 > 1), almost everybody eventually becomes infected in this simplistic scenario, so the number of susceptible people (the green curve) becomes very small. How quickly a disease takes hold in a population depends on the value of R 0 . When R 0 > 1, the number of people who are infected at the same time can be very large (the orange curve), and hospitals may not have the capacity to treat everybody who becomes infected. In the bottom row (for which R 0 < 1), the disease does not spread to many people in the population, so the curve of infected people (again in orange) over time is much flatter. This scenario is desirable, and if a disease is spreading quickly, we want to slow infections and \"flatten the curve\" (see Figure 3 ). We discuss \"flattening the curve\", along with behavior and policies that can help do this, in Section 3. Additionally, now that we have discussed R 0 some more, take another look at what happens when you change quantities like infection rates and recovery rates in the interactive simulation in [5] .

            "text": "Because of how easily people can become infected (and perhaps very sick) from COVID-19, many governments responded by closing schools, canceling sporting events and other large gatherings of people, quarantining infected people, and telling people to stay at home and practice \"physical distancing\" (often called \"social distancing\"). The goals of these kinds of policies and behaviors during a pandemic [8, 9, 12] is to try to limit both direct and indirect contacts and thereby \"flatten the curve\" of the number of infected people (see Figures 2 and 3 ). With measures like these, along with wearing masks and washing one's hands often, the orange curve of infected people in Figure  2 spreads out more over time and has a lower peak, indicating that the maximum number of infected people on any one day is smaller than it would otherwise be. This is important for hospitals to have enough capacity to treat as many people as possible, as indicated by the heights of the peak above the dashed horizontal lines in Figure 3 . With a flattened curve, although a disease continues to spread, there is more space in hospitals to treat infected people who need help; this reduces the number of deaths from a disease. Flattening the curve also decreases the total number of people who become infected over time (these are the colored regions of Figure 3 ). Mathematical models and computation have played a major role in influencing the responses of governments to the COVID-19 pandemic. These models -such as the one in [2], which influenced policy in Spain, and the one in [6] , which influenced policy in the United Kingdom -are much more detailed than the SIR model that we discussed above. For example, some models include compartments for hospitalization and for people without symptoms who can infect others. Other important data to include are contact-network structure (as we discussed above) and ages and other demographic factors (which may influence recovery and death rates).",

Now, she lives in sunny Los Angeles, where she is an assistant professor at Harvey Mudd College. In her work, Heather focuses on mathematical modeling of real-world applications, including the spreading of diseases and misinformation. Outside of work, Heather is spending her quarantine doing puzzles, listening to music, and making art. Once \"physical distancing\" is over, she's especially excited to go climbing and to share good food with family and friends.Unchitta Kanjanasaratool was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand before she moved to California in 2016. She just finished her undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics at UCLA. Unchitta gets excited by cool applications of mathematics, especially in the areas of modeling, network and data science, and the social sciences. She enjoys communicating mathematics and science and hopes to teach it in the future. Because she can't play ultimate frisbee (her favorite sport) during quarantine, she recently started woodworking as her new hobby.",

He focuses on modeling opinions spreading among individuals who share social connections. He is a first-generation college and graduate student. He is passionate about education and supporting the right to education. While in quarantine, he spends his time reading science fiction, cycling, and playing online board games with his friends. He is looking forward to going backpacking with friends when \"physical distancing\" orders are lifted.Mason A. Porte r is a professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA. He was born in Los Angeles, California, and he is excited to be a professor in his hometown. In addition to studying networks and other topics in mathematics and its applications, Mason is a big fan of games of all kinds, fantasy, baseball, the 1980s, and other delightful things. Mason used to be a professor at University of Oxford, where he did actually wear robes on occasion (like in the Harry Potter series). He is very eager to stop \"physical distancing\" (although he is determined to do it as long as necessary) and see his friends and students again in person, and he looks forward to spending quality time with them.",
