On the other hand, some studies identified a higher risk for diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus exhibits a close association with inflammation and increases the chance of developing COVID-19. Patients with diabetes mellitus have shown to have more virus entry, impaired immunity response, less viral elimination, and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. The parallel analysis of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) in chronic inflammation has been proved. Numerous immune cells express the DPP4 protein. DPP4 regulates antibody production, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin class switching. DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin reduce inflammation intensity in different states.",

S proteins bind to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell surface [1] .

Then, with an attachment of vesicle containing viral particles to the cell membrane [2] , the virus released and activated antigen-presenting cells (APC), which consequently stimulated humoral and cellular immunity systems as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and NFkappa-B signaling pathway, which regulated gene expression and altered immune cell differentiation [3] .

The PI3K pathway activated several serine/threonine kinases, like protein kinase B (PKB is also known as Akt) [13] . It largely contributed to insulin metabolic actions, including glucose hemostasis, lipid and protein synthesis, as well as an anti-inflammatory response. AKT proteins are the major investigated serine/threonine kinases involving in insulin resistance, which has realized that AKT2 activation is reduced in adipocytes and skeletal muscle in DM type two, leading to a higher inflammatory condition. MAPK pathway, another intracellular signal, is responsible for gene expression and affects the cell development and inflammatory cascades by intervening in the PI3K-AKT pathway. In certain conditions, MAPK can act as a serine protease of IRS and interfere with insulin signaling through an inappropriate activation [11] .",

The exact mechanism of insulin resistance is not yet determined, but the insidious role of inflammation underlying obesity, insulin resistance, and DM suggested by several studies [13] . Understanding the hypoglycemic effect of salicylate, an anti-inflammatory agent, via the inhibition of the Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (IKK), is the origin of such studies [13, 15] . Subsequent researches have further highlighted the positive relationship between inflammation and insulin resistance. They have also identified obesity as an essential factor in the development of insulin resistance and DM type two [13] . The downregulation of insulin receptors has seen in obesity leading to decrease insulin sensitivity [10] . IRS1 is a common mediator which attributed to insulin signaling dysregulation [12] . Reduced levels of IRS1 are also associated with insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia can reduce the IRS expression by negative transcription regulating [16] . Suppressors of cytokine signaling (Socs) are inflammatory proteins overwhelming IRS. Inflammation activates the Socs1 and Socs3, which induce ubiquitination, and finally disintegration of IRS proteins [12, 17] . Activation of the insulin receptor stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1, directing the signal transduction, while the two major inflammatory pathways inhibit signal propagation by serine kinase activity [12] . As previously mentioned, the NFkappa-B pathway plays a crucial role in an inflammatory response, silenced by NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) in resting cells and can fulminate by serine phosphorylation activity of IKK on I-kappa-B, results in I-kappa-B degradation, in inflammatory condition [13, 15] .",

DPP4 and caveolin-1 interaction lead to CARMA1-lipid rafts. CARMA1 belongs to the MAGUK family (caspase recruitment domain 11-containing membrane-associated kinase) whose role is the regulation of NF-kappa-B activation in lymphocytes [20] . The dimerization of CD26 is essential for its binding to CARMA1. The interaction of CARMA1-dimeric CD26 is via the cytoplasmic tail of the second one. This binding of APC to CD26 causes caveolin-1 phosphorylation and interleukin-1 receptor-associated serine/threonine kinase 1 (IRAK-1) and Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) dissociation from caveolin-1 [22] . Both IRAK-1 and Tollip are involved in the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway [20] . Afterward, the phosphorylation of IRAK-1 is occurred, and activates NF-kappa-B [22] . This activation may cause TNF-alpha secretion and, consequently, JNK activation. Parallel, NF-kappa-B activation induces M1 macrophage and then, different interleukins secretion, including IL1, IL6, and IL12 (FIG. 1) [22] . Likewise, the secretion of TNF-alpha caused by NFkappa-B during the inflammation activates DPP4, which causes the migration and maturation of CD4 + T-cell, especially TH1, TH17, and cytokine secretion. DPP4 probably also has a role in the induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) alpha [22] , which exaggerates the inflammation (FIG. 1) .",

M2 phenotype can produce anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10 and IL13, but the M1 form produces inflammatory cytokines like IL1, IL1beta, IL 6, IL12, TNF-alpha, and IL8 and involve in different inflammatory conditions [32] . IL6 is a proinflammatory cytokine that triggers the NF-kappa-B pathway and allows it to translocate, transcript, and finally, release inflammatory mediators [20] . The NF-kappa-B pathway is an essential transcription factor for the induction of the M1 phenotype of macrophage and essential for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes that encode IL1beta, IL6, TNFalpha, cyclooxygenase two, and IL12 [33] . NF-kappa-B induces differentiation of inflammatory T cells to consist of Th1 and Th17 that mediate inflammatory response and involved in different autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions. Th1 secretes interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which contributes to inflammatory processes. NFkappa-B promotes secretion of cytokines by affecting the TCR signaling, which increases the differentiation of Th1 cells [34] . Th17 secrete IL17, which recruits neutrophils and monocytes to the site of inflammation. The aberrant activation of the NF-kappa-B pathway stimulates TLR to produce IL6, which induce Th17 differentiation and increase the production of IFN-gamma and IL1beta with T cells [31, 34] . As mentioned above, TLRs are the members of the PRPs group that involved in the activation of inflammatory processes. TLRs signaling activates the intracellular signaling processes and leads to the NF-kappa-B translocation to the nucleus [35] . Patients with COVID-19 have multi-organ damages like liver, heart and kidney disorders, and acute respiratory distress syndrome Monocyte chemo attract protein-1 (MCP1) compared to non-ICU patients [27] . It has been clear that sever cases of COVID-19 patients with higher neutrophil/lymphocyte had a higher level of inflammatory cytokines like IL6, IL1, but a lower account of CD4+T cells level compared to COVID-19 patients with a lower ratio of neutrophil/lymphocyte [36] . In the peripheral blood of COVID-19-patients, the number of lymphocytes decreased, but they are in the excessive activated status. In this condition, activated CD8 + T cells have a higher expression level of CD44, CD69, and CD38, but activated CD4 + T cells have a higher level than healthy control individuals [3, 37] .",

Elevated NF-kappa-B pathway expression in diabetes affects the immune system in such patients. Diabetic patients could also suffer from high levels of Th1 and Th17, which can explode the inflammatory cascade in an uncontrolled manner [3] . Activation of the innate immune system in adipose tissue has been suggested in connection with inflammation, obesity, and diabetes [38] . Weight gain causes adipose tissue remodeling and expansion with inadequate supporting of vasculature leading to higher oxygen supply and, consequently, trigger cellular Hif-1 to promote inflammation state [12] . As a part of inflammation state, adipokines may alter, where MCP1, MIP, IL8, IL6, IL1beta, and TNF-alpha are increased, as well as, adiponectin and IL10 are less secreted [38, 39] . These higher factors will activate adipose tissue macrophages and T cells, leading to the release of more pro-inflammatory chemokine to attract other immune cells [40, 41] . Various evidence has indicated that adipose tissue macrophages play a major role and confront inflammation in the metabolic organs. It is also determined that predominantly anti-inflammatory M2-type macrophages are transformed into proinflammatory M1-macrophages in the obese population [13, 42] . IKK plays a vital role in both obesity and metabolic disorders and is also involved in interferon signaling, which is essential for fighting with viral infections [15] . Enhanced production of IFN-gamma in adipose and hepatic tissue may also cause insulin resistance contributing to the switch from M2 macrophages to the M1 phenotype [42] . Free fatty acids are also able to promote NF-kappa-B by TLR2/4 activation leading M1-subset to overcome [12, 15] . One of the most co-existing complications of diabetes is obesity-induced insulin resistance. It has a major role in ongoing inflammation, via the macrophage switching to M1 type, the release of various cytokine; especially, IL6 and TNF-alpha, increase Th1 and Th17 cells, stimulation of TLR2/4 and finally activation of IKK (FIG. 1) . Macrophages can also exert their inflammatory responses via Jnk-1 signaling, an important component of obesityinduced insulin resistance [12] . Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL6, disturb the insulin action, which consequently leads to systemic and local insulin resistance [43] . TNF-alpha impairs insulin function by IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation blockade in adipose and muscle tissue [44] .",

Epidemiological documentations have declared severe clinical manifestation and more complications in patients with COVID-19 and co-morbid diabetes [25] . The chronic state of low-grade inflammation and increased formation of glycosylated end products and oxidative reactive stress may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of individuals with diabetes. One of the suggesting sites of intervention between diabetes and COVID-19 is IKK with a particular relative role on NF-kappa-B signaling, as well as simultaneously association with insulin resistance and viral infection combat. Chronic expression of IKK in diabetes shows the double burden of diabetes and viral infections [15] . Although there is a basal inflammatory activity among the diabetic hosts, the strong clinical evidence has supported delayed and dysregulated inflammatory signals followed by impaired immune responses. Aligned with inflammation, ACE2 expression, and Furin level, the two important binding mediators who mediate the virus entry and initiate viral pathogenesis, have been augmented in diabetic hosts [46, 47] . The altered glucose metabolism and oxidative stress have directly impaired phagocytic activity of neutrophils and macrophages [48] . Together with defective APC recruitment and function, the initiation of adaptive immunity delayed in diabetic populations. A unique cytokine profile in the diabetic state also modifies the acquired immunity through both arms. In T-cell subset, CD4+ Th1, Th17, and CD8 + cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are up-regulated, whereas CD4+ Th2 and regulatory T (Treg) cells are diminished [48, 49] . Treg cells have an important role in immunological tolerance. The CD4 involved in the auto-reactive T cells suppression and in vivo studies showed that they prevented the progression of diabetes [50] . Diabetes also delays the B-cells activation, which may have considerable regulatory effects on the other functional immune response [48] .",

COVID-19 patients who reached the late sever stages developed the remarkable lymphocytopenia, and inflammatory cytokine storm, which caused multi-organ damage. Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection shows an immune system dysregulation with the major role of a well-known inflammatory pathway, NFkappa-B. The NF-kappa-B involves the defective cycle, which induces inappropriate CD4+T cell differentiation, and more inflammatory signals, that causes the systemic inflammatory condition and various organs to be involved with pro-inflammatory cytokines and consecutively lead to cytokine storm. On the other hand, diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder closely associated with obesity and insulin resistance. It has been revealed that the inflammatory process has an ambiguous role in diabetes onset and development. It is Considering the fact that diabetic patients are more likely to contract COVID-19 infection. Signaling analysis of diabetes-inflammation linkage indicates the persistent NF-kappa-B activity and low grade chronic inflammatory state among the diabetic population.",

Due to the different role of DPP4 in the immune system, such as inflammation-related disease, immune responses, and T cell activation, especially Th1 and Th17, which have an inflammatory effect, DPP4 inhibitors are considered useful. As discussed, this drug class can meet all of the above antiinflammatory goals owning to their effects on the immune system. The drug inhibitory effect on various interleukins and cytokines such as IL6, IL1beta, and TNF-alpha, has been approved in different in vitro/in vivo studies. The recent evidence of SARS-CoV-2 docking analysis, which has interestingly shown the interaction of S glycoprotein and DPP4 receptors, magnifies the DPP4 inhibitors' role more than before. Sitagliptin decreases the inflammation via suppressing main inducers and different characters in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway. Hence, DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin should be a good candidate for controlling the inflammation.",

Diabetes mellitus exhibits a close association with inflammation and increases the chance of developing COVID-19. Patients with diabetes mellitus have shown to have more virus entry, impaired immunity response, less viral elimination, and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. The parallel analysis of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) in chronic inflammation has been proved. Numerous immune cells express the DPP4 protein. DPP4 regulates antibody production, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin class switching. DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin reduce inflammation intensity in different states. Following the accumulating data, we hypothesize that sitagliptin might reduce COVID-19 severity. Sitagliptin, an available DPP4 inhibitor drug, showed multidimensional antiinflammatory effects among diabetic patients. It reduces the inflammation mostly by affecting on NF-kappa-B signaling pathway.
