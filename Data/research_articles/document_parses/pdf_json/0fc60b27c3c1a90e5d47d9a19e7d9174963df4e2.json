Leucopenia and lymphopenia were the most common signs of infection while liver and kidney damage were rare but may cause bad outcomes for patients.

Similarly, in the United States, more than half of patients aged between 20-64 years (65%), and patients under 19 only accounted for 5% of all patients. Older aged patients were more prone to getting infected compared to the young [1] . The US's data also indicated that patients younger than 19 had milder COVID-19 illness, with almost no hospitalizations or deaths reported [W4]. Based on a worldwide data, the elderly (aged over 60) were at a high risk of developing into severe disease or death [W3-W5, 2]. About the gender ratio, the male to female ratio of con rmed cases was 1.06:1.00 in China [3] .

The rst stage: people with exposure histories to Huanan Seafood Market (HSM) got infected [5] . Forty-one patients were found to be having SARS-like symptoms in December 2019, and the HSM was believed to be one of the origins of the virus. However, 13 of the 41 patients reported no prior exposure to the HSM thus indicating that the origin of the virus needed further investigation [6] . The second temporal stage is the transition from community transmissions to the outbreak in Wuhan [5] . The virus was mainly spread to multiple communities directly and indirectly by people with HSM exposure histories. The interpersonal transmissions and clustered transmissions formed community transmissions [5] . An early study showed that the proportion of patients with HSM exposure histories decreased from 55-8.6% within 22 days, indicating people who did not have exposure histories to the HSM became infected [7, 8] . The third stage: the epidemic in China. At this stage, transmissions began to expand to communities outside Wuhan and the Hubei province as a whole [5] . On 26th Jan 2020, a study involving 62 COVID-19 patients outside Wuhan found that all the patients had been exposed to Wuhan, which demonstrated an established local transmission outside Wuhan [9] . The fourth temporal stage is the global pandemic. On 13th Jan 2020, the rst case outside China was reported in Thailand [W1]. On 30th Jan 2020, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [W1] . It subsequently took about 51 days for transmission to escalate from the rst reported case to the 10,000th reported case outside China. Globally, it took 16 days for the number of reported cases to increase from 10,000th cases to 100,000th cases, 21 days from 100,000th cases to 500,000th cases, only 6 days from 500,000th cases to 1,000,000th cases and 13 days from 1,000,000th cases to 2,000,000th cases [W1].",

Other reasons accounting for these high infection rates among medical personnel varied according to different country's circumstances. An Italy study pointed out hospitals as a potential hotspot for infection. Facilities and medical personnel turned into untested vectors and patients [W13, W14]. In the US for example, the reasons that turned hospitals into infection hotspots included the overload of COVID-19 patients and inappropriate management against the pandemic in hospitals [W15] . Similar to the US, 200 medical workers got infected in a county hospital in Romania due to inadequate hospital management. In Egypt, a serious wave of emigration by physicians for years led to patient overload for remaining medical workers and placed them at higher risk of infection through continuous exposure. The emigration wave was purportedly caused by low salary, undesirable working conditions, lack of legal protection, and shortage . Further studies are however required to identify and assess other potential transmission patterns for further prevention, especially since some cases were asymptomatic [15, 16] . In addition, patients who were considered cured and no longer needed quarantine still tested RT-PCR positive after 5 to 13 days [17] .",

Besides, although only 7% of patients showed renal biomarker abnormalities, renal damage might contribute to the nal multi-organ failure and death outcome [33, 34].",

The clinical course could be divided into four stages based on CT scan ndings [37] . In the rst stage (Pre-symptom), GGO, unilateral and multifocal were observed among most patients in this stage [37, 38] . In the second stage (symptoms \u2264 1 week), lesions soon developed into bilateral and diffused except for GGO. This stage was considered a period from transition to consolidation. A mixed pattern of transition and consolidation develops during this stage. In the third stage (symptoms 1-2 weeks), the GGO was still common and the consolidation pattern showed. Findings indicated an interstitial change, which was considered as the development of brosis. In the fourth stage (symptom 2-3 weeks), consolidation and mixed patterns were more common, and the GGO started to shrink [37] , the consolidation was gradually absorbed among patients who recovered at last [39] .",

The common symptoms had a little difference in Europe and Asia. Body temperatures above 39.0 \u2103, dyspnea, and anorexia were more common symptoms in severe patients. Age over 60 years old, having co-morbidities, and developing complications were high-risk factors developed into severe conditions or death. A decrease in leukocytes was common, the abnormal lab biomarkers of cardiac, liver, and renal were found. Observed from the CT ndings, GGO and the bilateral lung involvement were common, the longer the time after symptoms onset, the more consolidated lung lesions were found. ",

For instance, among 1836 reported cases in Guangdong and Sichuan Provinces, most cluster infections occurred in families (78%-85%) [W3]. The WHO in this regard issued a statement that household transmission highly occurred among medical workers' families than health facility infection in China. Household transmission was also a signi cant pattern observed in South Korea and the US [W1, W15]. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) had provided guidance for the control of household transmission in European countries [W3, W17]. What made household transmission worse was that some groups (age < 18 and > 65) had high risk got infection within households than the general population [W18]. So, children and elderly living with medical workers at a higher risk of getting than other populations. Fourthly, transmissions in a closed environment besides the home should also be of a keen focus on the prevention and control of this outbreak. A Japanese health department reported that a closed environment could promote super-spreading events because the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in a closed environment was the same as large-scale transmission, such as the ski chalet-cluster infection in France and the church-hospital infection clusters in South Korea [W19]. For example, outbreaks of the COVID-19 were observed in multiple prisons in China, the UK, and the US [W20, W21, 3]. Cluster infections also happened on cruise ships, such as the Diamond Princess, Grand Princess, Golden Princess, Ruby Princess, Phoenix Reisen, MS Westerdam, and Punta Arenas [W22]",

The study mentioned that 'super-spreader' might cause unexpected transmission during the pilgrimage[47], when huge number of people gathering with a high population density. Reasons causing the super-spreading event might include: immune suppression, increased disease severity and viral load, asymptomatic individuals, and extensive social interactions[48]. However, the characteristics and features of how an individual became a super-spreader were not clear[W40]. Summarizing the features of the 'super spreader' concept, as well as their characteristics and role in transmissions, are needed in future disease control[49]. Fourth, it has been reported that some cured patients COVID-19 retested positive by PCR after being discharged and quarantined at home in multiple places[W41, 17]. The reason for this phenomenon is still unclear and hence further investigations are required for future pandemic control [W42].There existed some limitations in this review. Firstly, this review base on the English and Chinese resource. As the COVID-19 transform to global pandemic from regional outbreak, comprehensive collection of the related information worldwide is needed. Secondly, the clinical spectrum based on general population, while subgroup analyzes may help to gure more entire picture of the COVID-19. For instance, Kawasaki disease were found in children in the UK and Europe countries [W43]. However, other places did not report the gathering Kawasaki disease cases as the UK and Europe.",
