For example, for confirmed stay-at-home COVID-19 patients, a longitudinal audio test could be developed to determine contact-with-hospital recommendations, and for the most critical COVID-19 patients a success ratio forecast test, including patient clinical data, to prioritize ICU allocation. As a challenge to the engineering community and in the context of our clinical trial, the authors suggest distributing cough recordings daily, hoping other trials and crowdsourcing users will contribute more data. Previous approaches to complex AI tasks have either used a static dataset or were private efforts led by large corporations. All existing COVID-19 trials published also follow this paradigm. Instead, we suggest a novel open collective approach to large-scale real-time health care AI. We will be posting updates at https://opensigma.mit.edu. Our personal view is that our approach is the right one for large scale pandemics, and therefore is here to stay -will you join?",

In the past, speech recognition algorithms have been demonstrated to be able to perform various tasks related to cough detection. 3 In several cases involving different neurological conditions, researchers were able to develop machine learning algorithms that used free-flow speech to predict disease onset earlier than human experts, including psychosis with a sample size of less than 50, 4 and cognitive impairment with less than a thousand 5 . These studies effectively demonstrate the potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve superhuman diagnosis capabilities, which we now believe can also be leveraged for COVID-19 diagnosis. Previous research shows audio recordings can be used to diagnose pneumonia 6 , even from cheap cell phone recordings, 7 similar to the COVID-19 example shown in Figure 1 . Dysphonia can be caused by and lead to the detection of inflammatory conditions such as allergies 8 , infections 9 , reflux 10 , smoking 11 Details of our implementation will be published elsewhere. After trying a few models, we modified a biologically inspired SOP, trained on regular speech. To do so, we started with a convolutional neural network trained on a regular speech dataset and then applied transfer learning. Transfer learning is a field of machine learning that focuses on improving the predictive power of an algorithm on a specific task by learning from a similar but distinct task. In formal terms, we can define a domain that is composed by a feature space and marginal distribution ( ). A task for a given domain is defined as a label space and predictive function , which is based on a conditional distribution ( | ). We can therefore define a source domain",

These features are then processed using a shallow classifier (e.g. logistic regression, SVM, k-Nearest-Neighbors). This approach is especially utilized when the target domain \" has very few labeled examples, which is the case within our application, but tends to be surpassed by \"fine-tuning\" approaches when more data is available 30 , by retraining specific layers from data within the target domain. We also tested this approach by pre-training DenseNet201 31 and ResNet50 32 architectures with samples from the speech dataset. We then used the output of the last layer of each of the models to generate features from our small set of cough recordings from COVID19 diagnosed and healthy patients (0.7 train, 0.3 test split).",

It is difficult to say at the current time how important such metadata may be. In some cases, metadata not used by humans can yield superhuman results in AI algorithms. For example, unlike human specialists, AI can detect gender information from retina scans. 35 Until we have a sizable and longitudinal sample database, we cannot be sure how many useful tests a COVID-19 detection algorithm can extract from sound signals. Indeed, it would be irresponsible to set upper or lower limits at this point. The data may be heavily biased towards one particular language, or the model may only apply to the onset of the disease -where the clinical trial is focusing on.

Healthy and COVID-19 diagnosed tussication samples were run through the spoken digit model, 1024 features were extracted from the last convolutional layer and, for the purposes of the right plot, subsequently dimensionally reduced using Principal Component Analysis.
