Here, using an ISG 26 screen against VSV-SARS-CoV and VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric viruses, we identified 27 CH25H and its enzymatic product 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) as potent inhibitors of 28 virus replication. Mechanistically, internalized 25HC accumulates in the late endosomes 29 and blocks cholesterol export, thereby restricting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein catalyzed 30 membrane fusion. Our results highlight a unique antiviral mechanism of 25HC and 31 provide the molecular basis for its possible therapeutic development. 32 33",

Unlike IFITM3, CH25H partially retained its antiviral 115 activity and led to reduced VSV-SARS-CoV-2 replication in TMPRSS2-expressing cells 116 (Fig. 3A) . Similarly, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 replication was inhibited by CH25H and 25HC 117 in TMPRSS2 expressing cells (Fig. 3B) . 118 119 We next examined the effect of 25HC on SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S mediated 120 membrane fusion, since 25HC blocks cell fusion by Nipah F and VSV G proteins 28 , which 121 are class I and class III viral fusion proteins respectively 34 . We set up an in vitro cell-to-122 cell fusion assay based on the expression of S, GFP, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 in HEK293 123 cells, independently of virus infection (Fig. 3C) . CH25H expression substantially reduced 124 syncytia formation mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. 3C) . Although IFITM2 and IFITM3 125 inhibited VSV-SARS-CoV-2 replication ( Fig. 1A-B) , neither prevented S-mediated fusion 126 ( Fig. 3C) , suggesting a distinct mode of antiviral action. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 S, 127 SARS-CoV S induced weaker cell fusion as recently reported 35 , and this process was 128 also blocked by CH25H expression (Fig. 3C) . CH25H also inhibited the syncytia formation 129 induced by Western equine encephalitis virus glycoproteins (class II) and VSV-G (class 130 III) but not reovirus FAST p10 (class IV) fusion protein 36 (Fig. 3D) . To mimic the virus-cell 131 membrane fusion, we co-transfected SARS-CoV-2 S and GFP into donor cells and mixed 132 at 1:1 ratio with ACE2+TMPRSS2+TdTomato co-transfected target cells. As expected, 133 we observed robust syncytia formation under mock conditions (Fig. S3B) . CH25H 134 expression in 'recipient' cells almost completely abolished cell-cell fusion (Fig. S3B) . 135",
