We aimed to quantify severity of COVID-19 infection on High-Resolution CT and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. Materials and Methods: From Jan 11, 2020, to Feb 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory and HRCT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. Results: Thirty-five (83%) patients exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips and air bronchograms, compared to initial CT (all p<0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R=0.68, p<0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R range 0.36-0.75, p<0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (p=0.001-0.04). Conclusions: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground-grass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements. Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.

Some investigations (16, 20), including the current one (14), 228 have shown some frequently encountered HRCT findings, some of which were similar 229 with other viral pneumonias, including specifically SARS, MERS and H7N9 pneumonia 230 (21-23). In terms of distribution, the lower lobes are preferentially affected, especially the 231 left lower lobe in our study group (34/42 cases in the initial onset stages). Pulmonary 232 lesions were most commonly in the subpleural, peribronchovascular area, or distributed 233 diffusively. In the early stages, single or multiple small ground-glass infiltration, 234 consolidation and interstitial thickening could be seen. As the disease progressed, severe 235 cases had more consolidation and air bronchograms in the relevant lobes.

Because of the 245 individualized treatments and individual heterogeneity, the same correlation was not 246 significant after admission to the hospital. However, the total opacification severity score 247 was still increasing with a relatively slower speed than that before treatments. 248 According to the follow-up CT images, in the early stage from illness onset, most 249 patients (83%) exhibited progression and more advanced involvement of the 250 opacifications, although all patients were hospitalized for regular treatments, including 251 oxygen inhalation, antiviral therapy, and corticosteroids and immunoglobulin therapy 252 when necessary. This may be related to the immunopathological basis that the 253 coronaviruses interact with and modify the host intracellular environment during 254 infection for the benefit of quickly replicating. The majority of studies have suggested 255 that a dysregulated/exuberant innate response is the leading contributor to coronavirus-256 mediated pathology (24).

Besides, we only included 290 hospitalized patients with follow-up CT exams to ensure more information on clinical and 291 CT characteristics. Possible selection bias should be noted and further study of a larger 292 cohort is required to obtain a definitive answer. Collection of a larger cohort would help 293 to better define the clinical presentation and imaging features. Second, the quantitative 294 and semi-quantitative methods for measuring the pulmonary lesions may have certain 295 subjectivity. Third, the susceptibility of COVID-19 was considered (initially and 296 incorrectly) to be very low among infants, children and adolescents, so we didn't 297 retrospectively study these groups.

The disease is spreading at a 36 striking speed. Since in our institution the first case was discovered in late Dec, 2019, 37 until 12 th , February, the confirmed cases in China has exceeded 45,000 in such a short 38 period. Of these, approximately 34,000 were from Hubei province (4). More and more 39 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia have also been reported worldwide. The emerging and 40 urgent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised intense attention globally (5). 41 The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which includes viruses that 42 cause diseases ranging from the common influenza to Severe Acute Respiratory 43 Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (1). According to the 44 epidemiological investigation, these viruses are highly infectious and can spread rapidly 45 in humans (6). The main route of transmission is via respiratory droplets, as well as 46 physical contact. Current estimates are that the incubation period is generally 3-7 days, and up to 14 days (7). People are generally susceptible. The elderly and those with 48 underlying diseases are more seriously ill after infection (8). Children and infants can also 49 be infected. The SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to SARS-CoV and may cause severe 50 illness similar clinically to SARS (9). Early disease progression can be rapid, and 51 sometimes results in severe respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit admission 52 (26%-32%) and death (4.3%-15%) (2, 8, 10). 53 The Chinese health authorities did immediate investigations and implemented 54 4 important measures to characterize this novel pneumonia and restrict its prevalence. 55 Many cities in Hubei province were sealed off from all outside contact to stop the spread 56 of the plague. Meanwhile, efficient diagnosis and treatment procedures were developed 57 (11). Symptoms resulting from COVID-19 infection in the prodromal phase include fever, 58 dry cough, and malaise, which are nonspecific (2, 8, 10). Some patients may not even 59 have obvious symptoms. Therefore, chest computed tomography (CT) , in particular high-60 resolution computed tomography (HRCT) represent valuable tools identifying patients 61 with COVID-19 infections in an early stage when clinical symptoms may be unspecific 62 or sparse (12-14). For every suspected patient, chest CT is indispensable for definitive 63 diagnosis and reexamination. According to World Health Organization and Centers for 64 Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, chest radiography and CT were the major 65 diagnostic components when SARS was prevalent (15). 66 The clinical and imaging manifestations in the early stage of COVID-19 are 67 particularly important. They can be used to confirm the diagnosis, judge the changes in 68 severity, adjust the treatment plan and infer the prognosis. The purpose of our study was 69 to characterize the clinical and HRCT features in patients with COVID-19 infection 70 retrospectively, to facilitate early identification and early isolation.

In a previous study of convalescent patients after SARS, thin-section CT scores for GGO or interstitial opacities were found to be correlated with neutrophil count, CRP and LDH level (28).Guan et al. (29)  detected that severe cases of COVID-19 prominently had elevated levels of CRP (\u226510 mg/L) (81.5% vs 56.4%, p<0.001) and LDH (\u2265250U/L) (58.1% vs 37.2%, p<0.001) as compared with non-severe cases.A multicenter study of clinical characteristics in 1099 patients with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 highlighted that the surveillance case definition should not heavily focus on fever detection, considering only 43.8% of patients had fever on initial any abnormalities on initial CT, but were positively associated with progression of the opacification on follow-up CT (mean 7 days after initial CT). These findings indicate that high fever on initial presentation is a potential risk factor of adverse CT outcomes over a short-term follow-up, however the limited cases in this study should be noted. Moreover, several initial CT findings, including sum score and max score for opacification severity as well as area of the max lesion in cross-section, were inversely associated with \u0394 Sum.A possible explanation for these results may be that patients with relatively serious pulmonary opacities on initial CT have already progressed and then there was a short plateau stage or a gradual decrease trend in abnormalities (14, 30).This study has some limitations. First, this is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to the hospital. At the time of data collection, nucleic acid tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 had not yet been available for all the suspected patients and the detection rate of RT-PCR nucleic acid tests was not high (12, 13). Besides, we only included hospitalized patients with follow-up CT exams to ensure more information on clinical and CT characteristics. Possible selection bias should be noted and further study of a larger cohort is required to obtain a definitive answer. Second, the quantitative and semiquantitative methods for measuring the pulmonary lesions may have certain subjectivity.Third, the susceptibility of COVID-19 was considered (initially and incorrectly) to be very low among infants, children and adolescents, so we didn't retrospectively study these groups. More effort should be made to identify the clinical and imaging features in these groups in future studies.In conclusion, the results of this study confirmed that chest CT is important in thediagnosis and management of the COVID-19 infection. Despite meticulous treatments, most patients demonstrated progressions in the early stage from illness onset, according to the follow-up CT examinations. Our clinical and radiologic study findings show that CRP, ESR and LDH level positively correlate with the severity of lung abnormalities quantified on initial CT; moreover, high fever is associated with an adverse follow-up CT outcome, which may add a further facet in the understanding of the clinical expression of this new outbreak. Being familiarized with the clinical and CT features and the early changes of the COVID-19 infection, is of paramount importance.
