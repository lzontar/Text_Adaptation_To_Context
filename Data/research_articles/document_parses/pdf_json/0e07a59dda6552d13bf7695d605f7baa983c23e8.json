A significant cohort of patients from this outbreak developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia. H1N1 has since been transmitted across the world. Little has been described on the renal complications of this illness. Methods A retrospective review of all patients admitted to our institution with H1N1 infection was carried out from July to November 2009. Renal biochemistry, need for renal replacement therapy and hospital outcome was recorded. Results Thirty-four patients with H1N1 were admitted. Average length of admission was 10 days (3-84). Eleven patients (32%) developed acute kidney injury (AKI) as defined by the RIFLE criteria (creatinine range 120-610). Four patients required renal replacement therapy, for a range of 10-52 days. Seven patients developed AKI that responded to volume resuscitation. The commonest cause of AKI was sepsis with acute tubular necrosis.
