Our goal is to provide decision makers with a reliable model, which can guide locational decisions to address current disease occurrence and mitigate its future occurrence and severity. To this end, the applied model rests on a quantitative definition of neighbourhood relationships in the city of Calgary. Our proposition is that such relationships, usually described by Euclidean distance, can be more effectively described by alternative distance metrics.

Many of the most urgent health concerns of today's society are fundamentally spatial in nature: effective accessibility to health care services; prompt and efficient response to epidemic outbreaks; detection and monitoring of environmental health hazards and consequent urban planning. Spatial analytical methods can be useful management and policy tools to address these concerns, but their use rests on assumptions that are often violated by empirical process, so that much current applied research fails to bring this toolset to its full potential. Presently, management decisions are often supported by quantitative models, specifically regression models, which are potentially desirable tools that can link, for example, disease incidence to residents' age, thus providing a realistic picture of where health care services will be most needed in the near future. Unfortunately, current models are often uncertain or unreliable. In the best cases, unreliable models provide decision makers with a realistic, but blurry picture of the factors they need to manage, potentially leading to ineffective decisions; in the worst cases the picture is so blurry that it may lead to management decisions that are not just ineffective, but harmful. The uncertainty stems from two properties of geographical phenomena: spatial nonstationarity (things vary unevenly in space), and spatial dependence (near things are more similar than distant things) [1] . Addressing the limitations of regression models is the key to improve the reliability of much current quantitative analysis, if, as noted by Griffith and Amrhein [2] , most of the multivariate techniques commonly used by geographers can be formulated or reformulated in terms of regression analysis. This paper presents an application of spatial regression analysis, aimed at reducing the uncertainty of the model by optimizing the specification of the spatial weight matrix. The core of our work is the evaluation of the performance of alternative distance metrics in capturing the spatial dependence of heart disease incidence and its related socio-economic factors.

The model, however, remains in part unsatisfactory for statistical as well as conceptual reasons. From the statistical standpoint, the relatively low value of the rho parameter suggests that the autoregressive component of the model fails to capture most of the spatial dependence in the data. Considering the high cross-correlation between the dependent and some of the independent variables 8 , we suspect that high spatial cross-correlations also exist among these variables, and the effect of these correlations is reflected in the rho value. We have not tested for spatial cross-correlations, as we were not prepared to address them in a comprehensive spatial model, but we believe that this is an important line of future enquiry.

A model that includes such variables would better assist in the definition of more effective social policies, the provision of appropriate health services, and most importantly would help identify localized pockets of risk beyond the known demographic factors. Using standard model selection procedures, the demographic variables remain the only significant variables in any multivariate specification. Therefore, in order to force other variables into the model, we deliberately omitted the demographic ones, obtaining a model that necessarily has a lower goodness-of-fit, but bears perhaps a greater value from a planning and policy making point of view.

The negative and highly significant coefficient of families with children suggests a negative correlation between disease and individuals in young families and appears to be related to fairly young individuals, at early to mid stages of their career, likely with relatively high education and moderately high income, likely residing in the suburbs. 8 The positive relationship between disease incidence and low education (less than grade 13) may relate to represents old age and fringes of poverty and low social status. The negative coefficient linking disease incidence and individual with postsecondary, but non university education identifies trade workers and professionals: a category with fairly high income levels, possibly lower than those of individuals with university degrees. We would like to note that the variable \"individuals with university degrees\" correlates highly (and negatively) with \"individuals with grade 13 or lower education\" and therefore cannot be entered in the same regression; however, alternative model specifications present a significant and negative coefficient of \"university degree\".
