This free movement shall now be reinforced through the full application of the new general system for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, in which veterinary medicine is included. The success of this measure for internal market development imposes availability of professionals with the highest possible basic training and opportunities for continuing education and specialisation. Such benchmark definition requires the establishment of veterinary training throughout the EU to focus on the qualitative aspects of the basic training they impart. New production forms, new labour markets and a higher degree of consciousness of the producers and the consumers, together with an ever-increasing load of new information and knowledge in most veterinary fields had forced changes in veterinary education strategies. These changes have led to the adaptation of curricula and the application of new pedagogical concepts ultimately leading to the design of new, exciting programmes of veterinary training. Some of them use a combination of basic education and elective terms while others have focused training in species-oriented tracks already by the time students enter the clinical level. There is general consent that the quality of basal training must enable the student to achieve a level of confidence in life-long learning so he/she would be able to follow relevant CPD's and, eventually, pursue specialisation. At the same time, veterinary establishments are concerned with their ability to achieve these goals, mostly due to the usual high costs of veterinary training that constrain their chances to maintain equality of training levels through the EU. We need to find tools to harmonise veterinary training among the establishments of veterinary education in Europe, beyond the compulsory subject and training minimum requirements laid down by the Directive 78/1027. Harmonisation requires regulations but also awareness. Establishments of veterinary education must not only comply with regulations but also become aware of the advantages of quality assurance of their basic training.

Other important actors were also included such as employers of veterinarians, consumers of veterinary services, professional associations, etc. The results, although emanating from an overall rather small sample which might be considered by some countries/regions as insufficient or of low reliability, yield a series of interesting trends of opinions whose further analysis has been presented at the 5th General Meeting of VET2020 held in Toulouse on May 24, 2003 (Seminarium on ''Future directions for veterinary education''). The analysis of the data emanating from the survey shall constitute the basis for the Final Report of the VET2020 project, to be ready for deliverance to the Commission by the project Co-ordinator following the 6th General Meeting (Lisbon, September 20, 2003) . From the Nomisma report, the overall opinion (by all target groups surveyed) signalled the veterinary profession is not expected to decrease its present level of engagement among European professions, neither in terms of needs (employers and consumer organisations) nor expectations (consumer organisations, professional organisations, professionals, etc.) . Professionals regarded veterinary education as dynamic, and could foresee -according to the survey -changes in the curricula that better adapt to expected needs of the market. Among these, the survey identified the continuation of a good, yet perhaps diversified and much more specialised clinical training; as well as an increase in the training of particular issues of utmost importance for the protection of consumers' health, such as food quality and safety or veterinary public health. Among the employers and, particularly, the consumers' associations (the ones the market listen carefully to), areas such as veterinary public health, including herd-health and surveillance were among those predicted to harbour the highest opportunity for employment by 2020. As a whole, even noting the presence of regional and national differences, the survey clearly marked the need for adaptations of the curricula in veterinary training so that they best convey to the expectations of the responders, eventually leading to a stronger harmonisation among the establishments of veterinary education in Europe.",

Inclusion of new subjects, attempting the elimination of the sacred limits between disciplines are now more common, and we use more extramural training and elective courses or activities to be able to cope with the requirements of society. Accompanied with proper didactics, the clinical subjects have evolved from treating individuals to think more globally, involving societal needs, animal welfare, economics and epidemiological aspects. Classical subjects, such as food hygiene, are now widened into Veterinary Public Health for instance, and population medicine, herd health and surveillance are now developing away from the classical clinics of individual food-producing animals.",

Defining a core curriculum provides larger benefits when a PBL-learning strategy has been applied at the beginning of the veterinary programme. Problem-based learning involves the use of clinical problems (sometimes cases, but these can very well be of a population nature rather than individual) in order to create an active, student-centred learning environment. Considering that most veterinary problems often require an interdisciplinary approach, students learn how to study basic and clinical sciences in an integrated fashion. This training of how to learn should be easily made permanent by the student, since it does not have to be maintained in the programme scheme along the curriculum, but rather be applied by the students themselves after passing the pre-clinical period. Particular advantages of an early application of PBL-strategies are the self-direction of learning, obtaining interdisciplinary knowledge, as well as the development of personal skills, including personal communication skills. Both analytical and technical/clinical skills need to accompany this approach of learning, particularly with proper hands-on training. However, educators must be convinced that the PBL-strategy is not just another fancy method of instruction but a new philosophy of education, focusing on the students' own work, so that they can grow as independent learners.",

There is a society-driven increment in the diversity of species which veterinarians working as clinicians are to be consulted about, and farm animal clinics evolve towards preventive medicine, including issues of herd-health surveillance and risk assessment rather than the classical handling of individual illnesses.

Elective periods, often at the end of a common part of the curriculum and lasting a few weeks to 1 or even 2 semesters, help the students to identify an area of particular interest and deepen into it. The area can include courses (either of narrow or broad nature) or activities (primarily skill-training in a particular subject or series of subjects). In some cases, elective periods are associated (with advantage) to the task of pursuing a project work, also in a subject the student selected by her/himself. The introduction of elective periods is a good measure aiming at reducing the omnicompetence we have discussed above, but it has shown deviations (add-ons) and it does not necessarily limit the core per se. Tracking implies a new type of curriculum design, where the student opts to emphasise a specific area of veterinary medicine, so that a considerably enhanced level of knowledge is achieved at graduation. Even not being a specialisation (a level that would be obtained after graduation) tracking takes the student to a more useful level of competence in that particular chosen field, limiting redundant information and facilitating a more focused learning. Its major argument is that it limits information overload in the curriculum. However, tracking is not common yet, and many concerns have been raised in establishments that have opted to consider this option. Firstly, it complicates an already rather complex veterinary curriculum and forces the decision by young students (maturity is not an issue to be discussed here, but it has been named) to opt for a track, sometimes rather early in the curriculum. Tracking is at the very end a decision to be made by a certain establishment in the light of the socio-economic values and needs for veterinary professionals. In some areas (as is the case of University of California at Davis, USA) the practising veterinarian has clearly evolved from an omni-competent, primary healthcare provider for several species, to a single species health specialist, a disciplinary specialist or even a species-specific discipline specialist. However, there are many regions of the world where the predominant need still is for omni-competent, multispecies veterinarians.",

Obvious differences exist among establishments, inherent of a European perspective, both in terms of facilities, input/output (students/graduates), numbers of teaching and support staff, accessibility to teaching material etc, all of which can cause eventual differences among the graduates.",

The FVE, as a professional organisation, has earlier focused on issues of veterinary demography (Document FVE 00/011) as a major threat to the quality of veterinary education in Europe. However, such a focus on 39 issues of veterinary students or numbers of graduates among the EU has not impacted per se on the quality of training of the establishments, since the latter has not been taken direct account of, a matter for lengthy, not always constructive, discussions between EAEVE and FVE. The FVE, again acting as the professional organisation it is, focused on threats such as higher rates of veterinary under-or unemployment and the question of an over migration of veterinarians, as those causing damage to the profession. The first mentioned issue is a reality in some countries, where the number of establishments of veterinary training exceeds the expectations of the internal market. Their existence sometimes follows short-sighted political agendas (statistical treatment of unemployment, excessive offer of undergraduates without the demand of a market) or expression of regional autonomy, etc. The second issue is unsubstantiated for most of the EU, exception made of few countries, where large numbers of veterinarians cross the borders to provide services or establish themselves, following EU established laws (Rodriguez-Martinez, unpublished survey). Other matters, such as changes in gender balance, are a worldwide reality, and not necessarily related to the quality of undergraduate teaching.",

We need only add some data to realise that the veterinary world is in an extremely dangerous high-risk situation that requires immediate intervention. It is unacceptable that in the EU one veterinarian out of six is Italian, that 26.6% of veterinary medicine students are Italian, and that almost 20% of veterinary medicine faculties are located in Italy, but that in spite of this we are not even in the top rankings in Europe for zootechnic resources, for either pets or farm animals.

Occupational growth forecasts for 2020 are low in percentage terms for our sector, whereas total members of the professional rolls are set to double by 2020 unless we take immediate action. In this extremely difficult situation, we consider it unthinkable that the Italian university system be augmented by another degree course in veterinary medicine, in a university such as Catanzaro which does not achieve the minimum 46 faculty requirements provided for by the Ministry in terms of its existing faculties, and which totally lacks all the equipment necessary for a veterinary medicine faculty.

In fact, in 2020 the professional scenario will be characterised by an excess of professionals who will inevitably have to compete in a market characterised by limited demand (i.e. decreasing employment growth).

The transformation process leading to new farming methods, which enabled farmers to go beyond the local sphere of activity and handmade production, was triggered in the second half of the 1980s by the introduction of a new species and a new technique. The introduction into lagoon areas of the mid-Adriatic Sea of Manila clam (T apes philippinarum) resulted in an excellent adaptation of this new species to the local environment, to the extent that it spread spontaneously and allowed farmers to move from rearing practices to management of production areas in a more or less controlled way. This allowed farmers to benefit from a resource that completely changed the production structure of the areas involved in this process, with significant social repercussions.",

Mollusc defense systems and their state of integrity also represent a suitable biomarker in the monitoring of polluted sites; for example, several studies indicated the possibility of a correlation between high metal levels and low rates of phagocytosis and, possibly, between release of high levels of oxygen radicals and low background of organic contaminants (Pipe et al., 1995) .

Lysosomal enzymes also possess digestive function as indicated by their abundance in the stylus and digestive gland. In fact, digestive and defense functions could act contemporaneously because filtered bacteria represent nourishment for marine bivalves, so enzymes present in the digestive tract hydrolyze microorganisms performing both functions at the same time. Agglutinins have been found in many mollusc tissues and these glycoproteins act as opsonins against different types of erythrocytes (hemagglutinins) and other cells such as bacteria, protozoa and algae (Chu, 1988) . Lectins represent agglutinin-like molecules and are present in the hemolymph and in the hemocyte membrane; they have a specific opsonizing function in mollusc defense mechanisms such as hemocyte aggregation and foreign cell agglutination. In particular, lectins are specific for hemocyte and bacteria glycoconjugates, so promoting recognition of foreign cells. However, the biological significance of the different carbohydrate specificities is not yet known, in fact most invertebrate lectins are heterogeneous and may also bind other ligands (Tunkijjanukij et al., 1998) . Antimicrobial peptides have been discovered in hemolymph and mussel hemocytes, and have been classified as defensins, mytilins, myticins and mytimycin. These compounds act on a rather broad spectrum of microbial organisms and their activity has been shown outside hemocyte or in phagocytosed bacteria (Mitta et al., 2000) .",

Mollusc hemocytes also have important functions in transport of nutrients, wound repair, and removal of catabolic products or pollutants (Feng, 1988) . Hemocytes can be generally subdivided into two main types: hyalinocytes, small cells with poor cytoplasm containing few or no granules; and granulocytes, large cells with a very abundant granular cytoplasm. Granulocytes are those most responsible for phagocytosis and they can be classified into acidophilic, basophilic and neutrophilic cells. The presence of these two hemocyte types and, possibly, of their subpopulation has been demonstrated through microscopic, immunological and enzymatic analysis in several molluscs such as Mytilus edulis, M. galloprovincialis, Mercenaria mercenaria, Ruditapes decussatus, Ostrea edulis, Crassostrea virginica, Cr. gigas (Hine, 1999) . Different hemocyte types isolated from many molluscs have the common characteristic of phagocytosing foreign cells or particles using lysosomal enzymes and respiratory burst. Mollusc hemocytes respond to appropriate stimuli with a respiratory burst resembling that of mammalian phagocytes. The respiratory burst activity consists of ROS synthesis. Superoxide, the hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, hypohalides, halidamines, nitric oxide and the peroxynitrite anion represent 59 the most important ROS and all are very strong oxidants. ROS production during phagocytosis of immune stimulant yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), laminarin, phorbol miristate acetate and microbial LPS has been demonstrated for many different mollusc hemocytes such as Patinopecten yessoensis, Pecten maximus, Cr. virginica, Cr. gigas, O. edulis, Mya arenaria, M. mercenaria, M. edulis (Roch, 1999) , M. galloprovincialis (Arumugam et al., 2000) , and R. decussatus (Tafalla et al., 2003) . However, the exact role of ROS production remains to be clarified in natural and experimental infections with important mollusc pathogens (Roch, 1999) . In fact, O. edulis and Cr. gigas hemocyte do not show LuCL during Bonamia ostrae ingestion. In vitro studies have shown that Cr. virginica hemocytes fail to produce LuCL during Perkinsus marinus phagocytosis, but the addition of osmotically killed and structurally intact Perkinsus sp. cells triggered a large LuCL response, comparable to that shown with other foreign particles such as zymosan (Anderson, 2001) . M. galloprovincialis hemocytes do not produce LuCL during stimulation with V ibrio tapetis and Perkinsus-like organisms (Pseudoperkinsus tapetis) (Ordas et al., 2000) .",

Lysosome-phagosome fusion was not observed in hemocytes infected with Bonamia sp. and the lack of fusion may be due to membraneous vesicles originating from parasite lipoid bodies (Hine et al., 1994) . Bonamia sp. is mainly phagocytosed by agranular hemocytes and the higher resistance shown by some oyster strains to the disease is attributed to a reduced number of these target cells, thus suggesting the possibility of producing less susceptible oyster broodstock (Naciri-Graven et al., 1998) . The parasite P. marinus is responsible for widespread mortalities in oysters Cr. virginica farmed along most of the U.S. Atlantic coast. Oyster mortality usually peaks in late summer-autumn when combined high temperature (>25\u00b0C) and high salinity (at least 12%) favor development of heavy infections (Oliver et al., 1998) . High environmental temperatures affect and modify cellular and humoral activities and, at the same time, increase the metabolic activity of the parasite; so, the rate of killing may not be sufficient to cope with Perkinsus sp. multiplication (Chu et al., 1993) . Some authors report that P. marinus actively produces factors that act as free radical scavengers or as inhibitors of ROS generation by Cr. virginica hemocytes (Anderson, 2001) . In contrast Cr. gigas is not susceptible to P. marinus disease and it is hypothesized that the capacity of Cr. gigas to increase its protease inhibitors represents the key event in its resistance to parasite infection by neutralization of proteases secreted by P. marinus, thus preserving the oyster hemagglutinins from degradation. Such hemagglutinins will be ready to act as opsonins stimulating phagocytosis of parasites (Romestand et al., 2002) .",

In particular, the hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite anion have the most important role in protein denaturation. Damages on polypeptide chains evoke the synthesis of HSPs, both in host and in pathogen to repair denaturated proteins and to protect their respective 60 proteic pool from possible denaturation. A significant 70 kDa HSP synthesis in M. galloprovincialis hemocytes during V ibrio alginolyticus phagocytosis has been demonstrated, while Escherichia coli determines only a small increase in HSP 70. These results are explained by the different phagocytosis rates derived from the different mollusc behaviour on interaction with bacteria coming from dissimilar environments and confirm the existing relationship between phagocytosis and HSPs production (Tiscar et al., 1998) . Furthermore, the diversity in HSPs expression at conditions of high environmental temperatures seems to be an important factor promoting pathogenicity in the P. marinus-Cr. virginica relationship (Tirard et al., 1995) . Moreover, among the possible pollution biomarkers, the HSPs expression in molluscs has been proposed because the synthesis of these proteins is likely to be induced by a large number of chemicals (Bierkens, 2000) .",

ACTH has been revealed in M. edulis hemolymph stimulated with LPS and selected ACTH fragments seem to modulate the mobility of hemocytes and, in parallel, to contrast stimulation of hemocytes with TNF-a. ProDyn and proEnk-like proteins have been characterized in M. edulis and proEnk, in particular, contain antimicrobial peptides such as enkelityn or peptides similar to peptide B and bovine amidorphin. The endocannabinoids receptor system has also been characterized in the mussel, together with opioids system. In fact, mussel hemocytes seem to possess a cannabinoid 1 receptor-like related to nitric oxide release. Briefly, peptide opioids give an amoeboid morphology to hemocytes, while the endocannabinoid anandamide inhibits this phenomenon through a nitric oxide dependent mechanism (Salzet and Stefano, 2002) . The cytokines represent the most important immune mediators, playing an essential role in mechanisms such as cell multiplication and differentiation, apoptosis and cytotoxicity. IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a have 61 been isolated in M. edulis. IL-1 and TNF-a influence the mobility of M. edulis hemocytes and an increase in IL-1-like molecules has been shown during contact of hemocytes with a synthetic opioid analogous to methionine enkephalin (Stefano et al., 1999; Ottaviani et al., 1997) .",

In Italy it was detected in farmed T apes philippinarum (Ceschia et al., 1991) and in several wild mollusc species: T . decussatus and V. aureus (Da Ros et al., 1985 , 1986 Breber, 1985) ; O. edulis (Tiscar et al., 1992) , Chamelea gallina (Rubini et al., 1996) and Callista chione (Canestri-Trotti et al., 2000) . Recent genetic studies have shown that P. atlanticus is similar to P. olseni which infects several Haliotis species farmed in Australia, New Zealand, etc. The mollusc can probably be infected by every developmental stage of the parasite, although the most effective stages are probably trophozoites and zoospora. The parasite reaches the host's connective tissue by lysis of the basal lamina of the external epithelia (gills, mantle, digestive gland, as well as kidney, foot, gonads, intestine) or may be spread through the hemolymph. Infected molluscs do not normally present any clear external clinical characteristics, but in the case of a serious infection where the subjects may be present pale pulp colouring and weak consistency, greyish gills due to the presence of whitish nodules (parasitical cysts) may be observed.",

However assessments by the ASSOMITILI (the most important producers association) show a real production of around 30,000 quintals. These data highlight the notable difference between the potentiality of the fittings and the declared production. Therefore a notable quantity of product is introduced into the market illegally without sanitary controls.

In the case of production areas the requirements are similar to those fixed by Directive CE 492/91. In addition permitted treatment methods are specified, such as sterilisation in hermetically sealed containers and heat treatment, that live bivalve molluscs must undergo to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms, when they have not been submitted to purification or relaying. In addition food business operators must not produce live bivalve molluscs in, or harvest them from, areas that the competent authority has not classified, or which are unsuitable for health reasons. Food business operators must take into account any relevant information concerning areas suitable for production and harvesting, including information on environmental and weather conditions. They must use this information to determine the appropriate treatment to apply to harvested batches. For harvesting and handling after harvesting food business operators 72 have to conform to other requirements, such as adequate protection of live bivalve molluscs from crushing, abrasion or vibration and against extreme temperatures and preventing their re-immersion in water that could cause additional contamination. When carrying out conditioning in natural sites, they have to use only areas that the competent authority has classified as being of class A. There must be a minimum distance between relaying areas, and also between relaying areas and production areas, so as to minimise any risk of the spread of contamination. The food business operator must use techniques for handling live bivalve molluscs intended for relaying that permit the resumption of filter-feeding activity after immersion in natural waters. The relaying period must be fixed depending on the water temperature. This period must be of at least two months' duration unless the competent authority agrees to a shorter period on the basis of the food business operator's risk analysis. The 'all in, all out' system must be used, so that a new batch of molluscs cannot be brought in before the whole of the previous batch has been removed.",

The lower incidence of calls concerning cats may be attributed to the more ''prudent'' feeding habits characterising this species together with its tendency to stay by itself when feeling ''sick'': this happens especially for individuals living in country areas or in a semi-domestic state.

            "text": "A breakdown of all enquiries by class of chemicals is depicted in Table I . Veterinary and, to a far lesser extent, human drugs are responsible for the greatest percentage of calls in both species: namely 23% for dogs and 35% for cats. Within this class, antiparasitic compounds account for (as many as) 64% and 79% of the calls in dogs and cats, respectively, followed by non steroidal antiinflammatory agents (10% for dogs and 7% for cats). The majority of the enquiries concerning antiparasitic drugs refer to principles active against external parasites, such as pyrethroids and organophosphorus compounds or carbamates. In most cases misuse by the animal's owners or the accidental ingestion of commercial preparations such as collars, powders or sprays containing such compounds has been the cause of poisoning. In this respect it is worth noting that, on a percentage basis, pyrethroids (mostly permethrin) account for nearly half of the calls concerning this subclass in the cat, thereby confirming the particular sensitivity of this species toward these derivatives (Martin and Campbell, 2000) . According to our data, the improper use of ivermectin (49 calls) may still represent a problem not only for Collie dogs, which are reported to be most susceptible to this drug but also for other dog breeds as well as cats (Nelson et al., 2003) . Chlorpyriphos (47 calls for dogs and 12 for cats), Amitraz (38 calls for dogs), and Fipronil (28 calls for dogs and 21 for cats) are the subject of a significant number of inquiries; the latter is normally very well tolerated but multiple applications of very Continued high dosages (particularly to puppies and kittens) may give rise to nervous stimulation which is related to the blocking of GABA receptors brought about by this drug (Hainzl et al., 1998) . As regards the NSAIDs, ibuprofen, paracetamol, and aspirin account for the majority of the inquiries for dogs, and paracetamol and aspirin for cats, which are highly sensitive to these drugs. In most cases animals were poisoned as the result of the accidental ingestion of tablets intended for human therapy. Finally, hormones and psychoactive drugs are implicated in a small percentage of calls in dogs (4%), the former class being entirely represented by oestrogen-based oral contraceptives, the latter by hashish (15 calls) and Cannabis indica (11 calls). Agrochemicals are responsible for a significant percentage of enquiries for both species (19% of the total calls for dogs, 14% for cats). Insecticides are the most represented class (40% for the dog, 55% for the cat). For dogs the most implicated compounds are carbamates, especially Methomyl (39 calls) and Carbaryl (22 calls), organophosphorus compounds with particular regard to Diazinon (28 calls) and Malathion (21 calls), and organochlorine compounds, with 31 calls regarding Endosulfan. For both species, fungicides account for nearly one-fourth of the calls of the agrochemical class and the majority of these (43% for dogs and 52% for cats) are related to the accidental ingestion of copper sulphate. As regards herbicides, the most represented active principles for both species are Paraquat (47 calls for dogs and 5 for cats), mostly as the result of malicious poisonings, and Glyphosate (85 calls for dogs and 14 for cats), which is usually reported to affect animals ingesting grass and vegetation recently sprayed with a glyphosate-based commercial preparation. In this respect it should be noted that a surfactant present in many liquid preparations may be responsible for most of the reported toxic effects, including vomiting, diarrhoea, and nervous symptoms (Burgat et al., 1998) .",

The higher incidence displayed by the canine species over the feline one is most likely attributable to the less selective feeding habits of dogs coupled with the malicious use of these compounds as baits. Anticoagulants account for the majority of these calls, especially in dogs (77%), with an extremely significant role played by the so called ''second generation'' molecules, particularly Bromadiolone (109 calls for dogs and 11 for cats) and Brodifacoum (89 calls for dogs and 4 for cats), which are far more dangerous than those belonging to the ''first generation'' (e.g. Warfarin) because they may cause fatal poisonings even after a single exposure (Petrus and Henik, 1999) . Older but still largely employed rodenticides like zinc phosphide (52 calls) and strychnine (39 calls) still represent a considerable threat to dogs.",

Nonetheless, the collected data indicate how dangerous the misuse of the veterinary drugs can be (in particular that of external antiparasitic agents), since they represent as many as one third and one fourth of the total calls for cats and dogs, respectively. The potential danger of certain agrochemicals and of many cleaning products also has to be stressed. Finally, one should also emphasize the high incidence of calls related to second generation anticoagulant rodenticides.

            "text": "For the categories of toxics responsible for poisoning pesticides are the highest class, followed by household products, drugs, plants, industrial products and animal poisonings. The class ''other'' includes abuse substances, food, and cosmetics. Rodenticides (36%) are most responsible for intoxication in the class of pesticides, followed by insecticides (25.6%), herbicides (24.3%), fungicides (8.1%) and molluscicides (6%). The ''households'' class consists of detergents, but also batteries, solvents and thermometers. Industrial chemicals including fuels, heavy metals and ethylene glycol represents the causative agent most involved in the dog. 74% of the cases of the toxic agent happen in the domestic environment, either in the house or outside (garden). 13.5% of poisonings happen outside the domestic environment (open space). Only a small percentage of intoxications have been verified in the place of work or in public places. Respect to the frequency of exposure, 71% of the subjects came into contact with the toxin only once, 3.5 more than once, and the frequency was unknown for the remaining 25.5%. The occurrence reliability, that is the assurance of the owner of exposure to the toxin, was certain for 51.4% of cases, probable for 27.3% and unknown for 21.3% of the intoxications. The cause of intoxication was accidental for 81.92%, iatrogenic for 3.32%, fraudulent for 2.58% and unknown for 12.18% of cases. The most frequent route of intoxication was by ingestion and was not reported on the schedule for 6.9%. 52% of the subjects were not tested by laboratory analysis; and we did not receive information for 29.5%. The result was reported for 46.8% of cases, with recovery for 42%, permanent disability for 1.3% and in 3.5% of the cases the animals died. The toxicological risk was assessed as ''high'' for 14.5%, ''medium'' for 16%, ''low'' for 8.2%, ''not excluded'' 28%, ''excluded'' 10.6%, while for 22.7% this was not assigned. Comparing the incidence of the type of poisoning in this investigation with the previous survey, where pesticides were the most frequent poisoning class, it has been observed that this is now the rodenticides. From the analyzed data it appears that zinc phosphide is a frequent causative agent of intoxication in 91 dogs. Poisoning by plants is also increased as compared with the last survey of the CAV. Intoxication by plants took place in the garden, and oleander was the most responsible plant, in the flat Euphorbia Pulcherrima was the most involved, once again in dogs. Under the class ''drugs'' we intend only products for human use, imprudently left by the owner within reach of animals. Some of these intoxications showed a seasonal trend, like the increase in intoxications by antihistaminic drugs in spring. The comparison between dogs and cats demonstrates that for the cat the domestic environment, in the house, is the place were intoxications most easily happen (62.5%). This could be related to the life-style of these animals. In Italy cats living in urban areas normally do not have the possibility to go outside from the house. The most frequent route of exposure to toxins is by ingestion. It is very important to underline that for 53.2% of cases the result of the intoxications remained unknown, despite our strict follow-up. We can conclude that our investigation for 2000-2002 related to the intoxications in Northern Italy, gave important and useful results for operators and demonstrated the utility of ongoing collaboration with the Poison Control Center, University, Veterinarians, and other organizations to give rapid and efficient therapeutic aid, and also to create a up-to-date database of intoxications in domestic animals.",

Rodenticide poisonings caused by anticoagulants are less frequent; however they still show a high positivity. With these accidental poisoning seems more probable, due to struggles against rodents. As regards the frequency of poisoning due to zinc phosphide, its incidence is not particularly high and remains the same during the entire period taken into consideration. 92 Metaldehyde poisoning (percentage of positivity of 11% in 1999) has increased over the years, reaching 31% in the first six months of 2003. Metaldehyde is a much-used molluscicide and is easily available, whose use has increased to prepare poisoned baits. A particular case is represented by strychnine which is known as a very dangerous poison widely used in the 80s: this now justifies the high number of requests.

One of the most important causes of the high frequency of intoxication in the dog is its tendency to eat everything around it, unlike the cat which is extremely suspicious towards any unfamiliar compound. Another important source of poisoning in the dog is malicious poisoning, which seems to be related to the hunting season when animals are taken to areas where they are not welcome.

Even intoxications in the month of September are very frequent, coinciding with the opening of the hunting season. In this period poisoned baits are usually spread to exterminate the natural predators of the game (foxes etc) or to damage competitors.

The average percenrage of vets requesting specific analysis in the other southern regions was about 50%, falling to 35.3% for Sicily and 9.1% for Sardinia. Such results are probably related to the lack of specific laboratories in these areas or to the tendency of vets to use only their own experience to perform diagnoses. However, it is important to note that many toxic substances produce similar neurological symptoms, highlighting the very real importance of specific analysis in differentiation of causes of poisoning. Without analysis, there is a particularly frequent confusion between OP poisoning and other neurotoxic substances, which are, thus, less frequently signalled and revealed. While we can observe a seasonal incidence for OP poisonings, for AC, MET and STR poisoning this was not observed. Even if MET is currently used in agriculture during spring and autumn, the constant presence and referral of MET poisoning is related to bait frequently prepared to criminally poison dogs and cats. We also found a correlation between agricultural practices and incidence of some poisonings. Particularly in Puglia the diffusion of permanent cultivation justifies the 1.3% of paraquat poisoning observed. Conversely, less intensive soil utilization in Molise is in accordance with the low frequency of OP poisoning. In Sicily, where 95 permanent cultivation is widely practised, OP poisoning is very frequent, representing the highest percentage observed (48.2%). For Abruzzo region, following previous studies, we were able to benefit from the data from the lab of the Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise ''G. Caporale''. Toxic substances more often reported by vets were AC and OP while other compounds were reported less. These data confirm the trend observed in a previous work performed during the period 1997-2000 in the Abruzzo region where the percentages of poisonings signalled were 79.2% for AC, 69.4% for OP, 38.9% for MET and 37.5% for STR. Interestingly it can be observed that only 0.8% of samples were positive for AC. This result is probably related to the ability of veterinarians to diagnose AC poisoning directly from anamnesis and clinical symptoms, without the necessity to refer to the lab, while for the other compounds the veterinarians usually sent samples to IZS to confirm the poisoning.",

Successively, we received baits that contained two different toxic substances. This expedient may have been carried out in order to hide pathognomonic symptoms due to a single toxic substance and, consequently, to confuse the veterinarian in detoxification therapy practice. The most evolved bait was found a few months ago: an original in vivo bait (Meucci et al., 2003) . A clay-like matrix (analysed to be a mixture of pirimicarb and endosulfan) was inserted in the subcutaneous tissue of the neck region of a female pheasant and the animal was tied to a tree. The skin close to the subcutaneous implant contained several stitches. It is important to note that whoever prepared the above-mentioned bait is able to use anaesthetic drugs (if they have been used) and to apply stitches.

FSH causes an increase in granulosa cell numbers, oestradiol and inhibin synthesis, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) production and growth of the follicle. The secretion of FSH is constitutive, resulting in its secretion into the blood stream following synthesis. GNRH plays a role in FSH secretion because immunization of heifers against it suppresses its secretion (Crowe, 1999) .

Following the LH/FSH pre-ovulatory surge in cattle, oestradiol concentrations decline and progesterone concentrations in follicular fluid increase as granulosa cells develop LH receptors and begin the transition to luteal cells. This peri-ovulatory decrease in oestradiol and inhibins results in an increase in FSH concentrations (Adams et al., 1992; Sunderland et al., 1994) and the emergence of the first follicle wave on days 1 to 3 of the oestrous cycle.

Specifically, the dominant follicle has an enhanced capacity to produce oestradiol as it reaches 8-9 mm in diameter, an increased amount of FSH receptors and/or its mRNA in granulosa cells by 11-12 mm in diameter.

These factors are synthesized locally in follicles, are regulated at least partially by FSH and may have important autocrine or paracrine roles in modulation of FSH action and hence, follicular growth and function. Potential intrafollicular factors involved in follicle selection were identified by aspirating follicular fluid from multiple individual follicles from the same heifer. The future dominant follicle was associated with highest oestradiol content in follicular fluid and the absence of detectable levels of IGFBP-4 (Mihm et al., 2000) . FSH plays a key role in inducing the aromatase enzyme system in bovine granulosa cells. This suggests that the future dominant follicle is more sensitive to FSH due perhaps to increased FSH receptors or enhanced cell signal transduction mechanisms required for continued oestrogen synthesis. In addition, the lower IGF-B4 4 levels should result in increased bioavailability of IGFs within the follicular fluid, which should lead to proliferation of and increased FSH receptors on granulosa cells, increased oestradiol synthesis and maintain the health of the follicle. Rhodes et al. (2001) showed that selection of the dominant follicle was related to increased aromatase activity, increased cycle AMP in response to LH, increased oestradiol synthesis and decreased concentrations of IGFBP-4 and 5 within two days of ovulation. Thus, the bioavailability of IGFs is a key determinant of follicle development and survival in cattle.",

            "text": "In summary, our work (Austin et al., 2001) shows that selection of a dominant follicle from a pool of growing antral follicles is a dynamic process regulated by interactions of the gonadotrophins and intraovarian factors. Following the increase in circulating FSH concentrations, follicles of 2.5-5 mm in diameter are stimulated to grow. At this time, the five largest follicles per heifer have similar amounts of oestradiol, IGFBPs, activin-A, follistatin, and percentage of apoptotic granulosa cells. By 33 h after the peak in FSH, the two largest follicles increase in size and continue to grow while FSH concentrations decline. In addition, these follicles gain an enhanced capacity to produce oestradiol, inhibin precursors, and activin-A, but begin to lose the ability to produce follistatin while maintaining low amounts of IGFBP-2, -4, and 5 and a low percentage of apoptotic granulosa cells compared with the other follicles in the cohort. By 53 h after the peak in FSH, a dominant-like follicle can be distinguished in the cohort based on its largest size, highest oestradiol, and lowest amount of IGFBPs, though functional dominance, i.e., suppression of growth of all other cohort follicles has not yet been established. At 84 h after the peak in FSH, the selected dominant follicle is the largest follicle in the cohort, it is approximately 10 mm in diameter and contains the highest amounts of ostradiol and the lowest amount of IGFBPs and follistatin compared with the other follicles in the cohort. In contrast, the remaining follicles in the cohort (F2, F3, F4 and F5), though continuing to grow until 84 h after the peak in FSH, reach smaller maximum diameters of 5.5-8.5 mm. Thus, follicular growth is characterized by 1) increases in follicular diameter, oestradiol, and at least initially in inhibin and activin-A production; 2) a decrease in follistatin; and 3) maintenance of low amounts of low molecular weight IGFBPs and a low percentage of apoptotic granulosa cells. Follicles in the wave destined to become atretic are characterized by loss of capacity to produce oestradiol and enhanced production of low molecular weight IGFBPs. These changes not only precede atresia but also occur before the cessation of follicular growth. Based on these results the earliest intrafollicular changes that distinguish a follicle destined to become dominant from the other follicles in growing cohort are enhanced capacity to produce oestradiol and maintenance of low levels of IGFBPs.

            "text": "Herd reproductive efficiency is a major component leading to the economic success of the commercial dairy production unit. The modern day lactating dairy cow is considered to be sub-fertile in which the physiological stresses of high production and current management systems have a negative impact on both estrus detection and fertility. The high levels of milk production, dry matter intake, nutritional status, and metabolism of the cow appear to have altered both ovarian follicle development and luteal status. These alterations have contributed to low rates of estrus detection, increased multiple ovulations, and reduced embryo survival. With our current understanding of the factors controlling ovarian follicular dynamics and CL function, systems to manipulate the ovary for timed insemination, re-synchronization of timed inseminations for cows that do not conceive, and strategies to improve embryo survival have been developed to improve reproductive performance. Pharmacological control of the estrous cycle involves synchronization of follicular development that is coupled with the timely induction of corpus luteum (CL) regression, and synchronization of ovulation to improve pregnancy rate. Veterinarians and producers need to understand how these systems work in order to obtain compliance and optimal results. In lactating dairy cows the tools available for reproductive management are somewhat limited due to regulated use of such hormones as estradiol, GnRH, progestins, gonadotrophins and PGF 2a that varies among countries. Any use of a hormone should be in a manner that mimics normal physiological controls and responses of the reproductive system. Pregnancy rate (PR) of the herd is the proportion of pregnant cows relative to all eligible cows to become pregnant at every estrous cycle past the voluntary waiting period. Thus pregnancy rate is a function of estrus detection rate and conception rate. Ferguson and Galligan (1993) reported that PR at the first postpartum AI explained 79% of the variation in calving interval. It is also clear that after first insemination strategies need to be developed to identify and re-synchronize the non-pregnant cow in an efficient manner to achieve a 112 good herd pregnancy rate. Development of timed insemination programs with normal fertility has the ability to optimize service rate and thus improve PR in herds with low estrus detection rates. The challenge is to manipulate ovarian and embryo development in a manner to have an impact on conception rate and pregnancy losses. These two components that influence herd pregnancy rate are much more difficult to impact.",

A timed insemination is carried out at 12 to 16 h after the second GnRH injection (Fig. 1) . This protocol has been implemented very successfully in many commercial dairy farms world wide as a strategy for AI during the first postpartum service, as well as for re-insemination of non-pregnant cows. Although the Ovsynch protocol allows for TAI without the need for estrus detection, approximately 10 to 15% of the cows will display signs of estrus during the protocol and they should be inseminated promptly if maximum PR is to be achieved.",

Vasconcelos et al. (1999) noted that initiation of the Ovsynch protocol between days 5 and 9 of the cycle resulted in the highest ovulation rate in response to GnRH. Ovulation to the first GnRH injection and initiation of a new follicular wave should improve PR because an ovulatory follicle with a reduced period of dominance is induced to ovulate (Austin et al., 1999) . Furthermore, initiating the Ovsynch protocol prior to day 12 of the estrous cycle should minimize the number of cows that come into estrus prior to the 2nd GnRH injection and ovulate prior to the completion of the program. Moreira et al. (2001) designed a pre-synchronization protocol to optimize response to the Ovsynch program by giving two injections of PGF 2a 14 days apart, with the second injection given 12 days prior to the first GnRH of the TAI protocol (Fig. 2) . The Presynch-Ovsynch program increased pregnancy rates 18 percentage units (i.e., 25% to 43%); in lactating cyclic cows. Additional strategies to pre-synchronize in order to optimize the Ovsynch program are possible but need to be well thought out in order to minimize cows being in early metestrus or late diestrus when the Ovsynch program is initiated. Future programs for further optimization of fertility likely will consider programs that manipulate ovarian function such that follicular turnover via ovulation or induced follicular atresia occurs in all cows, and luteal phase like progesterone concentrations are sustained until the time of induced CL regression. These future systems in lactating dairy cows may include insertion of intravaginal devices containing progesterone and acute injections of estrogens. Success of the OvSynch program is dependent on whether lactating dairy cows are anestrus or cycling. Pregnancy rates were less in cows that were not cycling at the time the OvSynch program was initiated (e.g., 22% versus 42%). Overall, the TAI protocol was able to induce cycles in 75% of anestrous cows, based upon the number of anestrous cows which were classified as ovulating to either the first and/or second injection of GnRH. If anestrous cows ovulate to the first and second GnRH injections of the OvSynch program then pregnancy rates appeared to be normal (e.g., 39%). Insertion of progestin devices as part of the Ovsynch program (i.e., between GnRH and PGF 2a injections) may also benefit anestrous animals.",

Estrus occurred at 29.0\u00b11.8 h (n=28) after ECP, lasted for 12.5 h and was associated with an average of 20.3 mounts. Mean intervals to ovulation were 55.4\u00b12.7 h after ECP and 27.5\u00b11.1 h after onset of estrus. Since 75% of the ovulations occurred between \u226548 h to \u226472 h after ECP, it is recommended that any cow detected in estrus by 1.5 days after ECP injection be inseminated at detected estrus, and all remaining cows be inseminated at 48 h. Based on synchronization of ovulation and pregnancy rates, ECP can be utilized as an alternative to induce ovulation in place of GnRH for a 116 Figure 3 . Heatsynch protocol for timed AI timed insemination. Since lactating dairy cows have reduced concentrations of plasma estradiol in the preovulatory period and reduced intensity of estrus, the elevation of estradiol following ECP injection supplements for a lactational induced deficiency, and our experience indicates that cows expressing estrus are fertile. The secretion of LH is regulated directly by GnRH whereas estradiol induces LH secretion indirectly via a positive feedback stimulation of hypothalamic GnRH secretion that then stimulates LH secretion. If cows are anovulatory (e.g., anestrus or have not developed positive estradiol feedback) the Heatsynch program may not be as effective as the GnRH based OvSynch program in which GnRH causes the direct secretion of LH. Greater uterine tone, ease of insemination and occurrence of estrus with the use of the Heatsynch program are well received by inseminators. Alternatively, in facilities with concrete flooring, the reduced estrous expression associated with the OvSynch program may be preferred. Since fertility between the two programs appears to be comparable, producers have a choice, which also includes relative costs of drugs (i.e., ECP<GnRH).",

Since we still have cows without a corpus luteum despite the fact they received a GnRH injection 7 d prior to pregnancy diagnosis, alternative protocols are being evaluated for cows in metestrus, proestrus and with an ovarian cyst. Early detection of nonpregnant cows is crucial for enhancing reproductive performance. Cows with a CL at the time of diagnosis of nonpregnancy which were treated with GnRH 7 days earlier can be re-synchronized with PGF 2a followed by either ECP or GnRH. Cows are then TAI within 3 days of the non-pregnant ultrasound diagnosis. However, cows with CL at diagnosis of nonpregnancy which were not pre-treated with GnRH can be re-synchronized with protocols for TAI (Heatsynch and Ovsynch). In addition, ultrasound and rectal palpation allow for detection of reproductive tract abnormalities that will contribute to treatment and culling decisions. Future cow-side pregnancy tests may allow detection of nonpregnant cows at an early stage (e.g., day 23) so that re-synchronization protocols can be initiated only in cows known to be nonpregnant. Choosing the proper stage to initiate the program with GnRH (e.g., day 23) takes advantage of the re-occurring follicular wave and CL to reduce the time for re-insemination.",

Therefore, only animals with hypoplasic ovaries or in the immediate post-partum or late in pregnancy should be considered 122 unsuitable donors. Interestingly, certain ovarian pathological conditions such as ovarian cysts that often compromise the reproductive functions do not represent major obstacles for in vitro embryo production. Also pregnant animals can be good oocyte donors at least in the first months of pregnancy. General body conditions are important in determining the number of oocytes recovered and their subsequent successful development into viable embryos (see Table I ). The variability of the oocyte developmental competence observed amongst donors or batches of donors is great but probably not different from that observed in conventional ET. Certainly this variability is mostly dependent on nutrition and management of the animals (Kruip et al., 1995) and on the correlated physiological status. The common habit of feeding cattle diets high in degradable crude protein or in excess of requirements can reduce fertility and lower uterine pH (see Butler as review, 1998; Ocon and Hansen, 2003) . Recent studies have shown that high plasma levels of ammonia and urea correspond to increased concentrations in the reproductive tract and especially in the oviduct (Kenny et al., 2002) . The altered oviductal milieu is expected to cause profound disturbances to the developing conceptus since it is known that bovine embryos exposed to different culture environments can have altered level of expression of developmentally important genes .",

The most relevant is the follicular environment in which the oocyte has developed before collection. Primarily, the size of the follicle is very important, being correlated to the stage of oocyte development along the growth phase. The status of the follicle along the follicular wave, growing or regressing, and its consequent degree of atresia greatly affect oocyte development capacity (Galli and Moor, 1991) . A recent study in which oocytes were collected from cycling donors at precise stage in the cycle, has reiterated this concept by showing that oocyte quality is in fact the major factor that determines the efficiency of embryo production (see as review Lonergan et al., 2001) . On the other hand, more extensive studies on cycling animals with or without prestimulation with gonadotropins have shown that in general, but not always, prestimulated donors provide oocytes with higher developmental competence (see as review Hendriksen et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "At the beginning of the IVP technology all oocytes were collected from slaughtered donors but in recent years the Ovum Pick Up technique (OPU) has become a routine procedure . This technological advance has considerably widened the potential application of IVP by making it possible to couple assisted reproduction and genetic improvement in cattle. It consists of the transvaginal aspiration of follicular oocytes with the aid of a scanner with an adequate endovaginal (or adapted for the vaginal use) sector probe. A guided needle secured to the probe is connected to a test tube and to a vacuum pump to aspirate the follicular fluid and the oocyte contained in it. The donor is confined in a crush, mildly sedated and given an epidural anaesthesia just before collection. OPU has virtually no drawbacks for the donor and can even have a therapeutic effect in some infertile donors affected by ovarian cystic syndrome or similar pathologies that compromise reproductive function. Virtually any female starting from 6 months of age up to the third month of pregnancy and also soon after calving (2-3 weeks) , is a suitable donor (9). Young calves 2-3 monthsold can also be oocyte donors although collection requires surgical laparotomy. In Table II we present data from our laboratory to illustrate the influence of the age of donors on embryo production. Unlike conventional superovulation, OPU does not interfere with the normal reproduction and production cycles of the donor. OPU can be performed sporadically or on a regular basis such as two times a week for many weeks or months. The twice a week protocol is the one that yields the maximum number of competent oocytes in a given period of time. If irregular intervals of oocytes retrieval are used or if OPU is done once a week a dominant follicle develops (Garcia and Salaheddine, 1998) and this causes the atresia of subordinate follicles making them less suitable for embryo production because of the lower quality of the oocytes. A practical tip to overcome this problem or to avoid having a donor in estrus at the time of OPU, is to administer 3-4 days prior to collection a Gn-RH analogue to pharmacologically ablate the dominant follicle and to initiate a new follicular wave (our unpublished observations). Another advantage of OPU is that it is not necessary to treat the donor with gonadotropins with the inevitable side effects. This is a very important advantage especially for young heifers in which gonadotropin-stimulation can cause mammary oedema and ovarian cystic syndrome, and for show cows where repeated superovulation can cause relaxation of the udder ligament. However, a Canadian study has demonstrated that a combination of mild superovulatory treatment with FSH and OPU can increase the number of embryos produced in a given time, therefore representing a valid alternative to conventional superovulation 124 (Bousquet et al., 1999) . A final advantage of OPU is the possibility of using over a short time, or even on the same collection (when many oocytes are recovered), more sires to achieve in a short time several different dam-sire combinations. This is especially relevant for those donor cows of high genetics that are requested as sire's dams.",

A considerable body of knowledge has accumulated over the years on the biology of the bovine oocyte and reliable procedures are available in the literature to mimic the process of bovine oocyte maturation and fertilization in vitro. In general over 80% of the immature oocytes transferred in the commonest maturation medium, TCM 199 with 10% FCS and gonadotropins, complete maturation and around 70% of them are successfully fertilised. Following cleavage several different protocols can be employed to develop the early embryos up to the blastocyst stage. Co-culture systems and cell-free systems are used depending on the different laboratories and also an in vivo culture system, in the oviduct of sheep temporary recipients, is successful. As recently demonstrated by Lonergan et al. (2001) , the culture system applied from cleavage to blastocyst is the critical factor that affects embryo quality while, as mentioned above, it is the intrinsic oocyte quality that determines embryo yield. An interesting approach has been developed in the last few years to improve the quality of the oocytes through a prematuration culture period of 24-48 h, in presence of molecules capable of blocking the oocyte in the germinal vesicle stage. This method, generally referred to as two-step culture system, was expected to help the oocyte to complete its cytoplasmic capacitation during the prematuration step therefore improving its ability to undergo the following maturation and to develop into a viable embryo. Unfortunately, no improvement of developmental capacity has been demonstrated in oocytes subjected to prematuration. Interestingly however, this method has proven valuable to manipulate the timing of the maturation process during complicated procedures such as nuclear transfer (Lagutina et al., 2002) given that the embryos produced by the two-step culture system have normal viability (Ponderato et al., 2002) .",

Indeed, comparisons between findings in 1967 (Intrieri and Minieri, 1967 (Zicarelli et al., 1977 and 2000 show that there has been an increase in the fat (Fig. 3 ) and protein content of milk ( Fig. 4 ) both in the catabolic and anabolic phases of lactation. This may be attributed to the increase in energy of the diet (0.75 vs 0.9 UFL/kg D.M.) and protein density (11% vs 15%) obtained chiefly with the decrease in the amount of forage (90% vs 45-50%). Part of the increase in protein content occurring in recent years may also stem from the increase in milk urea content, although no correlations have emerged between proteins and milk urea (r=\u22120.08) or between urea and cheese yield (r=\u2212 0.10).",

This assumes major importance for buffalo farming as the herd, due to buffalo reproductive seasonality, changes the mean number of days in milk during the year and hence the milk may sometimes show higher values of MFP that do not stem from the addition of water. The increase in milk quality during recent years has also caused an increase in cheese yield as a significant correlation with milk protein content (r=0.47) has been demonstrated (Fig. 5) in experimental trials .",

In spite of its higher fat percentage, milk and mozzarella cholesterol content is lower for buffalo than for cow's milk (275 mg vs 330 mg and 1562 mg vs 2287 mg respectively). This is of major interest, together with some studies that report 131 a larger number of small fat globules in buffalo milk as compared to bovine and sheep milk. It is well known that small fat globules are rich in polyunsatured fatty acids (Martini et al., 2003) . Thanks to its higher dry matter content, buffalo milk has a higher cheese yield that, however, does not seem to be due solely to the different milk quality. For example, for each protein percent point more than 5 cheese yield points are obtained for buffalo and about 3 for cows even when milk is adjusted for the same caloric content. The difference is attenuated although it still persists if the cheese yield is adjusted for fat content (Table II) .",

This is a property which enables the presence of cow's milk to be detected (over to 5%) in the event of sophistication (Ferranti et al., 1996) . Moreover, due to a mutation, there is a phosphorylate residue instead of hydrophobic one, which is responsible for the enhanced non-polar nature of the buffalo protein. In contrast, in cow's milk a s1 casein has a phosphoseryl group in position 115 which is surrounded by hydrophobic amino acids. The absence of phosphoserin 115 in the a s1 casein of buffalo strengthens the non-polar nature of this protein (Ferranti et al., 1998) . The interaction of hydrophobic groups is probably responsible for the characteristics of the a s1 casein in the context of casein micelles. Finally, the loss of a phosphate group, the increase in density and higher sensitivity of buffalo casein micelles to chymosin may partly explain the shorter clotting time and the higher cheese yield of water buffalo as compared to bovine milk (Addeo et al., 1980) . The cheese-making potential of buffalo milk is also better than that of the cow due both to the higher casein content and the phosphorylation characteristics of a s2 casein: 10 and 11 phosphate groups/mole (in that it consists of two fractions) vs four respectively in buffalo and cow (Ferranti et al., 1996; Addeo et al., 1996) .",

The two variants A and B closely resemble cow's bA 2 casein, differing from the latter by four and five amino acids respectively. The b and a s1 casein fractions make up 70% of the micellar network of proteins. Hydrolysis of buffalo b casein with plasmin produces the fractions c 2 and c 3 . Thanks to the identification of fraction c 2 , it is possible to detect the presence (<1%) of cow's milk in buffalo mozzarella (Addeo et al., 1989) . Finally, the protein pattern of the two species differs in the smaller quantity of a s1 and b found in buffalo, as well as the larger quantity of k-casein and a s2 casein (Table III) . However, the absence of polymorphisms for a s1 , b 133 and the k casein, that is found for bovine milk, may suggest that there are no differences between milk of different buffalo populations and/or subjects. No differences have been found between buffalo and bovine variant B of b-lactoglobulin while some differences exist between the two species in the B variant of a-lactoalbumin. Recently a novel variant of a-lactoalbumin has been found, called A, that differs from the analogous bovine A variant in that it seems to contain less glucides.

The reference to a link with a certain geographic area is represented by the use of local forage for animal feeding and is greatly emphasized by the amendment to the MBC production regulation regarding milk processing, which stipulates that ''acidification of milk must be achieved by adding whey, derived from previous buffalo milk processing''. This technique does not enhance product shelf-life but is a characteristic which has distinguished MBC from other stretched curd cheeses and has underpinned its success.

This definition is perfectly suited to buffalo mozzarella. To develop such production, stress has been repeatedly laid on the ever-diminishing importance of price-based competitive strategies and the growing importance of strategies based on improvement and diversification of services and assortment. Increasingly, therefore, the operative and strategic choices of the large Italian and European distributors will be translated into an increase in available customer services, the creation of a more direct relationship between employees and consumers, and into planning a product range guided by new criteria. Of these, the regional product range is assuming considerable importance. Therefore, taking due account of further growth in the importance of large distribution and hence the greater importance of the rationale of modern trade, the sectors producing typical foodstuffs in traditional manner have to rethink their own strategic choices so as to take advantage of the chances offered by the new strategies of large distributors.

The calves of groups A and B, weaned at 63 d, received 6 l/head/d of acidified milk replacer (in the ratio of 180 g/l of water) until 42 d. Subsequently, the replacer amount was gradually decreased, whilst administering the same volume. The animals of groups C and D received 8 l/head/d of the same milk replacer, but in the ratio of 140 g/l, until 56 d. Also in this case the amount of replacer was gradually decreased, leaving the volume unchanged. Roughly chopped alfalfa hay and weaning concentrate were available from the fifth week; corn silage was administered starting from 70 d. 144 After weaning, the animals were fed ad libitum hay and corn silage; the concentrates were administered in the amount of 12 kg/d/group. The weaning age did not influence performance. By contrast, the weaning concentrate strongly affected the growth dynamics in the first 6 months: in this phase the concentrate with higher protein and starch content produced better results. However, in the subsequent period (6-16 months) due to compensative growth, improved performance was obtained using concentrates with less favorable characteristics. These observations suggest that concentrate with higher protein and starch content be administered during weaning, when the calves are destined to be slaughtered at lower weights compared to those reached in this trial (400 kg); otherwise it could be opportune to administer the protein-poor concentrate in order to limit feeding costs.",

In the interval 238-303 d, with a decreasing DM intake, group B showed lower DWG and worse CI. In the following interval, notwithstanding the increase in the DM intake, group B had similar results. On the contrary, between 380-415 d, group B had more favourable CI (UFV/kg weight gain 5.195 vs 4.452 for A and B) with slightly lower DWG (g 1143.0\u00b10.28 vs 1023.0\u00b10.14, for A and B). Group A showed the best results for the period 180-415 d, even if differences were not significant. Increasing the energy density of the diet in the interval 415-477 d slightly improved the total (180-477 d) DWG of group B, however less than that of group A (855.2\u00b10.58 vs 769\u00b10.25). Consequently, the total CI of group B was worse than that of the interval 180-415 d. Considering the whole trial, the buffalo growth curve showed a progressive increase in DWG, reaching its peak at 303 d of age (180 kg LW) until 415 d (300 kg LW). Successively the CI considerably worsened.",

As reported in Table I, due to the high price of buffalo milk, the utilization of dairy cow at the end of her productive career to wean two buffalo calves should be financially more favourable. This should produce economically more favourable results also compared with the administration of milk replacers, thanks to the compensation for the nurse by the EU.

All colour parameters decrease with age so the young buffalo bulls show a darker coloured meat, with a hue closer to magenta, but with less intensity (Table IV) . The measured tenderness (as Warner Bratzle shear force) on cooked meat, which is the best parameter for consumer appreciation, does not show differences according to age. The water holding capacity of raw meat, that strongly affects the choice of consumer at the moment of sale, is better for veal, while the difference is not important for cooked meat (Failla et al., 2001) .",

Its very good nutritional characteristics and the low number of subjects (considering a mean intercalving period of 400 days, the 120,000 cows actually bred in Italy could produce 96,000 calves of which 52% are males) are well appreciated by the consumer from a dietetic point of view as well as the fact that the sector is more controllable, in terms of food security. In our opinion, in order to further promote buffalo meat production and safeguard the consumer, a regulation providing only commercialization of subjects grown in the range of physiological weight gain should be prepared. The animal register of births could represent a good way of verifying if the slaughtering weight agrees with the aforementioned weight gains. The birth concentration in 6-7 months (using or not the out-of-breeding-mating strategy) could cause a discontinuous availability of meat on the market. This problem could be solved by slaughtering the subjects at different ages and modulating growth through the adoption of proper rationing schemes. In this case, the contemporary presence of animals with different ages should be taken into account planning the stalls in order to guarantee a good available space/head.",

The questionnaires investigated the owner's features (age, gender, education, marital status, job, features of the family, place of living, size of dwelling and social relations); the cat's features (age, gender, breed, neutered or spayed, age of adoption, source, whether it is living with other animals or not); the care given to the cat and the cat's behaviour (attachment to the owner, house soiling, behaviour towards strangers, cats and other animals). A veterinarian evaluated the cat's physical condition assessing only the nutritional status and ear condition, because in the previous study they were found to be objective indexes of physical condition. The aspects of the physical examination and the answers to the questionnaires regarding care and behaviour were codified on a score scale. The sum of the scores (total score) represented the index of the aspects considered (care given to the cat, cat behaviour and physical condition). The total scores were subjected to Spearman's Test to determine the correlation with the features both of the owner and the cat.",

In agreement with literature (Gregory, 1994; Holt et al., 1993) , it is clear that large subjects (>20 kg), more than those of small or medium size, showed a greater predisposition to the disease. It was also found that bitches that were overweight before spaying had 3.5 times more risk of developing the disease as compared with subjects that were not obese before and after surgery, confirming that obesity could be a predisposing factor for urinary incontinence. Oestrogen replacement therapy as treatment for after-spaying urinary incontinence, once the exact posology was found for each subject, induced a complete regression of symptoms, without the evidence of oestrogen-related side effects.",

Moreover, the biological transformations that take place at a molecular level during the process of capacitation and leading to acrosome reaction also seem to be dependent on both actin localization and its polymeric status (F-actin). In the pig, as for other species, cytoskeletal reorganization has been related to either release of the acrosomal content or the fertilization rate (Castellani-Ceresa et al., 1993; Liu et al., 2002) . It can be hypothesized that in the sperm the cytoskeleton acts as an organizer of specific domains on the plasma membrane. This arrangement occurs during the process of sperm maturation by interaction of the actin cytoskeleton with enzymatic or receptor proteins and/or fusogenic lipids in the membrane, allowing the translocation of specific molecules with antigenic properties to the sites where they are more directly involved in functional processes (AR, fusion etc.). On the basis of this knowledge, the authors have studied the process of capacitation in boar spermatozoa by modulating actin polymerization with cytochalasin D, a specific inhibitor of filament formation. In particular the effect of the actin cytoskeleton on a) acquisition of the capacitation pattern by CTC, and b) incidence of acrosomal exocytosis elicited in the sperm after exposure to zonae pellucidae proteins has been evaluated. Finally, the study has focussed on the major events taking place in the lag time from zona stimulation to acrosomal exocytosis, in particular i) the Ca waves triggered by the exposure of single sperm cells to solubilized ZP and ii) the localization of PLCc 1 , a membrane linked enzyme acting in the Ca-dependent transduction pathways of AR. 158 ",

The semen samples were then submitted to the following procedures: the capacitation levels achieved by the sperm were recorded using CTC, which identifies a specific fluorescent pattern depending on the functional status of the cells . Briefly, the sperm were incubated for 30 s with CTC 750 mM on a warm stage, then fixed in glutaraldehyde (0.4% v/v) and inspected under a fluorescent microscope. The percentage of AR recorded in the sperm exposed to solubilized ZP was detected after treatment of the samples with 95% ethanol by using FITC-conjugated PSA, a specific agglutinin which reacts with the acrosomal content of intact cells. The Ca levels after exposure to ZP were evaluated using a confocal microscope equipped with an argon laser on single cells with a kinetic program. In brief, after coincubating the samples with the membrane permeant, Ca sensitive dye Fluo4-AM, a drop of washed spermatozoa was placed into a registration chamber coated with poly-L-lysine to allow adhesion of the cells. After a few scans, solubilized ZP (1ZP/mL) were added to the chamber and the Ca signalling recorded. The localization of PLCc 1 was obtained by previously fixing (paraformaldeyde, 0.2%) and permeabilizing the cells (triton X-100, 0.1%); the sperm suspension was then incubated with anti PLCc 1",

In spite of the attainment of this capacitated pattern, when the sperm were challenged with solubilized ZP, for samples capacitated under control conditions 42-6% of the cells underwent AR, but only 12-0.5% of cyto D-treated sperm were able to complete the exocytotic event (Fig. 2) . The discrepancy of the obtained data suggests that actin polymerization is essential in order for the sperm to complete activation induced by the exposure to ZP with release of the acrosomal content. The measurement of intracellular Ca for single cells exposed to solubilized ZP did not show any significant differences in the kinetics of Ca signalling, or in the concentration achieved by sperm treated with cyto D, with respect to controls. In both groups, intracellular Ca levels peaked 20-30 s after ZP exposition, and gradually decreased to reach the basal concentration after 800 s.

Nevertheless, by blocking actin filament formation, some modifications that take place during the process of capacitation can be prevented. Sperm treated with cyto D, even if they are able to gain the capacitated pattern with CTC, are not able to complete the process through the exocytosis of the acrosomal content after exposure to ZP. It can be supposed that the lack of PLCc 1 expression at the equatorial level, as revealed by immunohistochemistry, could be responsible for this inability to undergo AR. This de-localization of the enzyme could cause an absent or limited release of intracellular Ca in specific subdomains, which may be pivotal for fusion of the plasma with the outer acrosomal membrane (Spungin et al., 1995) . This was impossible to ascertain by evaluation of the whole calcium response of sperm as in our study. Experiments are in progress in order to verify both the changes of localized Ca fluxes in distinct regions of the sperm head and the co-localization of PLCc 1 with actin filaments. These investigations could lead to a better understanding of the correlation between the actin polymerization status and the late events of the acrosome reaction, which take place after the engagement of sperm ZP receptors.",

(1985) classified the endometria of non-pregnant cows into four categories and showed how, as the grade of severity of endometrial damage increases, the number of mast cells, which are considered fundamental in beginning and propagating the inflammatory process, increased notably. The correlation between endometrial mast cells and the quantity of some inflammatory mediators was studied by Belluzzi et al. (1994) who found a close correlation between the elevated values of leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4 ) and the granulocytic tissue infiltrate. No correlation was found for mast cells. The difference in the average values of LTB 4 and thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2 ) found in the endometria of cows having clinically evident endometritis and in healthy cows having normal reproductive activity was statistically significant for both mediators. A precise evaluation of the distribution of mast cells in the endometria of cows was carried out by Galeotti et al. (1997) , leukotriene C 4 and interleukin-6 (IL-6), all of which are inflammatory mediators potentially released by mast cells.",

This result could be a cause of disagreement regarding the representativeness of a single biopsy. The count of mast cells carried out using toluidine blue stain permitted us to confirm that the values found in the endometria deemed healthy are in agreement with the normal value defined by Galeotti et al. (1997) . The differences between the average values of mast cells present in healthy endometria with respect to the pathological ones are not significant however, nor are the differences in average concentrations of the two mediators in the two categories. However, a slight increase of LTC 4 in uteri with endometritis was observed, a category where the average count of mast cells was higher. The distribution of mast cells in the uterus does not seem to have distinctive characteristics in the five sites examined, since only the differences between the average values of the mast cells in the body with respect to the apex of the right horn were significant. This result is difficult to interpret and could be correlated with the number of pregnancies sustained by the horn and/or the site of the most recent pregnancy. Our research did not show any significant relationship between the number of mast cells present at the base of the horn and the value of the eicosanoids LTB 4 and LTC 4 obtained from bioptic sample at the same site. We need to consider that the staining using toluidine blue carried out by us shows only nondegranulated mast cells and therefore does not give an indication of the relationship between degranulated and non-degranulated mast cells in the optic field under examination. Other staining techniques (K\u00fc ther et al., 1998) showed mast cells which do not coincide with those shown by toluidine blue in bovine endometria populations and, therefore, the technique used to visualize the mast cells can condition the result. A second consideration regards the mediators investigated in this study, that is LTB 4 , LTC 4",

The test results of the dosage of IL-6 suggest that the human monoclonal kit does not have a cross-reaction with bovine endometrial tissue. In conclusion, this study did not show any strict correlation between the inflammatory mediators examined and the mast cells highlighted with toluidine blue. Histochemical and immunohistochemical staining could furnish more reliable data on the number of mast cells present in the endometrium. The possibility that the mediators investigated and correlated with the 168 mast cells are also released by other cells constituting the endometrial infiltrate suggests that we turn our attention to substances which are more specifically attributable to mast cells, such as histamine, tryptase and chymase.",

            "text": "The difficulties in the prediction of ovulation time in the mare, together with the increasing use of cooled and frozen semen for artificial insemination, have stimulated investigators to search for methods for induction of ovulation. These methods are essentially based on exogenous administration of one of three hormones directly or indirectly involved in the mechanism of ovulation: hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin), CEG (Crude Equine Gonadotrophin) (Duchamp et al., 1987) , or GnRH (Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone). Repeated administration of hCG, which is a heterologous glycoprotein for mares, may stimulate an immune response able to neutralise the effect of the hormone (Roser et al., 1979) . Although CEG has not shown this negative side effect, it is not found on the market, and purified extracts are produced and utilised only by few research groups. GnRH, physiologically released in a pulsatile manner, and its analogues have been tested for induction of ovulation in oestrous mares either by repeated injections at given time intervals (Palmer and Quellier, 1988) or as slow-release subcutaneous implants. For this purpose, a slowrelease subcutaneous implant containing the synthetic GnRH analogue deslorelin acetate (OvuplantA) is successfully used in United States and Australia (Meinert et al., 1993; Meyers et al., 1997) . The response to OvuplantA administration was similar to that obtained using hCG. However, this formulation is currently not available in the Italian and European market. The efficacy of buserelin, a GnRH analogue also commercialised in Italy, has been recently investigated for induction of ovulation in the mare. The administration of a single dose has not yielded encouraging results (Vidament et al., 1992) . On the other hand, Battut et al. (2001) observed that most mares treated twice daily with intravenous (IV) administration of 20 or 40 mg of buserelin ovulated within 48 h. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of repeated administration of 40 mg buserelin for induction of ovulation in the mare, as compared to a single administration of 2500 IU hCG or a placebo. 170 ",

(1988) showed a mean time from the beginning of twice daily administration of 40 mg buserelin and ovulation of 45.6\u00b115.2 h, much shorter than the 74.9\u00b141.9 h found in our study.

The aim, when inducing ovulation in mares, is not so much to hasten it, but to ensure that it occurs in a short and predictable time interval, in order to plan when the mare should be artificially inseminated. Contrary to what has been described in the literature, in our study treatment with buserelin did not seem to fulfil these criteria, as it was not able to induce ovulation in the mare in a repeatable and predictable way.",

In fact, the possibility of restoring fertility and achieving pregnancy after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian cortical strips has been reported for large mammals (Gosden et al., 1994) , rodents (Cox et al., 1996) and recently for humans (Oktay, 2001) . In effect, primary/secondary follicles survive cryopreservation and grafting procedures in a large number, and can undergo subsequent development. However, the applicability of this procedure is affected by two main problems: firstly, the chemical and physical damage induced by the cryopreservation protocol, which results in a dramatic loss of potentially developing follicles; secondly, reimplantation of a stored ovarian cortex after chemotherapy does not exclude an eventual cancer relapse. Thus, an alternative option to preserve fertility relies on the possibility of obtaining mature oocytes from in vitro cultured small follicles isolated from frozen/thawed tissue. Also in this case it is necessary to develop cryopreservation protocols able to preserve follicle functionality and to identify culture conditions capable of successfully supporting full follicle development. The aim of our study was to compare the in vitro development of intact sheep preantral follicles isolated from cryopreserved ovarian cortical strips stored with two widely used CPAs, DMSO and EG.",

The ovaries were cut with surgical blades into fragments of about 0.5\u00d70.5 cm that were 174 used to isolate unfrozen preantral follicles or to cryopreserve ovarian strips. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethylene glycol (EG) were used at the final concentration of 1.5 M in M2 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, antibiotics (75 mg/l penicillin-G, 50 mg/l streptomycin sulfate) and 0.1 M sucrose. Ovarian pieces were firstly aspirated into plastic insemination straws (IMV, France), kept on ice for 15 min and transferred to a programmable freezer (Cryo-Logic, IVM, France). The straws were cryopreserved according to a slow cooling protocol developed by Gosden et al. (1994) then plunged into liquid nitrogen and stored for up to 3 months. Thawing was carried out by rapidly warming the straws to 38\u00b0C. Dilution of the cryoprotectants was performed at room temperature with HEPES-buffered TCM199 supplemented with decreasing concentrations of DMSO or EG and 0.1 M sucrose (3 steps, 15 min). Preantral follicles were mechanically isolated from either frozen or fresh ovary fragments in Hepes-buffered TCM199. Preantral follicles were then measured, and selected follicles of a mean diameter of 170\u00b120 mm were individually transferred to 96-V-well microtiter plates and cultured in 25 ml of a-MEM supplemented with 2% FCS, 1% ITS, antibiotics and 1 mg/ml ovine FSH (oFSH). Culture was carried out for 10 days at 38\u00b0C in a O 2 5%, CO 2 5%, N 2 90% gas mixture (Cecconi et al., 1999) . Culture media were changed daily and 15 ml of recovered conditioned media was stored at -80\u00b0C for estradiol determination. At the end of culture follicles were analysed to record: 1) diameter; 2) percentage of differentiated antral-like cavities; 3) morphological aspect (by histological analysis) and 4) estradiol production. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were isolated from in vitro growth antral follicles and analysed to record: 1) percentage of isolated healthy oocytes presenting a surrounding layer of cumulus cells and 2) the metabolic coupling between germinal and somatic compartment (by evaluation of the 3H-uridine uptake).",

The majority (94%; n=33) of preantral follicles isolated from the fresh cortex showed the presence of oocytes with agranular cytoplasm and a central GV, surrounded by several layers of granulosa cells and a well organized theca layer. In contrast, 50% of EG (n=15) and 34% of DMSO (n=15; EG vs. DMSO: p<0.01) cryopreserved follicles revealed a damaged structure, frequently characterized by loss of intercellular communication between the oocyte and the surrounding granulosa cells, and signs of pyknosis in the GV as well as in some granulosa cells. Regarding growth, freshly isolated and frozen preantral follicles grew from a mean diameter of about 170 mm to a final diameter of approximately 300-310 mm after 10 days of culture, without significant differences between the experimental groups tested. A translucent antrallike cavity was recognizable starting from day 6 and, by the end of culture, the percentage of follicles forming antral-like cavities was similar for fresh and frozen follicles. This result was confirmed by histological analysis, which evidenced a similar morphological aspect between IVG antral follicles derived from fresh or cryopreserved tissue. Fresh follicles released increasing amounts of E 2 with a sharp rise from day 6 to day 10 (p<0.01). A similar final level of this steroid was found for EG cryopreserved follicles, although lower than for the group control, up to day 6 (p<0.05). E 2 production by DMSO treated follicles was comparable to that of those treated with EG up to day 6, but from that day onwards it remained significantly lower as compared with fresh and EG groups (p<0.01).",

            "text": "In this study we demonstrated that cryopreservation of sheep cortical tissue allows the recovery of viable preantral follicles, which can be grown in vitro with differing efficiency depending on the cryoprotective agent employed. Our results confirm previous observations indicating that the freezing/thawing process severely damages preantral follicles, which are considered less resistant than primordial ones to the injuries caused by cryopreservation (Gosden et al., 2002) . The increased complexity of the growing follicles makes them more sensitive to cryodamage. It is well known that the physiological differentiation of ovarian follicles in mammalia is strictly dependent on the existence of a bi-directional regulative dialogue between the germinal and somatic compartments, exerted through the production of paracrine/autocrine factors, or through the presence of functional gap junctions (Cecconi, 2002) . From our results, evaluation of the post-thaw viability of the follicles using morphological analysis shows that cryopreservation can cause disruption of gap junctional communication, thus impairing follicle survival. The extent of such damage is dependent on the cryoprotectant used, as demonstrated by the finding that the percentage of healthy follicles is higher in EG than DMSO. Our results also demonstrated that the in vitro culture of sheep preantral follicles is a useful test for evaluating the damage induced by CPA and/or freezing procedures, as previously proposed for the mouse (Newton et al., 2001) and the sheep (Amorin et al., 2003) . However, a comprehensive evaluation of cryodamage cannot be exclusively based upon morphological analysis but also needs to be assessed by more detailed biochemical investigations. (Platt, 2002) . The first electromyographic studies were performed by Adrian and Bronk in 1929 , by means of a specially manufactured electrode called concentric needle. In this method the electromyographers assess the traces empirically, by viewing them on an oscilloscope screen and by listening to their sound on an audio monitor, providing a semiquantitative evaluation of the muscle activity (Adrian and Bronk, 1929) . Recently, Wijnberg et al. (2002) performed, in horses, an offline analysis of the MUPs in a semiautomatic way. This method, where the MUPs were not automatically selected and were manually analyzed, is quite reliable and easy to use. However, to observe the results in real time, we used a multi-MUP EMG analysis, based on a ''turns'' analysis described by Willison (1964) and refined by Stalberg et al. (1995) . The main advantages of this method are that it is an online method, which permits an automatic expression of more than one MUP, it is fast enough for routine use, it does not require special electrodes and it is reproducible. The aim of our study was to create a normative database that can be used for electromyographic evaluation of muscular function in clinical studies and to compare the MUP parameters between the two groups of animals which are characterized by a different muscular mass.",

The EMG examination was performed by inserting a disposable concentric needle electrode into the muscle, advancing or withdrawing it in small steps and maintaining it in each new position with a firm grip, to sample different areas of the muscle. The EMG examination was performed in splenius, trapezius, and triceps muscles. Each muscle was evaluated at rest and during different degrees of muscle contraction. The software proposes a grouping of the MUPs, and many different MUPs were usually obtained from each recording site. First of all, the MUPs were divided into monophasic and polyphasic, according to the number of phases, and thus, for each subset of MUPs, the program analysed duration, amplitude, area/amplitude ratio and firing rate. All values are expressed as mean -standard deviation (s.d.). The statistical significance of differences between the two sets of data was assessed using the two tailed t-test for unpaired data.

Thus, a stud dog can be excluded as father of a litter when the puppies present one allele which could not have been inherited either from the bitch or the same stud dog. In the parentage testing presented, only putative sire no. 1 had full allele compatibility with all puppies. The visualisation of PCR products using polyacrylamide gel can reveal, with some limitations, allele polymorphisms able to solve doubtful paternity cases. Nevertheless, in canine forensic medicine the case to solve often concerns possible mixed paternity, which means that puppies of the same litter may have been fathered by different sires (i.e. superfecundation). On this basis, the technology applied in this study allowed us to partially assign the paternity, leaving it unsolved for two of the five puppies. This may be explained by two considerations: the absence of literature data about microsatellite polymorphism in boxer dogs may have caused the poor choice of markers for solving parentage in this breed; moreover, the visualisation technology applied only allows us to distinguish alleles that differ greatly in size, at the same time reducing the potential information content of each microsatellite.",

Mice deficient in neurotrophins or those having non-functional neurotrophin receptors have added substantial information to the knowledge of the role of neurotrophins in nervous system development (Fari\u00f1 as, 1999) . However, the non-neuronal phenotype of these mouse strains has only been poorly analyzed, and remains basically unknown. Regarding TrkA deficient mice, we have demonstrated in this study that the lack of this protein provokes an altered organogenesis of the murine thymus. The thymus of TrkA knock-out mice showed the presence of cysts of different sizes lined by a single line of cells, cilia and mucous cells, probably due to the absence of trka functional genes. The mechanism through which the TrkA receptor could act on the development of thymic epithelial cells remains unclear. Regarding TrkB, the present study demonstrates that the thymus of mice lacking functional TrkB develops thymic alterations, at least in the cell population that normally expresses this receptor. The homozygous mice carrying a mutation in the trkb gene resulting in a non functional TrkB protein, showed structural and ultrastructural changes mainly consisting of massive cell death of T-lymphocytes for apoptosis. These data suggest that TrkB is involved in the prevention of the death of cortical lymphocytes. Our results are in agreement with previous data reported by Maroder et al. (1996) , who observed that BDNF prevented cell death of immature thymocytes. Taken together, these results lend support to the idea that in the mammalian thymus both the NGF/TrkA and the BDNF/TrkB systems play important roles in the development and maintenance of epithelial cells and thymocytes, respectively, and that both ligand-receptor complexes are involved in the intercellular communication between these two main cell types of the thymus. This study on transgenic mice greatly contributes to the understanding of the possible role of neurotrophins in the immune system and the importance of these growth factors in health and disease.",

This kind of treatment, which is authorised in many countries, has been definitively banned by the E.U. because of its potential hazard to animal health (Kronfeld, 2001; Macr\u00ec, 1999) . There are currently no analytical methods able to reveal rBST administration. However, there are circulating molecules which can be considered as analytical targets and indirect indicators for the abovementioned treatment of bovines, since their concentration is proportional to the stimulative action of ST. The most famous of these is Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), a hormone mainly secreted by the liver (Prosser et al., 1989 ) that mediates the biological action of ST on several tissues. Almost all seric IGF-1 circulates bound to specific IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs); for this reason the current analytical methods used to measure it are still imprecise (Breier et al., 1991; Twigg et al., 2000) .",

Specifically comparing the reactivity of the whole sera on the two types of BST, we observed a positive reaction for both of them in eight out of the ten analyzed mice. The fact that some mice did not produce an appreciable immune response against the BST N-terminal portion could be explained by considering the remarkable similarity 195 Figure 1 .

Apoptosis can be detected in numerous areas of the central nervous system (CNS) under normal conditions but also in several neurodegenerative diseases. In the postnatal cerebellum (Lossi et al., 2002) apoptosis affects mainly pre-migratory granule cells (CGCs), their precursors within the external granular layer (EGL), and post-mitotic, post-migratory CGCs within the internal granular layer (IGL). Apoptosis is characterized morphologically by a series of nuclear alterations including fragmentation and chromatin condensation eventually leading to the appearance of the so called apoptotic bodies, consisting of highly condensed cellular and nuclear fragments. Numerous proteins are involved in the execution of apoptosis, among which caspases play a pivotal role (Allsopp et al., 2000) . Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors that are activated following proteolysis. In CGCs, caspase 3 is activated at the endpoint of a cascade of events which affects other members of this protein family. The main substrate of active caspase 3 is poly-ADP-ribosepolymerase-1 (PARP-1 - Fig. 1A) , a protein normally involved in genomic surveillance and DNA reparation (Smith, 2001) . Following caspase 3 cleavage, a 85 kD fragment (p85) is generated that is known to be responsible for at least some of the morphological changes of apoptosis.",

This is 208 mainly due to epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, and was found to be differentiated between maternal and paternal pronuclei. The analysis at a global level of DNA methylation, first carried out in zygotes produced in vivo, has in fact demonstrated that the male genome is characterized by a lower level of DNA methylation as compared to the female one. Moreover, the observation that the paternal pronucleus was also characterized by a higher level of histone acetylation in most of the zygotes analysed seems to indicate an early transcription of the male chromatin component. The same analysis of DNA methylation and histone acetylation subsequently carried out in pig zygotes obtained from oocytes matured and fertilized in vitro, demonstrated that the ability to correctly remodel the sperm chromatin is markedly reduced when compared to that of zygotes obtained in vivo. This demonstrated that the process of oocyte maturation is crucial for the oocyte to develop the mechanisms necessary for complete chromatin rearrangement. In fact, when the process of maturation doesn't occur under physiological conditions, such as in the case of maturation in vitro, this results in a reduced ability to correctly remodel the paternal genome that may compromise the success of embryo development.",

These data, that indicate a protective mechanism exerted by CO on respiratory mechanics, are corroborated by the EVLW changes. Our results showed that, in animals treated with CO, the volume of extravascular lung water significantly decreased, particularly in the early phase of endotoxic shock. The plasma levels of VEGF in animals treated only with LPS were 416\u00b1120 pg/ml, and those in animals pre-treated with carbon monoxide were between 0 and 15 pg/ml, confirming the hypothesis of a protective mechanism CO-induced on the altered capillary permeability due to LPS (Karmpaliotis et al., 2002) . In our experimental model, the expression of HO-1 in cardiac and lung tissues was not modified, confirming that activation of HO-1 requires a longer experimental period, as demonstrated in a previous ''in vitro'' study. Therefore, the results that we obtained in our hyper-acute model of endotoxic shock are due to inhaled CO, without any interference from neo-synthesized molecules in the tissue.",

This molecule possesses a unique serine residue at the third position (Ser3) that is modified by n-octanoid acid. Acylation is essential for ligand binding to the receptor GHS-R and subsequent ghrelin activity. In mammals ghrelin is expressed in a restricted hypothalamic area, the arcuate nucleus (Lu et al., 2002) . This indicates that ghrelin may play a role in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy metabolism in the central nervous system (Date et al., 2000) . Ghrelin is widely expressed in a variety of peripheral tissues, i.e. the stomach, intestine, placenta, kidney and pancreas (Kojima et al., 1999; Date et al., 2000; Mori et al., 2000; Dornonville de la Cour et al., 2001; Gualillo et al., 2001) . Although little is known about ghrelin in non-mammalian vertebrates, ghrelin has been identified in the brain and stomach of a frog (Rana esculenta), showing the same acylation at the third aminoacidic residue as for mammals (Galas et al., 2002) . Recently, Kaya et al. (2002) purified chicken ghrelin from the stomach of a chicken (Gallus gallus) and characterized its structure. Chicken ghrelin consists of 26 amino acids showing acylation at Ser3 and the same sequence in the N-terminal region as for ghrelin from humans and rats. In the present study we have used antisera against rat ghrelin to investigate the distribution of ghrelin-like peptide in the gastroenteric system of the chicken.",

Cytokines are able to activate other cellules like those of hypothalamus, liver, reproductive organs etc. (Elsasser et al., 1997) . As previously stressed (Bertoni et al., 2000; Trevisi et al., 2002) , the consequent endocrine-metabolic changes can cause marked negative effects: anorexia, lipomobilization, reduction of milk yield and reproductive traits. Therefore, the modulation of cytokine release and/or the inhibition of some related effects could represent a noticeable target in the transition period. The aim of our study concerned the evaluation of the effects of a preventive administration of a well-known anti-inflammatory drug (acetyl-salicylate, able to inhibit both cyclooxygenases -COX-1 and COX-2 -the key enzymes of inflammatory response) in post-calving dairy cows.",

The positive effects of LAS treatments could also be seen in the quicker increase of DMI that was suggested by the lower frequency of anorexia and the similar levels of bOHB, despite a more pronounced energy deficiency (confirmed by the more marked reduction of BCS). Moreover, the higher DMI of LAS also seems supported by the higher plasma urea level, mainly related to the total protein intake when diet composition is unchanged. The better health status (i.e. more favourable indices of inflammation) and perhaps the higher feed intake of LAS allowed a prompt recovery of common metabolic conditions, a better liver activity, a rise in milk yield and an improvement in fertility. In conclusion, the use of molecules able to modulate the eicosanoids after calving seems promising, but further research is required.",

After lambing, due to complications, two sheep from group A and three from group B were eliminated. The male/female ratio between lambs born was 54:46 in group A and 50:50 in group B. The lambs were weighed at birth and at sale (30 days old) in order to calculate their weight gain during suckling. With such measurements we were able to estimate the average amount of milk intake from lambs during suckling using the equation developed by Poujardieu (1969) . All the results obtained were processed 223 using the GLM procedure of SAS (2000) following the model: y ijk =m+ a i +a j +ab ij +e ijk , where y ijk is the single observation, a i is the diet effect (i=1, 2), a j =is the sex effect ( j=male or female), ab ij is the interaction between diet and sex, and e ijk is the error. Table II shows the results relative to: weight at birth and at sale, weight gain (WG) and the milk consumed by lambs (MC) according to mothers' diet and sex. The different NSC content of the diets induced statistically significant differences (p<0.05) only for weight at sale. Interestingly, WG and MC were higher for the group that received the diet with the highest nutritive value. The results, in agreement with those of Cannas (2001) , could be due to the high level of somatotrope hormone (SH) present in the blood during the first period of lactation: this would also direct energy use (and hence NSC use) towards milk production instead of the deposition of body fat (Peel et al., 1987) . Regarding the differences between the sexes, the males showed higher values ( p<0.01) for all the examined parameters. Diet\u00d7sex interaction was never found to be statistically significant.",

However, high dietary lipid content modifies whole body chemical composition, resulting in a higher adipogenetic deposition which influences the organoleptic quality of fish products (Segato et al., 2003a) . This influence on quality can be assessed by sensory analyses such as a discriminative taste panel. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensory quality of fish in relation to dietary fat content on organoleptic parameters of European sea bass reared in mariculture.",

During summer and autumn of 2001 (97 experimental days) fish were fed (1% BW) two isoproteic diets with different crude fat level (Low vs. High). Proximate composition (AOAC, 2000) and gross energy of the two experimental diets are reported in Table I . At the end of the trial, 30 fish (final body weight: 412\u00b126 vs 407\u00b122 g) from each experimental group were caught and killed on ice. After 48 h conservation at 2\u00b11\u00b0C, discriminative sensory analysis was carried out on fish (n=8) by 10 trained tasters. Gutted trunks were wrapped in tinfoil and cooked in an electric oven at 165\u00b0C until the fillet core temperature reached 60\u00b0C. Jury evaluation considered the following attributes: trunk compactness, exudation and skin detachment; fillet (white epiaxial muscle) odour, lightness, tenderness, juiciness, marine and salty flavour and taste. The score was expressed on a 9-point scale (1=low ... 9=high) using the attributes schedule in Table II . For tasting each judge considered the same dorsal muscular portion, avoiding intermuscular adipose deposits. Data were submitted to one-way ANOVA according to a mono-experimental design (diet effect) by PROC GLM of SAS (1999) .",

            "text": "Trunk compactness and significant visible exudation were lower for fish fed with the High diet (Table II) . This result is probably due to the higher fillet fat content observed in High diet fed fish (7.7% vs. 8.9%; p<0.1 -data not tabulated). The fillet structure is influenced by intra-and perimuscular fat content and its location which modify texture and water hold capacity (Torrissen et al., 2001) . The higher exudative quantity observed in the fish fed the Low diet trunk was probably due to moisture losses caused by more intensive protein denaturation during heating treatment. On the contrary, fish fed the higher fat content diet showed higher values of fillet juiciness and tenderness. These quality traits also are dependent on the higher level of muscular fat. With regard to juiciness, suitable marbling limits cellular liquid losses during heating and induces chewing salivation. Lipids also limit the cohesion between muscular fibres and between muscular and collagen fibres, reducing firmness of the cooked flesh (Segato et al., 2003b; Torrissen, ibidem) . Data of sensory tenderness were confirmed by maximum shear force determination (7.8 vs. 6.0 N; p<005 -data not tabulated). Panellists did not detect any differences in fillet lightness while instrumental measurements using the Hunter-L*a*b* method showed significant differences (L*:77.6 vs. 81.4; p<0.01 -data not tabulated). Some sensory parameters (i.e. colour) showed thresholds which are not perceptible even by trained panellists. Organoleptic traits such as odour, flavour and taste were not influenced by diet any factors.",

Being ubiquitous, these moulds can easily contaminate foodstuffs. O.A is predominantly found in cereal grains, cereal products, legumes, oilseed, coffee beans and feed. Moreover, O.A has been identified in the tissue and organs of animals (pigs, chicken) fed contaminated feed. The presence of O.A has also been reported in human milk. The IARC (International Agency for Research in Cancer) has classified O.A as Group 2B, a possible human carcinogen (IARC, 1993) . In several areas of Eastern Europe, where chronic exposure to O.A occurs, involvement of this mycotoxin in the cancer aetiology of the urinary system, and in kidney pathologies typical of Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN) has been suspected. Studies into the correlation between O.A and BEN (Puntaric et al., 2001) have shown higher O.A contamination levels in cereals from endemic areas with respect to cereals from non-endemic areas. The high risk for Public Health represented by such a mycotoxin and the insufficient epidemiological data relevant to Italian regions, which neighbour the Balkan area, suggested to us the present survey aimed at evaluation of overall status of O.A contamination levels in some cereals produced in Puglia and Basilicata, which are regions where the economy is primarily based on agriculture.",

In fact, collection of oocytes by means of ultrasound guided follicular aspiration is routinely performed with success in large prepubescent and adult ruminant species . In the buffalo species, because of their low response to superovulation treatments (Karaivanov, 1986) , OPU technology, together with an improvement in the multistep process of in vitro embryo production, seems to be the best way to enhance genetic progression through the maternal lineage Neglia et al., 2003) . However, in vitro embryo production in buffalo has always been associated with a lower efficiency as compared to the bovine (Totey et al., 1992) , although recently some encouraging results have been reported both from slaughterhouse recovered oocytes (Gasparrini et al., 2000) , and from OPUderived oocytes (Neglia et al., 2003) . Obviously, in order to optimize the procedure, an efficient method for embryo freezing should be developed. In fact, until now the only pregnancies recorded for the buffalo species were obtained from the transfer of fresh embryos produced in vitro. In 1991 Madan et al. (Madan et al., 1991) reported the birth of the first buffalo calf after the transfer of a fresh blastocyst obtained through in vitro maturation (IVM), in vitro fertilization (IVF) and in co-culture with oviductal cells (IVC). Four other calves were produced in India in 1994, by transfer of fresh blastocysts obtained in vitro (Madan et al., 1994) , using the same method. In 1997, Boni et al. (Boni et al., 1997) , reported two pregnancies obtained from the transfer of two fresh morulae, produced after OPU/IVEP procedures. Only three calves have been produced from frozen blastocysts (Galli et al., 1998) ; in this case zygotes (2 days after IVF) were transferred into ligated sheep oviduct before freezing. The possibility of cryopreserving buffalo embryos by vitrification with good efficiency in terms of in vitro survival rate, has recently been reported (Neglia et al., 2001) . On the basis of these results a one month trial was carried out on a buffalo farm in order to verify the efficiency of this freezing method, by transferring vitrified and fresh embryos produced using OPU-IVEP technology.",

            "text": "In March 2002 12 lactating pluriparous buffalo cows underwent repeated transvaginal follicular aspiration twice-weekly for seven sessions. OPU was carried out by using a portable ultrasound unit (Aloka SSD-500) with a 5 MHz sector scanner and a metal guide to fit 17 gauge needles both allocated in a properly designed vaginal guide. A vacuum pressure of -40 mm Hg was constantly maintained and all visible antral follicles were punctured. The Cumulus Oocyte Complexes (COCs) were searched immediately after filtering the aspirated follicular fluid and aspiration medium and classified under 5 categories (A, B, C, D, E), according to a standard classification (Neglia et al., 2003) . COCs were placed in 25 mM hepes buffered TCM 199 supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml FSH, 5 mg/ml LH, 1 mg/ml estradiol and 50 mM cysteamine (Gasparrini et al., 2000) in a portable incubator at 38.5\u00b0C and moved to the lab within 4 to 6 h. In the laboratory COCs were transferred into 50 ml droplets of a final maturation medium consisting of bicarbonate-buffered TCM 199 (B 199) with hormones and cysteamine in the same concentration previously described under medical oil. The droplets were incubated at 38.5\u00b0C for 22-24 h under a controlled gas atmosphere consisting of 5% CO 2 in humidified air. The day after IVM the oocytes were in vitro fertilized in 50 ml droplets of Fert-TALP, supplemented with 0.2 mM/ml penicillamine, 0.1 mM/ml hypotaurine and 0.01 mM/ml heparin. Sperm was treated using the swim-up procedure in a modified version of Ham's medium and resuspended in a final concentration of 2\u00d7106/ml. Fertilizing droplets were then incubated under the same gas atmosphere as for in vitro maturation. After 20-22 h presumptive zygotes were cultured in 20 ml droplets of SOFaaBSA in a modulation chamber with a gas atmosphere of 5% CO 2 , 7% O 2 and 88% N 2 . On day 5 (day 0=IVF day) the cleavage rate was assessed and embryos were transferred into fresh droplets of the same medium for two further days of culture. Final embryo output (morulae +blastocysts) was evaluated on day 7 of culture. Some embryos were transferred fresh into opportunely synchronized buffalo heifers, by using a double injection of PGF 2a 12 days apart. Other embryos were vitrified using a method previously described (Neglia et al., 2001) and transferred after warming. Confirmation of pregnancy was obtained by rectal palpation of the genital apparatus at 45 and 120 days (after embryo transfer).",

In this way the sheep represents a temporary host, in which embryos can develop until day 7: this step improves the quality of the embryo, which grows under ''normal'' conditions and is more resistant to the cryopreservation process. In the buffalo species, the entire in vitro embryo production system has been developed by extrapolating information acquired in more studied species (cattle and sheep): for this reason the embryo nutritional requirements are unknown. Further studies are therefore necessary in order to optimize the in vitro development conditions of buffalo embryos. We underline the lack of pregnancies established by fresh embryos: this surprising finding may be explained by the higher sensitivity of buffalo embryos to environmental stress as compared with bovine (Neglia et al., 2003) . However, the results obtained in this trial, demonstrate the possibility of using vitrified embryos produced in vitro in order to produce buffalo calves. This may in turn allow the application of OPU/IVEP technology to accelerate genetic progression through maternal lineage.",

Evolution of the rigor index showed different behaviour between the two groups, with the trout fed the PP diet already showing a value of nearly 100% at 2 h after death, while the FM trout attained the whole rigor 3 h later (Table I) . The observed behaviour is consistent with the AEC value (significantly lower in PP trout at 2 h after death) and with the evolution of fillet shrinkage. In fact, although the values obtained at 24 h for the fillet shrinkage were similar for the two groups, this parameter showed a more gradual behaviour in trout fed the FM diet. No differences were observed for the pH values, either in the eye liquor or in the epaxial muscle, or for the dielectric properties. As regards the colour, the site of measurement strongly ( p<0.01) affected all parameters. The lightness was modified during the 24 h, with higher values at the start and at the end of the evaluation period, but did not reveal any differences due to diet.

The T2 groups presented higher values for all the classes of immunoglobulins as compared to the control group in agreement with the results reported by Sugano et al. (1998) . Rooke et al.

Correlations between genetic variants and milk yield have not yet been observed for the buffalo species, but the possibility that one animal shows similar milk yield values in successive lactations, may be indicative of the utility of selecting for that characteristic. Currently, PKM supplies information on the quantity of mozzarella cheese produced/lactation, but this does not take into account the milk's cheese-making properties. Therefore, we thought it worthwhile to investigate the repeatability of the ''milk yield'' character and the possibility of classifying subjects into the categories of ''high'' or ''low'' milk yield. This may avoid monthly controls during lactation, because, in the case of a positive result, this character could be included in the selection programs for the species, whose milk is only used for cheese-making.",

The VTEC serotype O157 is most frequently reported in many countries and is frequently isolated from cattle and sheep, although other serotypes have been isolated from human cases. Human infection can also cause non-bloody diarrhea or result in no symptoms. Incidence of infection has presented a seasonal trend in many countries, with the summer months presenting higher prevalence of infection in both animals and humans. Many cases of infection have been reported in European and non-European countries and up to now 245 cases of VTEC infection have been reported to Enter-net Italia surveillance system. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the application of an official method for detecting typical (sorbitol-negative, glucuronidase negative) viable Escherichia coli O157 in food to microbial testing of beef carcasses and faecal samples at slaughterhouse. In detail, immuno-complexes were spread over one half of the plate with a sterile swab and were diluted further by streaking with a loop on the remaining two unstreaked quadrants. All isolated colonies with typical morphology were tested for ability to produce indole (ISO 7251:1993, 5.5 and 9.2.5-8; 9.2 .6 modified about incubation temperature: 37\u00b0C instead of 45\u00b0C), fermenting cellobiose and O157 antigen using latex agglutination kit (Dry Spot E. coli O157, Oxoid, S.p.A., Garbagnate Milanese, Italia). Typical colonies (i.e. indole positive, cellobiose negative and positive to latex agglutination test) were further tested using the API 20E kit (BioM\u00e9rieux Italia, Roma).

The increasing demand for transparency in the food industry derives either from socio-religious or economic reasons and has provoked a strong demand for appropriate detection methods that allow identification of the different components in processed food. The conventional methodologies used for the determination of species origin in food products are mainly based on immunochemical and electrophoretic analysis of proteins and on liquid chromatography techniques. However, immunological and electrophoretic methods cannot distinguish between closely related species and are often not suitable for food products with complex matrixes. Chromatographic techniques allow detection of differences in the percentages of fatty acids but are rather laborious. Recently, DNA-based techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or DNA hybridisation have been applied to identify meat species. These methods are sensitive and can still be used if the meat has been cured or autoclaved. Therefore, the aim of this study was either to optimise the extraction procedure of genomic DNA or to evaluate the suitability of a PCR method employing mitochondrial primers in detecting the authenticity of processed meat products.",

Once the fish did not show any more vital behaviour, a blood sample was collected from the heart using a sterile syringe, after disinfection of the skin, and inoculated into three different blood-culture systems: Signal Blood Culture System (SBCS, OXOID); H\u00e9moline Performance Ana\u00e9robie (BIOM\u00c9 RIEUX); IsolatorTM 1.5 (OXOID); and into tubes of Salt Polimixin Broth (SPB, OXOID). SBCS blood-cultures were pre-incubated at 36\u00b0C for 1 h and then at 36\u00b0C for 24 h in a thermostatic agitator. The blood-cultures showing growth were streaked onto plates of 3 different media: i) MacConkey agar (OXOID) plates which were incubated at 35\u00b0C for 24 h; ii) Pseudomonas agar base (OXOID plus Pseudomonas CFC Supplement) plates which were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 24 h; iii) Sulphite Polimixin Sulphadiazine agar (SPS, OXOID) plates which were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h using anaerobic jars with a Gas Generating Kit (bioMerieux). The same media were used for the IsolatorTM 1.5 blood-culture system, while the H\u00e9moline Performance Ana\u00e9robie blood-cultures were only streaked onto SPS agar plates, incubated as indicated above. SPB enrichments were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 24 h and streaked onto Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salts Sucrose (TCBS) agar (OXOID) plates, then incubated at 30\u00b0C for 24 h. A muscle sample was also aseptically drawn from each fish and divided into three sub-samples which were homogenised (1:9), respectively, with Peptone Buffered Water (PBW, OXOID), Reinforced Clostridium Medium (RCM, OXOID) and Salt Polimixin Broth (SPB, OXOID). PBW enrichments were streaked onto MacConkey agar (OXOID) plates which were incubated at 35\u00b0C for 24 h and onto Pseudomonas agar base (OXOID, plus Pseudomonas CFC Supplement) plates which were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 24 h. RCM enrichments were streaked onto SPS (OXOID) plates incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h using anaerobic jars with a Gas Generating Kit (BIOMERIEUX). SPB enrichments were streaked onto TCBS agar (OXOID) plates, incubated at 30\u00b0C for 24 h. After incubation all morphologically distinct colonies were picked, purified by restreaking onto tubes of Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) (Oxoid), and identified using common bacteriological techniques and the Api 20E and API 20A systems (bioMerieux). Each sample was also subjected to necroscopy and a sterile swab was rubbed over each phlogistic focus and streaked directly onto plates of TCBS agar (OXOID) and Aeromonas agar (OXOID), which were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 24 h, as well as onto plates of Chromocult Coliform agar, which were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h.

Previously more attention was directed towards the detection of bacteria or parasites; however, the importance of viral infections is still underestimated by routine surveillance (Sair et al., 2001) . Some types of food, such as shellfish, seem to play a major role in viral outbreaks, due to their high capacity of water filtration. Viruses are able to persist in mussels for a long period, even after their immersion in cleaned stalling water, and it has been demonstrated that they can survive decontamination processes used for bacterial agents (Richards et al., 1998) . Italian law by decree no. 530 of 12/30/1999, regarding the sanitary rules for the trade of living mussels, does not provide for control of the absence of viral particles as sanitary inspection; it is only based on the quantitative determination of fecal bacteria. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that there is no correlation between bacterial and viral infections. Accordingly it is very important to establish new parameters capable of determining the tolerance of shellfish towards enteroviruses. For this reason, the D.C. no. 199/313/CE of 4/29/1999 indicates different procedures for the depuration of stalling water for molluscs which can eliminate enteric viruses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inactivation kinetics of enteroviruses with sodium hypochlorite, peracetic acid, chlorine dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide tested on viral dilutions and then inoculated in cell cultures. The efficacy of the inactivation process was evaluated by calculating the infectious titre. Inactivation kinetics were also studied using RT-nested PCR in contaminated live shellfish.",

This difference was also confirmed on treatment with peracetic acid, while hydrogen peroxide, considering its low concentrations, was the most effective inactivator. The results showed that enteroviruses are resistant towards the most common disinfectants used in depuration systems. Following an initial decrease in the first titre count, viruses persist at a low concentration for a long period which is possibly affected by other factors such as pH and temperature. Positive samples found using RT-nested PCR could be due to the higher sensitivity of this method which can detect as few as 10 viral particles. Nevertheless, it has not yet been established whether this positivity can be attributed to viral infecting particles or to nucleic acid residues. Negativity revealed through PCR is very important for evaluation of depuration processes, but this could be affected by the large number of inhibitors that are potentially present within a product. For this reason it is necessary to test the inactivation kinetics of various viral serotypes and to prepare new experimental techniques that can more efficiently guarantee the complete depuration of these products.",

An interesting result of the study is the isolation of two Salmonella spp. strains that were resistant to four antibiotics. The risk that these micro-organisms can cause salmonellosis that cannot be treated with commonly used antibiotics is of great concern. Although the data are preliminary, it is reassuring to know that 100% of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus spp. proved non-resistant to vancomycin and meticillin and that no Enterococcus spp. vancomycin resistant were detected. The isolated strains of Escherichia coli were also tested for antibiotic resistance. However, due to the complexity of the results obtained, the data will be published at a later time. Finally, with regard to the consequence for the consumer, it must be stressed that the microbiological risk represented by meat preparations can only be dramatically reduced when these products are properly cooked.",

Harvey et al. (1995) reported deficient levels of retinol and tocopherol in the tissue and serum of pigs affected by aflatoxicosis; they suggested that greater amounts of vitamins E and A are required by the body during the course of this disease and that both vitamins play a protective and detoxifying role in the presence of aflatoxins. Based on these considerations, the aim of our research was to assess wherether vitamin A and E supplements in AF contaminated feedstuff given to sows during gestation and lactation had a similar protective and detoxifying effect on their offspring.

Portions of the piglet's liver, kidneys, spleen, thymus and lymph-nodes were fixed in formalin, processed and stained following the routine procedure (Luppi et al., 2002) for post mortem examination. Samples of milk were taken from the sows on day 3 and 23 post-partum. The residual aflatoxins were measured by HPLC (Silvotti et al., 1997) .",

Signs of chronic disease were found in the liver with endocytoplasmic vacuolization and a greater amount of connective epimentation surrounding the lobules. Moderate lymphocyte depletion was observed in the splenic cortex and in the lymph-nodes. The malpighian splenic follicles showed signs of poor activations. Apart from slight individual differences, the blood counts were not particularly different between the two groups of piglets. Only MetHb was significantly lower in the AF+VitA/E group than in the controls. As shown in Table I , the CD4 and CD8 subpopulations were significantly reduced and so was the ratio between the intoxicated piglets and the controls.

The disease mainly affects the larval and juvenile stages which show neurological symptoms due to the typical vacuolating lesions in the brain, spinal cord and retina (Munday et al., 2002) . The disease is caused by a virus of the Betanodavirus genus; seven viral species have been classified in this genus (van Regenmortel et al., 2000) . This classification is based on the fish species from which the virus was isolated, but recently the isolation of the same virus from different host species has become very frequent (Ciulli et al., 2002; Castric et al., 2001) . Cross-infection tests highlighted that the capacity of the virus to infect different species is mainly due to the environmental temperature at which the fish are farmed, thus at which the infection occurs, more than the host species itself . Using capsid protein gene analysis it was possible to classify four genotypes of Betanodavirus: Striped Jack Nervous Necrosis Virus (SJNNV), Tigger Puffer Nervous Necrosis Virus (TPNNV), Barfin Flounder Nervous Necrosis Virus (BFNNV) and Redspotted Grouper Nervous Necrosis Virus (RGNNV; Nishizawa et al., 1997) . Iwamoto et al. (1999) demonstrated the different infection temperature ranges for the four genotypes. Both the infection and disease seem to be very temperature-dependent, in fact most of the outbreaks happen in the summer season.",

Among the various donor species, pigs seem to be the best choice because they are available in a large number, can be housed in controlled specific pathogen free (SPF) environments and have anatomic and physiological features similar to humans. Despite these favourable conditions, xenotransplantation has two main problems. The first is the immunological incompatibility between pigs and humans which results in hyperacute rejection, and the second is the potential transmission of pathogens, especially endogenous retroviruses. The development of transgenic pigs with no or low expression of Gal a(1-3)Gal antigen and with human cell surface complement regulators may overcome hyperacute rejection (Hammer et al., 1985) . However, the potential transmission of pig endogenous retroviruses from the xenograft cannot be eliminated by modern gene knock-out technology and is still a potential risk. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find some means of inhibiting PERV replication and production from two pig cell lines following treatment with some antiretroviral drugs commonly used in human medicine, as well as evaluating the potential tumorigenicity of these viruses for nude mice.",

            "text": "Respiratory infections are widespread in the cat population and they are often associated with several pathogens such as FHV-1, FCV and Chlamydophila spp. (Gaskell and Dawson, 1998) . The definitive diagnosis of feline herpesvirosis and feline chlamydophilosis requires the isolation of their aetiological agents, since serology alone does not allow us to distinguish infected animals from vaccinated ones. FHV-1 isolation using cell cultures is easily performed, even if some cats can show negative results because of (i) inadequate amount of virus present in the ocular and/or pharyngeal swabs, (ii) presence of antibodies in the extra-cellular liquids able to inhibit viral replication in vitro, (iii) contemporaneous presence in the swabs of FCV that could disguise the cytopathic effect induced by FHV-1. As regards Chlamydophila felis these problems are increased by the objective difficulty of the isolation that can be performed through inoculation of embryonate eggs of chicken. To remove these disadvantages it is useful to utilize the techniques of molecular biology, such as the polymerase chain reaction, which is able to detect specific sequences of DNA. Furthermore, it is possible to proceed from the amplicons to the identification of the chlamydofiles after treatment with restriction enzymes. The aims of the current research are (i) to report the results of a study performed by duplex-PCR specific for FHV-1 and Chlamydophila spp. in a population of 40 cats with U.R.T.D.-related symptoms in order to appraise the prevalence of two of the most common agents associated with respiratory infections, and (ii) to identify Chlamydophila felis using restriction enzymes. 296 ",

The results divided according to the vaccination against FHV-1 reveal that most of the positive swabs originated from animals that had not been submitted to vaccination. As regards Chlamydophila spp. the highest number of positive swabs originated from animals treated with non-specific antibiotic therapy (7/27). Another interesting aspect concerns the type of swabs collected. In fact only the ocular swabs were positive for Chlamydophila spp., while the results were more complicated for FHV-1. Indeed, three animals had positive pharyngeal swabs, four had positive ocular ones and eighteen had positive results for both.

In fact, it must be underlined that while for Chlamydophila spp. positive results were found only in swabs from conjunctiva, for FHV-1 the infection was diagnosed on swabs collected from both conjunctiva and/or tonsils. Restriction analysis applied to positive amplified sequences highlighted a substantial uniformity in the nine strains, and therefore, all are identifiable as belonging to the Chlamydophila felis species. The correspondence of the results obtained using single specific PCRs towards each pathogen and those from duplex-PCR shows that this last method has identical diagnostic features to the specific PCR. The use of a single test which is able to identify both pathogens simultaneously, is particularly important, since it permits early diagnosis, using a test that has a higher sensitivity and specificity than the traditional techniques.",

The possible transmission of the disease from animal to man, the inability of the detection of the pathologic form of the prion protein (PrPres) before the appearance of symptoms and the lack of effective therapies against the infection make the development of prophylactic measures against TSE urgent, even if these are not easy to achieve due to the very low immunogenicity of the prion protein (Hill et al., 1997; Mabbott et al., 2001) . Encouraging results have been obtained in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease and experimental scrapie in murine models using repeated injections of synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins: therefore, it seems to be possible to bypass the immune tolerance toward self proteins by using proper immunization protocols (Schenk et al., 1999; Sigurdsson et al., 2002) . In this work we investigated whether active immunization of hamsters using synthetic peptides that reproduce different parts of the sequence of the homologous PrP and a fragment of human PrP can prevent or influence the evolution of the experimental prion disease.

Five boosters with the same antigens were given at 20 day intervals after the challenge. The brains of the animals that died during experimentation were removed and cut midsagittally; one cerebral hemisphere was kept in 20 ml of 10% formalin for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. The presence and spread of typical neurological lesions and PrPres deposits in the brain were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin staining, the deposits of pathologic prion protein was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti PrP (kindly provided by the Health Ministry) and revealed using a peroxidase labelled anti-rabbit serum.

Different anti-prionic compounds have been shown to be effective in vitro, and some of the molecules tested are able to prolong the incubation period of the disease in experimentally infected animals (Brown, 2002) . Alzheimer's Disease and prion diseases share a number of common features: both are characterized by the generation of misfolded proteins (PrPres in prion disease), causing amyloid deposits in the CNS. The capability of Clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline) to dissolve amyloid plaques in post-mortem brain tissue from Alzheimer's patients, and also to dissolve Alzheimer-like plaques in transgenic mice has recently been shown (Melov, 2002) . Clioquinol acts as a zinc and copper chelator: the interaction with metals seems to be involved in the deposition and stabilization of amyloid plaques, therefore chelating agents can interfere with abnormal protein deposition by preventing metal/A-b amyloid interaction, (Cuajungco et al., 2000) . Since copper and zinc binding is probably also involved in PrPres conversion, we have tested the anti-prionic activity of Clioquinol on hamsters experimentally infected with scrapie.",

Moreover, they may be found both in wild fish and those cultured for human consumption (Colorni, 1992; Dos Santos et al., 2002) . Besides inducing mortality in fish, they represent a potential hazard for man, being included among zoonoses (Ghittino and Bozzetta, 1994) . Mycobacterioses are caused by ubiquitous bacteria that are highly resistant in the aquatic environment and are difficult to control. Mycobacterium fortuitum, M. marinum and M. chelonae are the most commonly isolated species. They are all capable of inducing human cutaneous infections, with development of nodular lesions that are generally localized in the limbs (Ghittino, 1985) . In fish, symptoms appear late, are non-specific and include slow growth, lethargy, anorexia and starvation. Lesions in the skin and typical whitish nodules in the viscera may be detected at necropsy (Ghittino, 1992) . Therapy is rather difficult, both for the fact that early diagnosis is seldom achieved and for the lack of effective drugs (Ghittino, 1985) .",

Portions of liver, spleen and kidney were fixed in a 10% formalin solution, processed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Ziehl-Neelsen for histological examination. A specific bacteriological examination was carried out on all fish. The entire specimen, in the case of small fish, or the viscera, for larger fish, were minced, diluted in deionized sterile water, homogenized and filtered. This solution was decontaminated with HPC (1:1), centrifuged and the pellet obtained was inoculated into selective media (Loewenstein-Jensen and Stonebrink), and incubated at 30\u00b0C until colonies developed. Colonies that were positive at Ziehl-Neelsen were subcultured to perform biochemical identification. The tests utilized were nitrates reduction, urease, growth on 5% NaCl medium, growth at 37\u00b0C, growth on McConkey agar without crystal violet, niacin, Tween hydrolysis, arylsulfatase, cold catalase and catalase at 68\u00b0C for 20 min.",

Visceral nodules had a size of 0.5-12 mm and were variable in number. 17 out of the remaining 37 fish without tubercular lesions but identified as being positive by imprint, were positive on histological examination. Granulomas, at different stages of development, were found in the liver, spleen and kidney. These were made of epithelioid cells containing acid-fast bacteria, surrounded by a thick connective capsule. Out of 135 isolates of mycobacteria, 109 were phenotypically identified as Mycobacterium fortuitum, 16 as M. chelonae, 5 as M. marinum, 3 as M. terrae and 2 as M. gordonae. Mixed infections, caused by different mycobacterial species, were never observed in the same fish sample. The most common freshwater fish affected by Mycobacterioses were the gold fish (Carassius auratus), the Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), Colisa lalia and Barbus tetrazona. Among marine fish the most affected species was found to be Zebrasoma veliferum.",

Economic losses are related to the drop in milk production due to progressive pneumonia, lameness, and mastitis. Phylogenetic studies have been carried out using ovine or caprine viral strains obtained from different geographical regions and recent data suggest that a differentiation of SRLV based on host species origin may not be accurate (Zanoni, 1998) . This is consistent with the identification of Maedi-Visna Virus (MVV)-like strains in goat and Caprine Arthritis-Encephalitis Virus (CAEV)like strain in sheep. Recently a new cluster of ovine lentivirus isolates, related to CAEV has been described in France and Italy (Leroux et al., 1997; Grego et al., 2002) . Phylogenetic studies have mainly been carried out using pol gene fragments, while limited information is available for gene fragments encoding major structural proteins involved in the antibody response and used for the development of serological tests. The use of a single strain-based immunoassay in detecting sheep and goat lentivirus infection is based on the finding that immunodominant regions are mainly crossreactive among ovine isolates, as well as between ovine and caprine lentiviruses (Gogolewski et al., 1985) . However, recent studies suggest that the heterogeneity of the immunodominant epitope of the capsid antigen may affect sensitivity of serological tests based on a single strain (Grego et al., 2002) . In this study the gag gene of two genetically distinct ovine lentiviruses was characterized and epitope variability in the matrix protein (p16) and in the maior capsid antigen (p25) was evaluated.",

The gag gene sequences of strain It561 and It-Pi1 were aligned with the consensus sequence of the SRLV sequences available in the GenBank database.

Most ovine isolates (8 out of 9) belonged to the same cluster of It-Pi1 named CAEV-like. Thus, in Italy, many of the infected ovine population harbour viral strains which are different from those employed in the currently available diagnostic immunoassays. In fact, in different commercially available ELISAs, recombinant antigens have been developed from the classical ovine lentivirus genotype (i.e. SAOVV, EV1, ZZV1050) (Saman et al., 1999; Zanoni et al., 1991) . This genotype is still circulating in our country, as demonstrated by isolation of strain It-561. The genetic variability of the field isolated raises a question regarding the validity of the single genotype-based serological test. This study clearly shows that immunodominant regions of two structural proteins are quite variable in the two ovine genotypes. A more accurate epitope characterization using overlapping fragments revealed a common or less variable N-terminal epitope and a distinct C-terminal epitope. Thus, the cross-reactivity between different genotypes is given by these and other conserved sequences. However, a subset of infected population may be partially reactive against common epitopes and not be detected using a diagnostic test based on the heterologous genotype. For CAEV infected goat flocks we observed that the homologous antigen is able to detect an additional 7% of seropositive animals as compared with heterologous antigen (Grego et al., 2002) . The systematic use of a single strain immunoassay in an infected population, followed by slaughtering of seropositive animals may select for ''diagnostic test escape'' viral mutants, thus interfering with eradication programs.",

            "text": "Physical examination and standard electrocardiography have been used for several years to check the cardiac electrical activity and in particular to detect cardiac arrhythmias. Routine electrocardiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias in practice. However, as a standard ECG lasts 1 or 2 min, that is to say 0.07-0.14% of 24 h, its sensitivity to cardiac arrhythmias is correlated with the frequency at which they occur. ECG sensitivity is high for continuous arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation in the dog, or very frequent arrhythmias, such as certain cases of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), but is very low for detection of sporadic arrhythmias such as parossistic tachycardia. Furthermore, standard ECG requires the patient to be restrained in right lateral recumbency, influencing the autonomic nervous system and potentially inducing or suppressing cardiac arrhythmias (Doxey et al., 1985) . In 1963 N.J. Holter proposed monitoring of cardiac rhythm for 24-48 h using a portable recorder to look for arrhythmias during the normal activity of the patient in order to increase the sensitivity of the ECG to cardiac arrhythmias. Nowadays 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter monitoring) is widely used in human medicine, and less commonly in veterinary medicine, to detect cardiac arrhythmias in patients affected by syncope, sudden weakness or sudden dyspnoea, and to assess the efficacy of antiarrhythmic treatment. Furthermore, Holter monitoring can be useful for an early diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias in particular dog breeds in which arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies are inherited or where modifications of the cardiac rhythm are associated with extracardiac disease.",

We shaved the thorax bilaterally over the middle and ventral third of the ribs, between the 5th and the 8th rib on the right side and between the 3rd and 7th rib on the left. We cleaned the skin using gauze with alcohol in order to remove sebum and dirt from the surface and to ensure a good contact between electrodes and the skin. We used selfadhesive electrocardiographic patches with 2.4 cm diameter. Each patch was covered with self-adhesive tape to avoid their displacement or detatchment. Seven electrodes were placed in order to obtain 3 leads with a V1, V3, V5 modified system (Gershwin, 1975; Doxey et al., 1985; Elie and Hoenig, 1995) . Electrocardiographic patches and their wires were secured using a strip of self-adhesive tape that fixed the recorder between the scapulae on the withers region. The recorder was further secured to the patient using a 3M VetrapTM elastic bandage that also covered the wires and the patches. Two loops of elastic bandage were crossed between the forelimbs to give more stability to the recorder and electrodes and to avoid them moving caudally and laterally. Each dog went back home with its owner who had to check the patient during recording to avoid damage to the recorder and to note all activity of the patient. The recording was then processed using the Holter Win P-V 5.40 Analyser installed on a notebook. The analysis was based on the general morphologic ECG features of the analyser but it was possible to modify and to upgrade them constantly before, during and after the automatic analysis. The tables with maximum, minimum and mean heart rate, supraventricular and ventricular ectopies and full disclosure of the recording were printed out for each patient.",

The thrombomodulin-thrombin complex induces coagulation by activation of protein C that inactivates the intrinsic pathway plasma factors V and VIII, finally blocking the formation of new thrombin. Plasma TM is mainly produced by endothelial cells and to a lesser extent by lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, etc. Several studies performed, both in humans and laboratory animals, showed that TM levels were increased during haemostatic disorders (disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombosis, etc) and during several diseases that induce endothelial damage (such as diabetes mellitus, lupus erythematosus and atopia), and renal and hepatic involvement, rickettsiosis, etc. The main characteristics of such diseases are micro and macroangiopathies due both to direct action of infective agents or to immune activity. The presence of vasculites has also been reported during leishmaniasis and it can be responsible for a very severe and often fatal evolution of the disease (Pumarola et al., 1991) . Antigen-antibody immunocomplexes deposit in the endothelium inducing complement activation and inflammation. In canine leishmaniasis clinical signs such as renal failure, uveitis, arthritis, etc. are generally due to this autoimmune process. When these clinical signs are evident it is generally too late for a therapeutic approach, therefore, identification of markers for early detection of endothelial damage can be of great help to the veterinarian. The object of this study was to evaluate plasma TM concentrations in dogs affected by leishmaniasis at different grades of clinical involvement, in order to verify if plasma TM could also be utilized in dogs, as in humans, as a marker for endothelial injury. Moreover, the study of such a marker could lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in this zoonosis.",

The effect on haemostasis is complex and not all the haemostasis alterations reported in the literature can be found at once in a dog with leishmaniasis because of the typical clinical polymorphism of the disease.

These cytokines play a key role in the pathogenesis of cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS) induced both by chronic administration of chemotherapeutic drugs and the tumour itself. Recently, Mantovani et al. (1998) demonstrated that high doses of Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), a semisynthetic progestin, and Megestrol acetate (MA) reduce serum levels of interleukin-I (IL-I) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in vivo for cancer patients with CACS leading to beneficial therapeutic effects. Moreover, clinical use of anthracyclines for the treatment of several malignant tumours has been limited both by a dose-dependent cardiotoxicity and drug resistance. Therefore, the clinical use of such chemosensitizers remains questionable and the identification of more active but less toxic compounds is needed. Our recent studies, in chronic lymphatic leukaemia cells, have demonstrated that MPA reduces Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased by anthracyclines (Pagnini et al., 2000) . In this study we evaluated the activity of two myocardial antioxidant enzymes, copperzinc superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the plasma of rats treated per os for 15 days with Idarubicin (IDA) and Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), either used alone or in combination.

Such oxidative stress is not only responsible for the cancer genesis but also for both an anthracycline-induced toxicity effect and anorexia/cachexia. It has been reported that, as the cancer-related anorexia/cachexia syndrome (CACS) is correlated with cytokine levels, it is consequently also correlated with oxidative stress. It has been recently demonstrated that high doses of Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and Megestrol acetate provide protection from CACS by modulating cytokines and serotonin production and that such an effect is related to oxidative stress. Our results showed that high doses of MPA reduce the inhibition of Cu-Zn SOD and Catalase induced by idarubicin. In conclusion, these data are in agreement with those of other authors, showing that IDA-induced oxidative stress can be reduced by administration 338 of high doses of MPA. In this way, both reduction in cardiotoxicity and beneficial therapeutic effects can be achieved.",

These genes, mainly belonging to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), seem to enhance the development of antipancreatic T lymphocytes (Zamani et al., 1998) . Although there is evidence for the inheritance and immune mediated pathogenesis of IDDM in dogs, the genes involved in the spontaneous disease have not been identified and may vary from breed to breed (Gershwin, 1975; Kramer et al., 1988; Elie and Hoenig, 1995; Klimmer et al., 2002) . A familial predisposition for IDDM has been described for Samoyeds (Kimmler et al., 2002) , Keeshonds (Kramer et al., 1988) , Golden Retrievers (Williams et al., 1980) and Poodles (Gershwin, 1975) . Epidemiological studies on the risk of developing diabetes mellitus (DM) in dogs have mainly been focused on North American canine populations (Marmor et al., 1982; Hess et al., 2000) . To the best of our knowledge only one epidemiological survey has been carried out in Europe (Doxey et al., 1985) . Unfortunately this study did not show the results obtained in detail and probably for this reason very common Italian breeds were not mentioned. From anecdotal reports, some breeds such as the English Setter and Irish Setter may be at high risk of developing DM in Italy.",

Inclusion criteria consisted of persistent hyperglycemia with glycosuria and at least two common clinical signs of DM (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss or polyphagia) or glucosuria with ketonuria. 39 dogs were excluded from the study because they had insufficient data for diagnosis (a single result of either hyperglycemia or glycosuria without clinical information about the dog), or transient (diestral) or secondary DM. At the end of this selection, the case series included 186 dogs with DM that had been admitted to our Teaching Hospital between January 1995 and December 2002. 13857 dogs without DM had been admitted to the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences during the same period and this was considered the comparison group. Of 135 different breeds (including the mixed-breed category) admitted to the Clinic over the period of the study, 23 (including the mixed-breed category) had at least one dog with DM. Statistical analysis was restricted to those breeds where the sum of observed and expected values for diabetic subjects (calculated by multiplying the number of subjects in each breed by the percentage of diabetics in the whole population studied) was>4. This procedure ensured that a sufficient numbers of dogs was considered in order to document breeds at low and high risk of developing DM. The odds ratio was calculated for each breed by choosing mixed breed dogs as the reference breed (odds ratio=1). A 95% confidence interval was also calculated. A value of p<0.05 was considered significant and <0.001 highly significant.",

It was impossible to collect a blood sample because of the occurrence of respiratory crisis during sampling. Electrocardiography was performed with the cat in right lateral recumbency, using a Nihon Kohden -Eclaps 12 -ECG 8110R instrument. Radiography was performed with a latero-lateral projection (left to right). M-mode, b-mode and Doppler echocardiographic evaluations were performed through the clipped right parasternal window and clipped apical and caudal left parasternal windows. The ultrasound machines used were a Kontron ''Vetson Color'', with a micro-convex 6.5 MHz probe and a Medison AS-8800, provided with a microconvex multi-frequency (8-5 MHz) transducer.

The test that appeared to be most useful for confirmation of the diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot was echocardiography. In fact ultrasonography gave a correct intra vitam diagnosis, despite the fact that the probes normally used in veterinary medicine are not very adaptable to small acoustic windows. The fact that the murmur was also heard on the right side of the chest is probably due to the radiation of the murmur caused by pulmonic stenosis and/or to the blood flow through the ventricular septal defect or through the ascending tract of the ''overriding aorta''. This kind of murmur is less loud when the ventricular septal defect is so large that turbulences are absent. Another reason is when haematic hyperviscosity, due to polycythemia consequent to persistent hypoxia, is also present (Kirby and Gillick, 1974) , like in our case.",

It can be made when the presence of an elevated ACA level occurs in addition to a thrombotic event associated with vascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent foetal loss, or with haemolytic anaemia, livedo reticularis, and neurologic disorders Olmstead, 2001; Quintero del Rio, 2002) . It is worth noting that at least two of the four dogs in group V had clinical manifestations, history and laboratory abnormalities which would be suggestive of APS for humans. An eight-year-old female boxer was referred because of spondylarthrosis with a history of infertility and recurrent foetal loss; laboratory abnormalities showed serious thrombocytopenia (platelet count 101\u00d7103/ml; reference range 240-400\u00d7103/ml) as well as a very high ACA level. A three-year-old male crossbreed was referred because of progressive blindness and retinal thrombosis was diagnosed, together with a very high ACA level. Therefore, our report shows that ACA are present in both healthy and diseased dogs, can be easily detected using the ELISA technique, and can reach very high levels, suggesting a possible role in the pathogenesis of some disorders of dogs. However, at present, it is not possible to affirm that APS can exist in dogs. The present findings are too preliminary and still too limited to allow such a conclusion. Further investigation is certainly needed to clarify the role, if any, of ACA in dogs.",

However, in the veterinary field, this line of research is still in its infancy. Few studies have been made on the quantification of the cytokines present in dairy milk and these have been conducted only on non-mastitic animals (Leutenegger et al., 2000) . The evaluation of the cytokine profiles in dairy milk has previously been achieved using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, both for healthy and mastitic cows (Peli et al., 2003) . In this study, cytokine quantification in dairy milk was determined using the relatively newly developed realtime TaqManA reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real-time TaqManA RT-PCR) method. A comparison was made between healthy cows and animals affected by mastitis, the latter having a high (>5.0\u00d7105) or a low (<1.5\u00d7105) number of milk somatic cells as measured by the Somatic Cell Count (SCC) test. All milk samples were analysed for the presence of three cytokines, chosen because of their key role in the immunological regulatory process: IL-8 (chemotactic activity), TNF-a (pro-inflammatory activity) and IL-10 (regulatory/anti-inflammatory activity).",

            "text": "Milk was collected from 15 Italian Friesian dairy cows at mid-lactation. Two 50 ml aliquots of milk were manually and aseptically collected from each udder quarter. One aliquot was used for the standardised bacteriology and SCC procedures and the second was used to extract the mRNA coding for the three cytokines TNF-a, IL-8 and IL-10. For each animal only the milk sampled from one of the udder quarters was used, which was selected on the basis of the bacteriological and SCC test results. All milk cells were concentrated by centrifugation at 700G for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant and the fat layer were discarded and the resulting pellet was washed twice in cold PBS (pH 7.4), and then re-suspended in 250-500 ml of PBS. The mRNA was extracted from a 15 ml starting volume of each milk sample, using the Micro Fast-Track mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen), and re-suspended in 50 ml of nucleasefree H 2 O (Promega). All the extracted mRNAs were kept at \u221280\u00b0C until use. To quantify the expression of the cytokines coding for mRNA in the samples, the realtime TaqManA PCR method, capable of detecting less than 1 mg of mRNA, was used. A housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), was simultaneously processed in Real-time TaqManA PCR for each sample, as an endogenous control. This was done to normalise the process for the variability in the number of cells in the original samples, for differences in extraction efficiency, for mRNA degradation in the starting material, and for reverse transcriptase reaction efficiency. The primers and the probe used for the detection and quantification of the IL-10 cytokine were designed by us using sequence data available in GenBankA, and were achieved with the aid of the Primer Express software (PE Applied Biosystems). The forward and reverse primers are located in two adjacent exons, while the probe lies in-between them to hybridise at the junction of the two exons. The primers and probes for the IL-8 and TNF-a cytokines, and for the endogenous control (GAPDH), were obtained from the literature (Leutenegger et al., 2000) . Each TaqManA probe was labelled at the 5\u221e end with fluorochrome FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) and with fluorochrome TAMRA (6-carboxytetramethyl-rodamine) at the 3\u221e end (PE Applied Biosystems). The Real-time PCR and reverse transcription of the mRNA target was performed using a ''one-step'' reaction method, in a final volume of 25 ml. The primers were used at a concentration of 400 nM each, while the probe was used at a concentration of 80 nM, in the reaction buffer (One-Step PCR MasterMix; PE Applied Biosystems), which also contained the reverse transcriptase enzyme and the AmpliT aqGoldA enzyme. Finally, 1 ml of extracted mRNA was added to the mixture. The reverse transcription, and real-time TaqManA PCR, was executed in the ABI PrismA 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems), and was done as follows: a 30 min cycle at 48\u00b0C, a 10 min cycle at 95\u00b0C, then 50 alternating cycles each of 15 s at 95\u00b0C, and of 60 s at 60\u00b0C. Cytokine quantification was achieved using the Ct (Cycle threshold) comparative method, and is expressed as ''n-fold upregulation of cytokine transcription'' in relation to a calibrator which is represented by the smallest signal detectable for that specific cytokine.",

The analytical method was able to quantify all the cytokines in all 15 samples examined, and thus confirms the utility of this method for the study of cytokine gene expression in milk. The results, expressed as group mean values of the three cytokines analysed, are shown in Fig. 1 . The levels of TNF-a were significantly higher in animals with positive bacteriology (Groups A and B) than in Group C (negative bacteriology), and are not linked to SCC. This result confirms that a bacterial infection, independent of any chemotactic effect, stimulates an increase in Figure 1 . Mean values of the three cytokines analysed in milk cells from groups A, B and C. Cytokine transcription is expressed as the n-fold differences to the calibrator, which was the lowest detectable cytokine signal. Note the semilogarithmic scale 362 the production of TNF-a (which causes a local inflammatory response). To the contrary, in samples with high SCC (Group A), levels of IL-8 were higher than seen in the low SCC Groups B and C. This confirms the chemotactic role (mostly on the neutrophils) of this cytokine the synthesis of which does not seem to be induced by the presence of bacteria, as is the case for TNF-a, and as deduced from the lower levels of this cytokine detected for Group B (Barber and Yang, 1998) . These data confirm recent findings which show that an increase of TNF-a is not necessary to stimulate the synthesis of IL-8 in the mammary gland (Personn et al., 2003) . As regards IL-10, the results seem to show a correlation with SCC, but the lack of published data on the precise role and origin of this cytokine in the ruminant mammary gland indicates the need for further studies for the explanation of our results. Much research remains to be done on the interactive role of these bacteria and their influence on the quantitative profiles of cytokines in the ruminant udder.",

All horses were clinically normal, while dogs were divided into a control group of healthy dogs and a group of patients with diseases that could affect arterial blood pressure. Measurements were performed using MemoprintTM, an electronic device product by Medvet, that assesses the diastolic and systolic blood pressure and the mean heart rate. Four cuffs of different size were available, two for large and medium size dogs, one for small dogs and cats and one for horses. For the dog measurements were performed with the patient in sternal or lateral recumbence with the cuff constricting the distal third of the left forelimb, attempting to maintain the cuff on the same horizontal plane as the heart in order to evaluate the radial artery pulse. At least five measurements were performed for each dog and the weighted mean was then calculated. For horses the cuff was placed around the base of the tail (coccigeal artery) and three measurements and the arithmetical mean were recorded. We divided the animals into 9 groups, ordered as follows: Gr A: two-year-old foals, 8 males and 7 females; Gr B: 10 Standardbreds, 6 male, 1 neutered male and 3 females; Gr C: 8 non-athletic horses, 4 castrated males and 4 females; Gr D: 11 clinically healthy dogs, 8 males and 3 females; Gr E: 10 dogs affected by chronic renal failure, 5 males and 5 females; Gr F: 6 dogs affected by diabetes, 2 males and 4 females; Gr G: 7 dogs with heartworm disease, 4 males and 3 females classes II-III; Gr H: 9 dogs with chronic mitral regurgitation, 5 males and 4 females, 7 in treatment for congestive heart failure; Gr I: 6 dogs affected by atrial fibrillation, 5 males and 1 female, 2 undergoing treatment for arrhythmia.",

The pressure measured for different groups of horses was similar (mean systolic pressure=113 and diastolic=72). This is interesting if we consider that in human medicine it is well known that athletes' blood pressure is lower than that of normal people and that this decrease in mean arterial pressure can be used as an index of performance (Ellestad, 1987) . By the statistical analysis of our results we conclude, on the contrary, that athletic training is not able to modify the arterial pressure for horses; therefore the arterial pressure cannot be used as a performance index. In normal dogs the mean systolic pressure was 143 mmHg and the diastolic pressure was 79 mmHg. These values are not so different from those obtained in other studies using the direct technique (Mishina et al., 1997) . Also for the dog we did not find any difference between males and females as described in the literature of human and veterinary medicine (Mishina et al., 1997) .

            "text": "Arterial blood pressures, both systolic and diastolic, were statistically higher for dogs affected by chronic renal failure and dirofilariasis than control dogs, while for diabetic dogs only the diastolic values were higher. No differences were evident between dogs with cardiac disease, whether undergoing treatment or not, and normal dogs. Our study highlights the clinical usefulness and applicability of blood pressure INTRODUCTION Ochratoxin A is a naturally occurring mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus ocraceus, mainly in tropical regions, and Penicillum verrucosum mainly in temperate areas. Ochratoxin A consists of a polyketide-derived dihydroxy-coumarin moiety linked through the 12-carboxy group to phenylalanine (Beretta, 1998) . Research in Ochratoxin A (abbreviated as OTA) has increased since 1994, when The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified OTA as a possible human carcinogen, based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animal studies (IARC, 1994) . P. verrucosum grows in cereals in cold climates and, as a result, the presence of OTA is larger in Scandinavia and other cool temperate zone areas of Central Europe. It has been suggested that 50% of OTA intake can be attributed to cereal and cereal products. OTA has a potent toxicity and its nephrotoxic and carcinogenic effects in all mammalian species have been demonstrated. OTA's toxic action seems to be more dangerous than that of Aflatoxin (Muller, 2003) . Daily intakes of 1 mg/kg BW for 5-6 days can be lethal. OTA mainly affects protein synthesis and subsequently DNA and RNA synthesis. It is a powerful competitive inhibitor on phenylalanine-tRNA ligase, reducing protein synthesis as a result of its inhibitory action. It seems certain that the supply of phenylalanine can reduce OTA's toxicity. The interest in OTA in zootechny regards only monogastric species as ruminants can convert Ochratoxin A into Ochratoxin a which is less toxic (Abarca, 2003) . Pigs and chickens are the animals most exposed to the toxicity of OTA. It is well known that OTA plays a major role in the aetiology of nephritis in pigs, causing serious kidney lesions, while 372 in poultry OTA can cause neuronal anomalies. In addition, daily intake of OTA can reduce Feed Conversion Rate with subsequent lower growth, and it results in a lower efficiency of the immune system; as a result of kidney damage the animals increase their water consumption. The target organ of toxicity in swine is the kidney, but also the liver which has function of detoxification (Beretta, 1998) . The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of OTA in the diet of growing pigs, concerning liver damage. These effects were evaluated using proteomic methods, monitoring the effects of the administration of OTA on the soluble protein fraction of the liver. The proteomic tools used were high-definition two dimensional electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. 64 Large White x Landrace pigs, half of which were castrated males and half females, from 8 litters, with a mean live weight of 41 kg, were divided into 2 groups of 32 animals each and housed in pens each of which held 8 animals. The control group was given a commercial pig feedstuff (Control diet). The treated group was fed the same feedstuff with the addition of 25 mg/kg Ochratoxin A from Aspergillus ochraceus (OTA 25 mg/kg), obtained from Sigma-Aldrich s.r.l. Milano. The diets were provided ad libitum and the animals had free access to drinking water. The pigs were individually weighed at the start of the trial and after 119 days, before slaughtering. Data were recorded regarding Live Body Weight (BW) and Average Daily Weight Gain (ADG). Feed intakes of each pen were recorded at the end of the trial to calculate the Feed Efficiency. The liver of four pigs from each group was collected at slaughtering, immediately stored at \u221220\u00b0C and then submitted to proteomic investigation.",

The solution was then centrifuged (18000 g) and filtered. The samples contained about 10 mg/ml of proteins and the quantity utilized for electrophoresis was about 1 mg. The IPG strips (home made; range 3-10 and 4-7) were reswelled for 6 h (active: sample was directly put into the buffer), 3 h at 30 V and 3 h at 50 V. The total volume of rehydration was 400 mL, 100 mL of sample for each strip. The run was carried out overnight under a layer of paraffin oil at 15\u00b0C, under a voltage gradient up to 8000 V (IPG-phor, Amersham Biosciences). After equilibration steps with DTT and IAA, the strips were put onto second-dimension gel, which was a classical SDS-PAGE, 10%T. The analytical staining was performed using silver staining protocol, while the preparative staining for the identification of proteins in mass spectrometry was coomassie blue. The spots of interest were excised with a cutter, de-stained with an acetonitrile/ammonia bicarbonate solution and dehydrated with acetonitrile, then incubation was carried out overnight with trypsin at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped at 4\u00b0C and the tryptic digests were analyzed using a MALDI-TOF spectrometer (Tof-Spec 2E, Micromass, Manchester, UK). The comparison of digests was performed in a data bank using a free-on line software, ProFound (www.proteometrics.com). Figures 1 and 2 show two dimensional maps of the soluble protein fraction (liver) of swine (control, left) and added OTA in the diet (right). The matching of the electrophoretograms indicates that there is a greater expression of the a and b chains of haemoglobin in swine undergoing OTA treatment which is probably due to a haemorrhagic status of the liver. In the animals treated with OTA there is an increased expression of different enzymes with related isoforms: carboxypeptidase A, catalase, fumarate-hydratase, phosphatidyl ethanolamine binding protein and inducible NO synthase. These are hepatic enzymes that are indicators of hepatic and energetic stress. This investigation shows some important differences between the proteins expressed by hepatic tissue under stress conditions; such proteins are not identified with routine analysis. Proteomic investigations are a useful tool in the identification of diagnostic markers.",

Equine Cushing-like syndrome is due to hyperplasia or adenoma formation of the pituitary pars intermedia. A possible cause is the reduction of negative regulation of dopamine on ACTH secretion because of a hypothalamic disease (Dybdal, 1997) . Considering this etiopathogenesis a more appropriate description of the disease is probably Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID) (Schott, 1997) . PPID is relatively frequent in old horses (>18 years) with no apparent sex predisposition although authors have suggested that females are afflicted more than males (Boujon et al., 1993; Heinrichs, 1990) . The characteristic clinical signs include: weight loss secondary to muscle wasting, exercise intolerance, pendulous abdomen, hirsutism and curly hair coat, polyuria and polydipsia, hyperhydrosis, delayed wound healing (Thompson et al., 1995) and bulging supraorbital fat pads as a result of fat redistribution.",

Since this official record is able to provide an accurate picture of the clinical situation of the animal, the choices made by the doctor and the evolution of the illness, on one hand it constitutes an important source of information for historical health research and the aims of scientific research and statistical analysis, and on the other hand allows any parties suffering damage to reconstruct and evaluate the behaviour of the veterinary doctor and ascertain any professional responsibility. In order to fulfil these tasks correctly, it is considered that case histories must contain at least the following essential information, naturally in addition to the identification data concerning the structure and the veterinary doctor responsible for the case: a) general details of the animal's owner; b) species, race, sex and age of the animal; c) reason for the visit or hospitalisation; d) anamnesis; e) clinical inspection and general controls carried out, and their results; f ) collateral exams carried out; g) diagnosis; h) prognosis; i) therapy; j) course of the illness.",

Although concise, some guidelines can however be found in the instructions governing human medicine. In particular, article 35 of the Italian Ministerial Law (D.M.) of the 27th of June 1986 -determining the requirements for private clinics -sets out that a case history must be completed for every patient, from which the following should be documented: ''complete personal data, diagnosis on arrival, family and personal anamnesis, objective examination, laboratory and specialist examinations, diagnosis, therapy, results and after-effects''. This law also foresees that ''... the regular updating of the case history during hospitalisation is the responsibility of the chief consultant or head of service, while the filing and issue of copies to all those who are entitled to receive them is the responsibility of the medical director''. Clearly the above regulation is designed for the management of case histories in the field of human medicine and, more particularly, in the case of private clinics; however the rules contained in the law also appear to be a useful model for use in veterinary practice, providing helpful indications for correct and suitable behaviour. In law, the function of case histories is described as follows: they are ''a diary of the course of an illness and other relevant clinical factors''(1) and ''certify the therapy undertaken'' (2) . More particularly, it states that such records ''confirm their function as a diary, and the facts must be written down as they happen'' (3) . Concerning the content, it is specified that ''in the records the diagnosis, progression of the illness and therapies administered on each occasion are noted''(4), ''as well as any operations carried out, the results of therapy and the length of the patient's stay in hospital'' (5) . It follows that, above all in university clinics and veterinary hospitals, where it is almost inevitable that such notes are made by more than one person, it is good practice that each note be initialled by the person making it.",

Concerning this matter Piccini (1993) states: ''The legal nature of case histories has not yet been firmly defined, meaning whether they should be considered a real public deed that can be used as privileged evidence, or as mere hospital documents with technical and medical relevance, or as documents that can be compared to administrative certification'' (6) .

The following article (2700) then specifies the validity of the document, stating that the ''official record constitutes full evidence unless subject to a summons challenging its origin by the P.O who has drawn it up, as well as the declarations from the 383 parties and other events that the P.O. declares to have taken place in his presence, or to have been carried out by him''. Of particular interest to this study, an official record is deemed to be any document drawn up by the P.O. for any purposes inherent to his functions and this even includes purely internal records drawn up with the aim of documenting matters relating to the activities he carries out and the regularity of the administrative operations for which he is responsible (8).",

Having therefore established, albeit briefly, what should be considered an official record, and when a veterinary case history can be considered official, we now need to examine how, and which parts of, an official record (and more particularly a case history) can be considered privileged evidence (as established in the mentioned article 2700 of the Italian Civil Code), meaning that it takes precedence over other sources of evidence. On this matter, legal doctrine deems that privileged evidence cannot concern the whole of an official record, but needs to be reserved and limited to only some of its parts, and more specifically: a) to the declarations by the parties and other events that the P.O. declares to have taken place in his presence; b) to the actions that the P.O. declares to have carried out personally. As far as the remaining parts are concerned, opinions (or judgements) expressed by the P.O. in the document, these cannot be considered privileged evidence and therefore these declarations may be proved to the contrary (10).",

Troponin is composed of three subunits, namely troponin C (TnC), troponin I (TnI), and troponin T (TnT), which binds tropomyosin. There are three different isoforms of TnT and TnI, two of which are specific for skeletal muscle, while the third is specific for the myocardium (cTnT and cTnI). As the homology between troponins is about 95% among mammals, commercial diagnostic kits designed for use in humans also provide excellent results in other animals. .",

For diagnostic purposes, one advantage is that these proteins are normally absent in blood in subjects without myocardial damage. Even minimal increases in the serum levels of these proteins are indicative of myocardial damage and, in the case of cTnT, it is detectable in serum from 2 h to 14 days following the onset of myocardial damage. Moreover, in contrast to the isozymes of CK and LDH, the results are not influenced by use of different clinical samples (hemolytic, lipemic, bile samples). The degree of increase in the level of cTnT is relatively proportional to the degree of myocardial damage, with prognostic implications as well. At the same time, the extreme sensitivity of this technique also allows for its use in other nonischemic pathologies including chronic cardiac insufficiency, pulmonary emboli, acute myocarditis, systemic hypertension, arrhythmias, and toxicity from doxorubicin (De Francesco, 2002) . In veterinary medicine, O'Brien et al. (1997) have demonstrated the utility of measuring the levels of cTnT in the diagnosis of experimentally induced myocardial damage.",

Values of cTnT less than 0.05 were considered negative (expressed in ng/ml). Values of cTnT between 0.05-0.1, 0.1-2, and >2 were considered as low, intermediate, and high, respectively. The cTnT levels were measured for a control group of 20 dogs that were judged as healthy on the basis of history and objective clinical examination with particular attention to the cardiovascular system. This group of animals comprised subjects with different races and gender with an age between 1 to 12 years (mean 6.1). Another group of 30 animals was defined as cardiomyopathic on the basis of clinical and instrumental examination (e.g., echocardiograph and ecoDoppler, radiography and EKG). These all had cardiac insufficiencies between 1b and 3a, according to the ISACHC classification. On the basis of echocardiographic examination, the myocardiopathic group was further divided into two subgroups: non-hypokinetic myocardiopathic (12 dogs aged between 3 months and 16 years, mean 7.5) and hypokinetic myocardiopathic (global or segmental hypokinetic; 18 dogs aged between 7 months and 15 years, mean 6.0). Statistical analysis using Fisher's test was employed to evaluate the correlation between a positive cTnT test and cardiac insufficiency, as well as ventricular kinetics. The aim of the present work was to determine the value of cTnT for healthy dogs and for dogs affected with different cardiac pathologies, evaluating eventual correlations between cTnT levels, the ISACHC classification for cardiac insufficiency, the index of systolic volume (ESV-I), and ventricular kinetics.",

The results of the present work indicate the usefulness of the cTnT test for the identification of cardiopathic subjects for whom disease is associated with myocardial damage. Furthermore, our data are also interesting in relation to the lack of correlation between a positive cTnT result and the degree of systolic insufficiency. In addition, the observation that only 50% of the hypokinetic group was positive for cTnT suggests that the assay may have particular utility in discriminating animals with myocardial damage in course from those in which hypokinesis is most likely indicative of a previous injury. On the other hand, the positive test results observed in non-hypokinetic, myocardiopathic subjects implies that the measurement of cTnT is a diagnostic tool that is valuable for the identification of myocardial damage, even in animals that would not otherwise be suspected to have myocardial damage on the basis of clinical and instrumental examination.",

Lastly, for the three dogs with dilative myocardiopathy serum cTnT was not detected. This may be explained by the low concentrations of troponin T at the myocardial level, as reported by O'Brien (1997) for Dobermans affected with idiopathic dilative myocardiopathy. Our results are in contrast to those found for humans, in which a relatively high percentage of patients were found to be positive for cTnT during the course of dilative myocardiopathy. It has been reported that the return to normal levels of cTnT following therapy also has a beneficial impact on prognosis, with survival times that are significantly higher . However, in the present study the number of animals with dilative myocardiopathy, all with negative cTnT, is too small to make any conclusions in this regard.",

            "text": "Physiotherapeutic analysis, including postural evaluation of the patient, is very important in rehabilitative medicine (Basaglia, 2000) . Patients with locomotory problems often present altered body and movement patterns. Body Pattern (SC) is defined as: ''the sensation that everyone has of their body position in space and of its movement, formed on the basis of proprioceptive information integrated by visual afferences'' (Buzzi et al., 1996) . In physiology this concept is defined as kinaesthesia (Mountcastle, 1977) or somatic sensation (Ruch, 1976) . Posture is defined as the position the body adopts in space by means of the tonic activity of muscles acting against gravity (Villeneuve, 1996) . Modifications of this body pattern happen, for example, when there is pain in the locomotory apparatus or elsewhere, which leads to a reduction of the range of the movements, to anthalgic and compensatory postures and to substitutive movements or ''tricks''. This situation induces incorrect motory patterns and new body representations which are memorised by the nervous system. The aim of ''neuromotory reprogramming'' is to re-establish the normal body and global kinetic patterns by means of active proprioceptor stimulation and suitable postural exercises. In this paper we wish to present a rehabilitating postural methodology, in which global postural exercises, both static and dynamic, are added to the normal rehabilitation program. The exercise technique needs to be ''global'' as in nature there is no such thing as an isolated single muscle contraction (muscular chains mechanism), as the Nervous System regulates movement as a whole (Souchard, 1994) . Case 1=Male (M), 4 years (y), diagnosis: Hansen 1 disk rupture in T13-L1; haemilaminectomy 3 days after the appearance of para-paresis; beginning of rehabilitation program 14 days after surgery (PR+14d). Case 2=F6y, lumbar disk rupture, no surgery; beginning of rehabilitation program 60 days after the appearance of the symptoms. Case 3=F7y, multiple pelvis fracture. Reconstructive surgery using bone plates 4 days after trauma, PR+35d. Case 4=F6m, bilateral hip dysplasia. Bilateral triple pelvic osteotomy (TPO) 30 days after the appearance of symptoms, PR+20. After examining the postural and body pattern alterations, we made the patients perform postural exercises which led the patient to regain the ability to stand on all fours with the correct body pattern. Moreover, these exercises aimed to strengthen the so-called postural or gravity-opposing muscles, to regain normal mobility and to enhance muscle strength and coordination. Coordination, static-dynamic and functional balance exercises are performed mimicking normal movements. They are performed very slowly to facilitate memorisation through repetition, following the action-repetition principle of rehabilitative medicine, always taking care to make the patient always adopt a correct postural and motory pattern. Thus, during the working session postural errors are continuously corrected and neurophysiological responses are activated by following simple and instinctual postural and motory patterns (sit/stand up). Several working phases can be identified: a phase in which the dog lies on one side, another in which the dog is sitting in a ''sphinx'' or a ''sit dog'' position, another in which it stands on all fours, and a locomotion phase.",

It is organised as a non profit organization with the support of the fees from veterinary practitioners (about 650 adherents) and an executive board which defines the orientation and means of the center. It works in conjunction with the Center of Veterinary Pharmacovigilance and the Laboratory of Toxicological Analyses in the frame of the Unit of Pharmacy-Toxicology of the Veterinary School of Lyon. Since year 2000, the questions related to veterinary drugs (ADRs Adverse Drug Reactions) are dealt with by the Center of Veterinary Pharmacovigilance in the frame of the national system coordinated by the French Agency of Food Sanitary Security (AFSSA)",

            "text": "Such a context is worsened further by a local anomaly: the existence of 13 Vet faculties as recorded 1997/98, has been raised to 14 with the Udine Faculty (although this is not eligible to confer the formal university degree, but this is currently compensated by the Catanzaro Faculty) correspond to 20% of all European Faculties. Furthermore, these match the total number of faculties in Slovenia, Slovakia, Norway, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Sweden, the Netherlands, Ireland, Finland, Austria, Greece and half of France. The total number of Italian students constitutes the 26.6% of all European students. Currently, in fact, one out of six European Vets is Italian.Considering the Catanzaro case, if we consider (as we do) that the free circulation of professionals is based on similar educational pathways, the 14th Vet Graduation Course held at the Faculty of Human Medicine c/o Magna Graecia University in Catanzaro can neither be explained nor justified.MIUR (Italian Ministry of University and Research) communications, which in 2001 aimed to reassure that it was impossible to approve the new course due to ''an overall lack of necessary resources, as indicated by the Communitary Law for additional initiatives'', were confirmed -in 2002 -by the European Vet Medicine Association Report, stating a ''negative feedback to the Catanzaro initiative''. This negative feedback was also supported by the Conference of the Italian Vet Medicine Faculty Deans in 2001, which declined the activation of new Class (47/S) of Graduation Courses. Considering all the negative indications mentioned above, we certainly did not expect the surprising advice given by the National University System Evaluation Committee.",

In fact, autoimmune encephalitis occurred during clinical immunization trials with b-amyloid performed on Alzheimer's disease patients; for this reason, the trials were interrupted. We can conclude that the immunization can only induce a certain rate of resistance to experimental infection if the infection is performed via the intraperitoneal route, which is more comparable to natural infection. The more effective immunogens in this experiment comprise the prion protein sequence probably involved in the PrPres conversion process. Immunization performed using the described protocols is to be considered protective as it can delay the onset of the symptoms and the death of the animals, but it cannot stop the disease.Plasma TM levels were measured in 38 animals: 24 dogs naturally infected by L eismania infantum (none of the animals had ever undergone any specific anti-Leishmania therapy) and 14 healthy dogs (control group). Sick dogs were divided into two groups on the basis of the clinical examination . The first group comprised 10 oligo-symptomatic dogs while the second group comprised 14 symptomatic or markedly symptomatic dogs. The clinical diagnosis was always confirmed by direct observation of the protozoan in Giemsa stained fine needle aspirates of bone marrow and lymph nodes, and serologically using the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). The threshold titre for positivity was 1/160. A full blood count and measurement of total plasma proteins (TP), serum protein electrophoresis, alanine transaminase (ALT), creatinine and urea serum levels were obtained for each dog. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen were also determined using a semi-automatic coagulometer. TM concentration in the plasma was measured using ELISA with a commercially available kit (American Diagnostic Inc., USA). Mean values with their standard deviations were calculated from the data obtained and were then statistically evaluated using one-way analysis of variance. Significant results were subjected to the Student-Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparisons Test.",

            "text": "Plasma TM levels were significantly higher for dogs with leishmaniasis, especially those with severe clinical signs (Group II). In this study a significant relationship between high plasma TM levels and beta and gamma globulins plasma levels was observed. These elevated concentrations of gamma-globulins can be explained as a polyclonal response of B lymphocytes. These antibodies are not all directed against Leishmania but also reflect an autoimmune reaction. Deposition of circulating immuno-complexes (type III hypersensitivity) in blood vessels of different organs such 329 as those of the liver, spleen, skin, kidney, etc cause diffuse microvasculites and consequently, damage to the endothelium. The skin, ocular and haemopoietic involvement observed for animals of the second group is suggestive of an immunomediated process of the vessels with endothelial damage and TM increase. In agreement with Kumada et al. (1988) , the increase of ALT in the second group suggests a decrease in hepatic clearance and, consequently, an increase in plasma TM levels. In human internal medicine, high levels of TM have also been reported for the thromboembolic condition and for renal failure which have also been reported for canine leishmaniasis (Font et al., 1993; . However, in our research, the basal levels of PT, APTT, fibrinogen, urea and creatinine excluded renal failure and/or hemocoagulopathy. In conclusion, despite the low number of dogs used, our results suggest that plasma thrombomodulin can also be used as a non-invasive marker for endothelial injury in dogs as well as in humans. Further studies, including immunohistochemistry and the value of other endothelium markers, are needed to assess the role 330 played by TM in the genesis of endothelial lesions in dogs suffering from physiological and pathological conditions. different affinities for the membrane receptors: ADP agonist interacts with the GPIIb/IIIa membrane receptor, while collagen fastens especially to the GPIa/IIa membrane receptor. It is possible that the parasite causes direct damage to the different platelet membrane receptors which cannot then be recognised as ''self '' and consequently activate the immune-mediated process. Recently Dominguez and Torano (2001) have demonstrated that in the first phases of infection L eishmania is able to interact directly with the platelets by a specific mechanism termed ''immune adherence'', with the formation of large aggregates. Our data suggest that in dogs with severe clinical symptoms there is involvement of the intrinsic pathway as demonstrated by the prolonged APTT levels. This involvement could be due to a reduction in synthesis together with an increase in consumption of one or more clotting factors following hepatic damage and the chronic inflammatory state. Similar results were reported by Moreno (1999) for 26 dogs with Leishmaniasis although this author has not related his results to clinical conditions. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that in natural CanL primary and secondary haemostatic alterations are related to the severity of clinical symptoms. Collagen agonist could be used as a non-invasive first choice marker for the evaluation of platelet aggregation in a L eishmania infection. 334 In animals with very severe clinical conditions, the compromised immune state, the chronic inflammatory condition and the progressive liver and renal damage influence platelet function and the synthesis and metabolism of the clotting factors and can cause future bleeding disorders.",

            "text": "The bibliography regarding reptilias anaesthesia and especially the green iguana is poor. However, according to many authors (Heard et al., 2002; Mazzi, 2000; Nevarez et al., 2002) inhalation agents are the best in spite of the limitations caused by voluntary apnoea, even if some prefer direct intubation without a pharmacological preventive treatment. Injectable anaesthetics have some counter indications (longer induction and recovery, less muscle relaxation etc.). It was possible to use Z with posologies indicated by other authors (Addis et al., 1990; Barten, 1993) but lower than those reported by Mazzi (2000) . This anaesthetic allows a quicker induction and the presence of benzodiazepine gives the muscle relaxation required for handling and orotracheal intubation. No other analgesic is needed as Nevarez et al. (2002) suggest, because cyclohexamine provides sufficient action during diagnostic and surgical procedures. Using Zoletil i.m. in the cranial dorsal muscles there is no dosage problem related to 353 the presence of the renal portal circle and its use is easier than that of other anaesthetics which require an i.v. or intraosseous injection (Bennet et al., 1998) . The heart rate increase caused by cyclohexamine is useful to avoid bradycardia, a very common side effect when using propofol (Bennet et al., 1998) . Cyclohexamine also prevents side effects caused by the use of propofol. Zoletil did not cause either inducted apnoea or hypoxia. Orotracheal intubation allows use of a lower concentration of Isoflurane than in anaesthetic chambers or under maintenance using a mask (Addis et al., 1990; Barten, 1993) . Long recovery times are necessary, not 12 h as Mazzi (2000) because of Ketamine.Use of Zoletil does not cause excessive excitement in the green iguana, not similarly to effects noted for mammals and birds. These experiences show that this anaesthetic method is valid for anaesthesia of the green iguana. Differences in the mean systolic and diastolic pressure observed between pathological groups and the control group for the dog measurement using the oscillometric technique as an easy and reliable diagnostic tool, especially for some common diseases of the dog.",

In the reported cases PPID was suspected at the time of the 380 visit due to the presence of most of the classical clinical signs of the disease. The definitive diagnosis was strongly supported by the increased ACTH plasma concentration found above >35 pg/ml which is recognised as the critical value with a sensitivity of 100% (Perkins et al., 2002) .In contrast with the ACTH-stimulation test and dexamethasone suppression test, only a single blood sample is necessary to measure the basal ACTH concentration, which seems to be more practical and time saving.Pergolide mesylate treatment was successful for both horses and no side effects were noticed even though anorexia, sweating, dyspnoea, dry mouth, diarrhoea, colic and laminitis are reported as a consequence of higher doses of this drug (Beech, 1999; Munoz et al., 1996; Van der Kolk et al., 1997) . Furthermore, the restoration of fertility in ''case 1'' permitted successful use of the mare as embryo donor. In both cases the improvement of clinical signs seemed to be associated with reduced levels of ACTH plasma concentration that for the ''case 1'' mare returned within the normal range.In conclusion, the ACTH chemiluminescent immunoassay provides a good opportunity for veterinarians to confirm the suspicion of PPID and pergolide is the first drug of choice for its treatment, especially considering that only 1-4 tablets/day have to be given.",
