Although legionella and pneumococcal antigen testing kits are now available and have considerably greater sensitivity than blood or sputum cultures, their routine use in patients at low risk is felt not to be cost effective. The extent of microbiological investigations in patients with nonsevere CAP should be guided by clinical and epidemiological factors and by the response to previous antibiotic therapy. 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae is the major cause of CAP, accounting for over a third of cases in the community. Mycoplasma pneumoniae exhibits periodicity, with epidemics every four to five years, and mainly affects younger individuals. Influenza virus, along with a number of other viruses, contributes a sizeable proportion of cases (13 per cent). Other causes of CAP include Haemophilus influenzae (10 per cent), Legionella pneumophila, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydia species and Staphylococcus aureus, especially when influenza co-exists in the community. 2 More unusual forms of pneumonia to consider are Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with HIV and other forms of immunosuppression -much less frequently seen these days because of the use of prophylactic co-trimoxazole -TB in those with a more chronic pneumonia, and rare fungal and bacterial forms of pneumonia in those who have travelled. We need to remain alert to emerging causes of pneumonia such as avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). These should be considered in all patients presenting with a fever, cough or shortness of breath who have a relevant travel or contact histor y. 3, 4 Infection control issues will need to be addressed in these patients and an expert should be consulted in cases fitting the diagnostic criteria.",

            "text": "Pneumonia in children has a slightly different epidemiological pattern. Neonates may develop pneumonia from organisms acquired from the mother's genital tract such as Group B Streptococcus, Gram-negative organisms and Chlamydia. These children will usually be admitted to hospital for treatment. In one-month-to four-year-old children, most pneumonias are viral in origin and will not require antibiotics. Bacterial pneumonias in this age group are predominantly due to Strep. pneumoniae, whereas in the over-fours Strep. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae are the most frequently isolated organisms. 5 Resistance Concerns exist over the growing number of resistant bacteria, in particular Strep. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA). Penicillin-resistant Strep. pneumoniae is of concern, especially as resistance is frequently linked to macrolide resistance. Penicillin resistance in Strep. pneumoniae varies widely between countries, communities and groups of patients within those communities. In the UK in the year 2000, the rate of penicillin resistance was around 7 per cent but with a range of 4-13 per cent. Erythromycin resistance had a range of 10-22 per cent. Resistance of H. influenzae to ampicillin -mainly due to beta-lactamase production -is around 20 per cent in the UK. 6 Treatment Empirical treatment in the community is based on the fact that Strep. pneumoniae remains the leading cause of CAP. Prudent use of antibiotics is important in order to treat infections appropriately to curb the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance and to minimise side-effects and maximise compliance. Once a decision is made to treat, local resistance patterns must be taken into account.",

Note, however, that the latest BTS guidelines recommend adequate dosing with amoxicillin (500mg-1g three times daily) to cover intermediate-resistant strains. 2 Erythromycin is the second-line agent of choice if there are contraindications to amoxicillin or the patient fails to tolerate it.

Influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce hospital admissions, death rates from pneumonia and flu, prevent pneumonia and decrease outpatient visits for all respiratory conditions in over-65s and patients with chronic lung disease. Vaccination should be offered to all those in high-risk groups -including institutionalised individuals -on an annual basis. Influenza vaccine is contraindicated in those severely allergic to eggs. 10 In at-risk persons of 13 years or older who have not been vaccinated, and in institutionalised individuals, when influenza A or B is known to be circulating in the community, oseltamivir may be used for postexposure prophylaxis within 48 hours of exposure. 3 Pneumococcal vaccine should also be offered to selected individuals. The current 23-valent vaccine (Pneumovax II) includes serotypes responsible for 96 per cent of bacteraemic infections in the UK. It is recommended by the DoH for all persons over two years of age in whom pneumococcal infection is more common or more dangerous. This includes individuals with asplenia or functional asplenia (eg sickle-cell disease, coeliac disease), chronic renal, heart, lung and liver disease, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency and immunosuppression. It is contraindicated in acute infection and in pregnancy. 10, 11 The conjugate vaccine (Prevenar) has increased immunogenicity in infants, and is being introduced into the routine immunisation programme (see The Green Book). 10 There are no plans for the widespread introduction of the conjugate vaccine in the over-60s as yet.",

In the lowerrisk groups narrower-spectrum antibiotics can be used first line, whereas for those in whom failure of antibiotic therapy could have serious consequences, treatment should be directed against resistant organisms. 15 Forum imately 90 per cent) produce beta-lactamases and are subsequently resistant to beta-lactams, so in cases where antibiotics are indicated local sensitivity patterns must be taken into account (see Table 5 ). Since most H. influenzae are resistant to erythromycin and other macrolides, these are not recommended for treatment of exacerbations unless Chlamydia or Mycoplasma are suspected. Patients who experience frequent exacerbations are more likely to have resistant organisms and may require broad-spectrum antibiotics. Recommendations regarding other aspects of patient management, eg indications for steroids or bronchodilators, can be found in the PRODIGY guidelines on chest infections. 5",
