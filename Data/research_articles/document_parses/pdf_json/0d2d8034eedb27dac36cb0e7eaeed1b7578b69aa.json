The high prevalence of COVID-19 is a result of a lack of symptoms at onset. Our study aimed to present an overview of the virus in terms of structure, epidemiology, symptoms, treatment and prevention. Whole genome sequences and some viral proteins were investigated to determine gaps and changes in alternation of nucleotides and amino acid sequences. We evaluate 11 complete genome sequences of different coronaviruses using BAST and MAFFT software. We also selected seven types of structural proteins. We conclude that COVID-19 might produce new mutations, specifically in glycoproteins, so caution and complete preparation by health authorities is required.",

COVID-19 is classified as the seventh member of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae under the family Coronaviridae. Most members of this family are zoonotic viruses transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals. Although bats and snakes are the natural reservoir of most coronaviruses, there is no evidence so far that COVID-19 originated in or was transmitted from a seafood market [1] . Comparison of the lipid rafts of coronaviruses has indicated that the new strain COVID-19 has 80% identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Lipid molecules such as caveolins, clathrins and dynamin have a fundamental role in the internalization of viruses. These molecules are involved in the entry of viruses into host cells, and targeting host lipids is being studied as an antiviral strategy and could have various applications [2] . COVID-19 seems to need to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor on the membrane host cell to enable it to infect the host cell upon coupled with a reliance of serine protease TMPRSS2. This intracellular protein seems to be a determinant of the virus ability to infect the cell [3] .",

The WHO considers COVID-19 to be a more serious and widespread epidemic disease [4] . To date, it seems that the mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than those of SARS or MERS. A significant increase in number of COVID-19 cases was observed as the result of the absence of emerging pathological symptoms in virus carriers. For this reason, it may lead to the collapse of local health-care systems [4] . Some countries face an outbreak crisis and are trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through preventing human gatherings, imposing a curfew in cities, preventing travel between countries and closing land borders, all of which may reduce the outbreaks.",

Supportive treatment is needed for those with severe COVID-19. Specific attention should be given to and more efforts made to reduce transmission to susceptible populations, including health-care providers, immunocompromised patients, children and the elderly [5] . Health-care systems around the world must operate with more than one maximum capacity. Cooperation between health-care systems and the WHO is required to reduce infection. International media, social media and societal culture should be used to maintain personal cleaning, minimize risk of exposure, avoid gatherings and prevent all phenomena that lead to contact between persons [12] .
