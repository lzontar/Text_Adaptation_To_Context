The qualitative analysis revealed 26 clinical studies, from which six disorders, i.e., RA, SSc, SS, SLE, AS, and BD, were included in the review. In accordance to the World Dental Federation (FDI) definition of oral health as a synthesis of physical and psychological well-being with regard to the orofacial system [35] , the OHRQoL plays an indispensable role in dental care. The concept of OHRQoL enables a shift from the pure physical consideration of the patients with a focus restricted to the haptic presence of oral diseases to a comprehensive patient-centered assessment [4, 36] . Thereby, OHRQoL must be seen as a mandatory sub-aspect of general HRQoL, including the possible interrelationship between orofacial health and general HRQoL in a complex interaction [3, 4, 36] . Accordingly, the assessment of OHRQoL in the context of oral-health-and disease-related parameters in patients with rheumatic diseases appears to be contemporary and reasonable. However, rheumatic diseases constitute a heterogeneous group of different disorders with manifold therapeutic strategies [1] , making comparison and interpretation difficult. Moreover, the inconsistency of included studies regarding their study design, patient selection criteria, methodology, and geographical specifics has an impact on their comparability. Nevertheless, the results of this systematic review can provide some interesting information for the interdisciplinary dental care of patients with rheumatic diseases. Moreover, recommendations for future research in the field can be formulated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 408, "end": 412, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 672, "end": 675, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 676, "end": 679, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 864, "end": 867, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 868, "end": 870, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 871, "end": 874, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1179, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Generally a reduced OHRQoL is apparent in patients with rheumatic disease. A total of 15 studies reported the OHRQoL in comparison with a healthy control group, of which 14 studies found worse results in patients suffering from rheumatic diseases [8, [11] [12] [13] 15, 16, 21, 22, 24, 26, 30, 31, 33, 34] . The valid interpretation of further results is difficult. Reference values for generally healthy individuals can help to provide a statement as to whether results represent a deficit in the OHRQoL of the patients. Due to cultural differences as well as a large influence of age, sex, and the presence of teeth/prosthodontic treatment on OHRQoL outcome [37, 38] , consistent international reference values are not available. For instance, the German dentate general population exhibits a sum score of OHIP 14 of 0-4 or OHIP 49 between 5 and 15 points depending on full or partial dentition [38, 39] . The comparability is limited due to different countries with particularities potentially affecting OHRQoL [37] . Irrespective of this fact, the OHIP values of all included studies with patients suffering from rheumatic diseases were higher than these reference values. Within the studies that applied the OHIP questionnaire to patients with rheumatic diseases, SS and BD in particular showed the highest OHIP scores, representing a reduced OHRQoL (Figures 2 and 3) . SS is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the exocrine glands, what leads to a dryness of mouth and eyes due to involvement of salivary and lacrimal glands, respectively [40] . The resulting xerostomia is a complex condition, leading to remarkable impairment of OHRQoL [41] . Accordingly, majority of included studies dealing with SS showed associations between worse OHRQoL and salivary flow or composition [8, [24] [25] [26] 28] . One study that examined RA also investigated the influence of xerostomia on OHRQoL and was also able to show a negative impact [14] . The disease-related xerostomia in patients with SS might therefore be a major reason for their impaired OHRQoL. Similarly, BD represents a chronic multisystem disease with a special disease-related condition affecting the oral cavity: oral ulcers [42] . This painful efflorescence of oral soft tissues constitutes a logical reason for their impaired OHRQoL. This was confirmed by the negative effect of active ulcers on OHRQoL in the included studies [30] [31] [32] [33] . Therefore, rheumatic diseases leading to a primarily oral manifestation appear to have the largest impact on OHRQoL among the included investigations. In this context, the relationship between periodontaitis and rheumatic diseases, especially RA, needs to be mentioned [43] . Although RA is related to a higher prevalence and increased severity of periodontitis [6] , this appears to have no remarkable effect on patients' OHRQoL, because none of the included studies reported associations between periodontitis and OHRQoL explicitly ( Table 2 ). Within the oral conditions, only the presence of missing/extracted teeth and/or wearing dentures was repeatedly reported to affect OHRQoL [9, 14, 17, 30, 32, 34] . It appears evident that tooth loss can be seen as a factor influential on OHRQoL, independently of the applied instrument for measurement or included patients [44] . Accordingly, this finding appears not to be specific for rheumatic diseases. However, the higher risk for tooth loss in rheumatic diseases, especially RA, due to the relationship to periodontal burden should be recognized in this context [45] . Considering both the influence of tooth loss on OHRQoL in general [44] and the high prevalence of tooth loss in rheumatic disease [6, 45] , this is an important issue. On one hand, the avoidance of tooth loss might be of increasing relevance for these patients to reduce the impairment of their OHRQoL. On the other hand, tooth loss or denture wearing should be assessed and considered in studies dealing with the OHRQoL of patients suffering from rheumatic diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 247, "end": 250, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 251, "end": 255, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 256, "end": 260, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 261, "end": 265, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 266, "end": 269, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 270, "end": 273, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 274, "end": 277, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 278, "end": 281, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 290, "end": 293, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 294, "end": 297, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 298, "end": 301, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 302, "end": 305, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 660, "end": 664, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 665, "end": 668, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 897, "end": 901, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 902, "end": 905, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1018, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1565, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1664, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1799, "end": 1802, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1803, "end": 1807, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1812, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1817, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1821, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1951, "end": 1955, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2205, "end": 2209, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2409, "end": 2413, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2414, "end": 2418, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2419, "end": 2423, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2424, "end": 2428, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2700, "end": 2704, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2793, "end": 2796, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3116, "end": 3119, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3120, "end": 3123, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3124, "end": 3127, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3128, "end": 3131, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3132, "end": 3135, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3136, "end": 3139, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3301, "end": 3305, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3546, "end": 3550, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 3619, "end": 3623, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3683, "end": 3686, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3687, "end": 3690, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1355, "end": 1372, "text": "(Figures 2 and 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2967, "end": 2974, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another issue touched on by this systematic review is the occurrence of associations between general HRQoL and/or rheumatic-disease-related parameters with OHRQoL. As presented in Table 2 , results regarding this issue are heterogeneous and only a small number of studies also examined HRQoL. For generally healthy individuals, a relationship between OHRQoL and general HRQoL is documented in literature, whereby OHRQoL is more strongly related to physical oral health than to general HRQoL [4, 36] . However, patients with rheumatic diseases often show reduced HRQoL due to their disease burden, pain, anxiety, or depression [2] . Therefore, the interrelation between OHRQoL and general HRQoL is of interest in these patient groups. The majority of included studies (5/6) that examined this relationship found associations, whereby different measurements for HRQoL were applied [8, 9, 15, 21, 22] . Two potential explanations might be conceivable for this finding. On one hand, the oral conditions related to rheumatic diseases might have an influence on both OHRQoL and general HRQoL in these patients. Based on the literature, this seems conceivable [4, 36] , but because none of the studies explicitly examined this issue, this remains speculative. The second potential explanation could be the effect of rheumatic disease on whole HRQoL, including OHRQoL, due to the physical and psychosocial impairment of patients caused by the underlying disease. Accordingly, the impaired OHRQoL of these patients would be more strongly affected by rheumatic disease burden than by their oral conditions. To support this hypothesis, the associations between OHRQoL and rheumatic-disease-related parameters were examined. The majority of studies that examined this issue (16/21) were able to confirm a relationship between OHRQoL and disease-related parameters [8, [12] [13] [14] 16, 17, 22, [24] [25] [26] 28, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] .

Because five studies did not compare subscales to a healthy control [14, 17, 28, 29, 32] , and different subscales were applied, the comparability is limited. However, some interesting information can be derived from the findings: In the vast majority of studies with a control group (5/6), a significant effect of the subscale \"physical disability\" was confirmed without any predominant manifestation in one of the included diseases [8, 11, 20, 30, 34] . Furthermore, half of examinations (3/6) also confirmed a significant impairment of the psychosocial and/or psychological sub-aspects of OHRQoL [8, 20, 31] . Moreover, the potential relevance of psychosocial patterns is highlighted by two special results. In a randomized clinical trial, the effect of malic acid on OHRQoL of patients with SS was tested. The largest improvement was recorded for psychological pattern [29] . Another study in patients with RA found correlations between disease activity and the pattern of psychosocial impact [17] . Rheumatic diseases constitute an important psychosocial impairment [48] . Accordingly, the relevance of psychological and/or psychosocial issues in the context of OHRQoL might be of clinical relevance. It is therefore conceivable that beside impaired physical oral health due to related manifestations like xerostomia or oral ulcers, a psychosocial impairment caused by rheumatic disease burden might be responsible for the impaired OHRQoL of these patients. This condition might be of particular relevance, because a solely physical understanding might be inadequate for their dental care. In fact, this rather argues for a patient-centered, individual, and multidisciplinary care model [49] , which must also be implemented in the dental care of patients with rheumatic diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 156, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 157, "end": 160, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 161, "end": 164, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 165, "end": 168, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 169, "end": 172, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 518, "end": 521, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 522, "end": 525, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 526, "end": 529, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 530, "end": 533, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 534, "end": 537, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 683, "end": 686, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 687, "end": 690, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 691, "end": 694, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 957, "end": 961, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1085, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1159, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1780, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another issue of relevance is the methodology applied in the included studies. A total of six different questionnaires, including OHIP 49, OHIP 14, GOHAI, MHISS, XeQoL, and a specific OHRQoL questionnaire, were used. The OHIP and GOHAI questionnaires appear to be valid and reliable assessment measures for OHRQoL [5] . The available examinations showed appropriate validity for the applied questionnaires, and the majority of available information was provided for OHIP questionnaire [19, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Only one study concluded OHIP 49 to be not precise and sensitive for patients with SSc and disease-specific questionnaires to be needed [19] . While a strong conclusion as to the most appropriate measurement tool is not possible based on the available studies, several consideration can be highlighted. The use of the OHIP questionnaire can be especially recommended for rheumatic diseases with oral manifestations because of its appropriate psychometric properties, especially in case of xerostomia [50] . This was confirmed by the results for SS and BD in the included studies. For rheumatic diseases like SSc with a lower number of oral manifestations, disease-specific questionnaires like the MHISS might be more informative and suitable [10, 21] . However, for these diseases, the OHIP questionnaire, reporting mean value, standard deviation, and median are also recommended to ensure comparability with available literature. Furthermore, reference values for interpretation of OHRQoL results are recommended [38] . Therefore, future studies might focus on the evaluation of these references for rheumatic-diseased individuals. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of detected differences like OHIP scores must be considered. Interventional studies especially focus on minimal important difference as a reference for a noticeable clinical effect [51] . These values are available for systemically healthy but not rheumatic-diseased individuals, making investigations regarding this issue recommendable.
