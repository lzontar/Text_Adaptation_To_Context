Zimmerman 1995; Cattaneo and Chapman 2010) . Camacho et al. (2014:294) , while citing previous research, describe empowerment as \"strategies or mechanisms that equip people with sufficient knowledge and autonomy to allow them to exert control over a certain decision\". Similarly, it has been noted in the marketing literature that \"empowerment requires mechanisms for individuals to gain control over issues that concern them, including opportunities to develop and practice skills necessary to exert control over their decision making\" (Pires et al. 2006, p. 938) . In light of previous discussions and among them Broniarczyk and Griffin (2014) , Kucuk (2009), and Pires et al. (2006) , the current investigation argues that this paradigm can help us gain understanding into the perceived use of price comparison websites and eSwitching behaviour in particular among existing shoppers. In general, the internet equips users with the tool to gain access to credible and quality information and this by implication confers more power and freedom of choice to users and in this case online shoppers. Moreover, since it is known that customers often rely on expert advice (in this instance, price comparison websites) when making purchase decisions (Camacho et al. 2014 ), such advice -well-intentionedcan dramatically reduce switching cost. One of the benefits of comparison tools and in this case price comparison websites is that they offer shoppers a range of choices (Broniarczyk and Griffin 2014) , thus allowing shoppers to shop across stores. Online switching behaviour (or eSwitching) is considered to be a possible outcome of this process. Similarly, since it is has been suggested in the literature that digital ads may be an important source of consumer empowerment today (Hudders et al. 2019) , it is considered therefore to play an influential role in shoppers' behavioural tendencies to use price comparison websites and to consequently eSwitch.

In the context of this study, consumers might easily switch between online stores when it is believed they can get better price deals elsewhere. Price comparison websites lower the barriers to switching by offering such alternatives in one central place, with links that could easily navigate to said alternatives.

This novel finding in some ways mirrors the conclusion in past research about the role that searchintentions play in customers' channel switching (Gopta et al. 2004 ).

Shopper innovativeness had the greatest impact on eSwitching. Since it has been suggested that individuals who are more likely to experiment with new ideas and/or products are more prone to switching (Bhattacherjee et al. 2012; Xu et al. 2013 ) and perceived innovativeness of the services provider inhibits customer switching intentions (Malhotra and Malhotra 2013) , the study's finding, therefore, is a reinforcement to extant research.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 688, "end": 715, "text": "(Bhattacherjee et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 716, "end": 730, "text": "Xu et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 826, "end": 854, "text": "(Malhotra and Malhotra 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Short Discussion and Conclusion"}, {"text": "Because shoppers who possess a higher level of service experience conscientiousness than others may be more prone to service dissatisfaction, the finding, therefore, mirrors previous discussions about the role of customer dissatisfaction in customer switching behaviour (cf.

Furthermore, since the strength of relationships was never hypothesized, it is important therefore for future analysis to validate the assumption that shopper innovativeness, compared to others, has the strongest impact on online switching behaviour. Meanwhile, an important limitation of this analysis is that it was conducted using a student population and so makes it difficult to generalize beyond the target population. This consequently reinforces our call for further research on this topic.
