Next, we analyzed in silico whether pol and pre-terminal protein (pTP), both of which were related to viral DNA replication, were spliced from a common leader sequence that was predicted by sequence analysis in the previously reported adenoviruses [29] . In BtAdV-A and BtAdV-B, a 9 bp sequence including the initiation ATG codon supported the splicing of both the pol and pTP exons downstream. However, this 9 bp leader (ATGGCTTTG) of EhAdV 06-106 supported the splicing only to the pTP exon, but did not support splicing to the pol exon. The splicing of the pol mRNA using the predicted splicing donor and acceptor sites led to a stop codon. To confirm this, we extracted RNA from the EhAdV 06-106-infected Vero E6 cells and analyzed the 5 end of the pol mRNA sequence. We obtained a non-spliced sequence, demonstrating that splicing did not occur in EhAdV 06-106.

However, group 3 includes viruses of bats from two families Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae (Table 1) . These latter families are of two different suborders (Microchiroptera and Megachiroptera, respectively).

In contrast, Atadenovirus and Siadenovirus were adopted as newer genera on the basis of the genome organization and characteristics of coding proteins, and viruses belonging to these genera have been detected in a relatively wide range of host species [6, 34] . For example, Atadenovirus is so named because of the high A + T content in its genome, and its hosts include cattle, ducks, goats, possums and different squamate reptiles including snakes and lizards. Since the adenoviruses found in reptiles have equilibrated base composition, it has been hypothesized that the ancestral reptile adenovirus might have jumped to certain avian and mammalian hosts, where they further evolved [28, 35] .

Because high DNA copy numbers of a group 1 bat adenovirus (i.e., BtAdV-B) were detected in the intestine of the infected P. pipistrellus bats [16, 18] , it might also be interesting to use other organs (e.g., intestine) to isolate bat adenoviruses from E. helvum bats.
