In this study, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays for the detection and differentiation of different US PEDV variants were developed based on the differences in the S1 domain of the spike (S) gene. This assay successfully differentiated three PEDV strains: PC22A (the original US virulent), Iowa106 (S-INDEL), and PC177 (S-197DEL) that was derived from cell culture adaptation and has a 197 amino acid-deletion in the S1 domain. The assays did not amplify the porcine deltacoronavirus OH-FD22 strain or transmissible gastroenteritis virus Miller strain. It is the first report on the development of RT-PCR assays allowing the detection and differentiation of all major types of US PEDV variants.",

To date, many techniques have been developed to detect PEDV strains, including conventional RT-PCR (Ishikawa et al., 1997) , real-time RT-PCR (Wang et al., 2014b) , immunofluorescence (IF) tests (Debouck et al., 1981) , immunohistochemical techniques (Guscetti et al., 1998) , immunoelectron microscopy (Pensaert and De Bouck, 1978) , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and a nanoparticle-assisted PCR assay (Yuan et al., 2015) . However, all of these techniques can detect and differentiate only one or two types of PEDV strains. Therefore, a method that can simultaneously detect the three types of PEDV strains is urgently needed. In this study, we developed simple and economic RT-PCR assays for the detection and differentiation of different US PEDV strains.",

In this study, the specificity of the primer pairs was evaluated using the cell culture supernatants of three types of US PEDV strains and two other porcine coronaviruses (TGEV and PDCoV). We found that our assays were specific for the PEDV strains. A previous study showed that the sensitivity of conventional RT-PCR was 10 4 TCID 50 /mL (Kweon et al., 1997) . In this study, the detection limits of the primary PCR assays for strain PC177, PC22A and Iowa106 varied. In general, nested PCR could increase the sensitivity about 100-1000 fold (Cowley et al., 2004) . It was our observation that the sensitivity of the nested PCR assays for the detection of PC22A (primary and the secondary PCR assays with primer sets F1/UR and F2/UR, respectively) and Iowa106 (primary and the secondary PCR assays with primer sets F1/UR and F3/UR, respectively) was much higher than the primary PCR with primer set F1/UR (for both strains) or the strain-specific primer sets (F2/UR for PC22A, and F3/UR for PC177) (data not shown). A total of 12 clinical fecal and intestinal samples (9 US original and 3 S-INDEL PEDV strains) were tested by these assays and the PCR products were sequenced to verify the specificity. We found that these assays were strain-specific (data not shown).",
