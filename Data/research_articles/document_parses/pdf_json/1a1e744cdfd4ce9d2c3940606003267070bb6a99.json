The long-term psychological impact, of both the spread of the virus and the restrictive policies adopted to counteract it, remains uncertain. However, recent studies reported a high level of psychological distress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The purpose of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of a new questionnaire, to evaluate PTSD risk related to the COVID-19 emergency. A total of Italian people completed a web-based cross-sectional survey broadcasted through different social-media. Demographic data and some psychological dimensions, such as general distress and sleep disturbance, were collected. A new self-report questionnaire (COVID-19-PTSD), consisting of 19 items, was developed starting from the PTSD Check List for DSM-5 (PCL-5) questionnaire, and it was administered in order to analyze its psychometric properties. The results highlighted the adequate psychometric properties of the COVID-19-PTSD questionnaire. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a seven-factor model adopted to counteract the spread of infection may have been perceived as traumatic events [7] . Consequently, they can represent risk factors for many mental diseases [8] , and they can potentially generate Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1246, "end": 1249, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1326, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1413, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "PTSD is a psychiatric disorder caused by a terrifying event, perceived as a trauma, which affects directly or indirectly the individual (e.g., severe accident or injury, threat to physical safety, death or threat death, sexual assault, natural disasters, war, etc.) [9] .

The prevalence of PTSD, considering this cut-off score, was reported at around 29%. At the first examination, this percentage might seem high. However, different hypotheses can be carried out. Firstly, the data were collected in March 2020, during the peak of infection and death due to COVID-19 in Italy [46] , characterized by a high overload of the national health system and the restriction measures adopted by the Italian Government, i.e., a phase that can be considered as a highly acute stressor. Secondly, the specific request to focus on issues related to COVID-19 may have emphasized the results associated with the perception of personal distress, representing a psychological demand from respondents, who experienced for the first time this pandemic, to perceive it as highly traumatic. In this light, the COVID-19-PTSD questionnaire could be considered a sensitive screening tool in a population faced with emergencies, and it can represent a first step toward the assessment of the risk of PTSD.

Another limit is represented by the absence of a test-retest analysis, considering a translation of the classic version of the PCL-5 not directly referred to the COVID-19 experience. A similar evaluation could help us in determining similarities and differences between the two questionnaires, allowing us to confirm what assessment represents the better choice in this emergency. Moreover, despite the large sample size, it is not possible to overcome the limitations of a cross-sectional online study, such as the selection bias of participants' recruitment and the absence of a longitudinal control aimed to identify the real risk of the PTSD occurrence. This bias is expressed by the higher number of respondents younger than 30 years of age, and the higher number of females and people from South Italy. Finally, it could be useful to replicate these results in a clinical sample. Furthermore, it could be helpful in other studies to perform multilevel analyses (e.g., considering age, gender or geographical location) to differentiate PTSD symptoms.
