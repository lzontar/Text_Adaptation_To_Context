Many \"structured models\" capture aspects of the contact structure through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An important observation in unstructured models of a disease that confers immunity, is that once a fraction 1 \u2212 1/R 0 has been infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an epidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold can be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because the disease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunizing higher-risk individuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited \"first wave\" may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a second wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we systematically analyse a number of well-known mean-field models for networks and other structured populations to shed further light on some important questions relevant to the current COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we consider the question of herd-immunity under several scenarios. When modelling interventions as changes in transmission rates, we confirm that in networks with significant degree heterogeneity, the first wave of the epidemic confers herd-immunity with significantly fewer infections than equivalent models with less or no degree heterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in the contact network, then this effect might become much more subtle. Indeed, modifying the structure disproportionately can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during the first wave and therefore make the second wave more substantial. We strengthen this finding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with real data and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of the mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. Overall, * i.z.kiss@sussex.ac.uk 1 arXiv:2007.06975v1 [q-bio.PE] 14 Jul 2020 we find that results regarding (disease-induced) herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, the duration of the lockdown and how the lockdown is implemented in the model.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease COVID-19 has had worldwide impact.

This is because the initial wave of infections preferentially affects those most at risk. Thus it acts like a targeted vaccination, removing the people who are most likely to transmit infection from the susceptible pool. Generally, the time course of a real epidemic involves the following stages: (i) short period of unconstrained transmission, (ii) significant control or lockdown, and (iii) relaxation of control measures. Typically, during lockdown some spread persists and one pertinent question is whether relaxing the lockdown will lead to a second wave. In [3] , this question was explored by looking at prevalence at the end of lockdown in scenarios where lifting the lockdown did not lead to resurgence.

Modelling epidemics on networks and the analysis of the resulting systems, be they stochastic or deterministic, is a well studied research area [14, 23, 25] . The main reason for using networks is twofold. First, networks are intuitive and easy to understand and use, and second, they allow us to represent contact structure within a population to a high degree of accuracy. One of the most frequently studied questions in this area is how to understand and quantify the impact of various network properties on the invasion, spread and control of infectious diseases. Epidemics are usually modelled as stochastic process unfolding on the network. For example, the susceptible-infected-recovered/removed (SIR) epidemic on a network is modelled by the two separate processes: infection and recovery. In the simplest case both are Poisson processes such that an infectious node u connected to a susceptible node v transmits at per-contact rate \u03c4 , causing v to convert to infected.

Figure 3 shows results from the degree-based mean field model (left column) and heterogeneous pairwise model without clustering (right column) for networks with increasing levels of degree heterogeneity (from top to bottom). In each case, we find the optimal \u03b1 (a simple down scaling of the transmission rate without change to the network) and report the number of infections required to achieve DIHI (i.e., total of infected and recovered nodes at the end of lockdown such that the the epidemic after lockdown is subcritical). Several observations can be made. First, for both models, aggressive control (value of \u03b1) leads to a second wave. Equally, if the control is too weak (high value of \u03b1) the epidemic will still run its course during the first wave with some reduction in the final size. Hence, there is an optimal value of \u03b1 for which the final epidemic size is smallest and the epidemic post-lockdown is subcritical.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 679, "end": 687, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Contact heterogeneity and clustering"}, {"text": "Both models clearly show that DIHI decreases with variance.

To do so, we began by considering three scenarios described by [26] , namely, school closure, school closure and social distancing, and work distancing. In a baseline, no-intervention case, the matrix of daily contacts C was set to be the sum of 4 components: school contacts, work contacts, home contacts and other contacts. In what follows, we use the corresponding matrices of agebanded daily contacts in the UK produced by the POLYMOD study [26] . Briefly, school closure is realised by zeroing the school component of the mixing matrix); school closure and social distancing involved zeroing school contacts as well as reducing by half the number contacts at other locations between school-going individuals (first four age groups); work distancing is implemented by halving the contacts made at the workplace. For each of these interventions, we compared the behaviour of the system when re-scaling the matrix of total contacts so that its R 0 during the intervention was the same as the R 0 of the modified mixing matrix during the intervention (namely, 2.114, 2.106 and 2.179 for scenarios 1 to 3 respectively).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 371, "end": 375, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 753, "end": 757, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Scaling versus modulating the mixing matrix model"}, {"text": "Age-banded population counts (18 5-year bands) were taken from the Office for National Statistics (licensed under the Open Government Licence), pooling all age groups above 85.

These rates were calculated based on cases in China in the initial outbreak and from the closed population on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

In all cases, we used the same start date (T = 260) and duration (150 days) for the intervention. These parameters were arbitrarily chosen among the sets of possible parameters resulting in a sub-critical epidemic post-intervention. Figure 7 confirms that all interventions (coloured lines) result in a reduction in the number of infected individuals. However, whether this intervention is realised through modulating the contact matrix (solid lines) or through uniform scaling (dashed lines) results in substantially different outcomes (\u2248 16% differences for scenarios 1 and 2, \u2248 3% in scenario 3), even though the scaling factors used in the control interventions (dashed lines) are very similar from one scenario to the other. This is clear evidence that the structure of the contacts modulates the effects of the intervention. Figure 8 provides a visual intuition as to why the work distancing scenario is closest to simply scaling the matrix. As pointed out by [21] , assortative mixing dominates in 3 of the components (home, school, other). Thus, school closure primarily affects diagonal elements of the mixing matrix (and primarily for the first 4 age groups). Intervention 2 does involve halving (some of) the contacts in the other component and some of those terms diffuse away from the diagonal, however, these contribute little to the overall mixing matrix. In contrast, the work component is the only component to feature what Mossong et al. [21] describe as a wide contact plateau.

Whereas the former plays a key role in the calculation of the effective R 0 (see Section 2.6), the latter weights the impact of the intervention. For example, zeroing school contacts which only account for 12% of the total number of contacts will be negligible compared to zeroing other contacts that account for 40%. Therefore, in what follows, all age groups were set to have the same number of individuals (1/18-th of the total population) and all contact components were scaled to have the same sum of elements (arbitrarily, the sum of the original number of other contacts). We then systematically analysed the effect of three different interventions in which one component (school, work, or other was systematically scaled down by a factor taking values between 1.0 (no intervention) and 0.0 in steps of 0.1. Figure 9 shows the effect of the most severe form of intervention (the zeroing of the relevant component) and clearly demonstrates that, once confounding factors are removed, changes in the mixing matrix lead to different outcomes in terms of whether such an intervention is more or less effective than simply scaling the matrix to achieve the same effective R 0 . Here, zeroing the school component is less effective than scaling the overall matrix (despite an overall scaling factor of 0.61). Instead, zeroing either the work or other component is more effective than scaling the overall matrix (despite larger scaling factors, 0.87 and 0.88, respectively).
