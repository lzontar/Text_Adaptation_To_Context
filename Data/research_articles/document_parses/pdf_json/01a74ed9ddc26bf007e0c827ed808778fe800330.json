In setting policies, decision makers must weigh the operational needs of their business while against the possibility of an outbreak in the work environment. In addition to the analytical results that our model provides, simulation can further help ring-fence difficult decisions. Our model requires four parameters, the arrival rate of infectious interactions, the average number infected at each event, and two parameters which govern the communicable period's density function. We use the open literature [16] as a guide to fix the communicable period; we fix a = 4.4 days with b = 0.84; these parameter choices give a mean communicable period of 5.5 days with 97.5% of the communicable period ending in 11.5 days. In figure 2 , we show the density function arising from our parameter settings. The decision maker has control over the remaining two parameters. By limiting meeting sizes, restricting the number of employees interactions, and by mandating the use of personal protective equipment, the decision maker can set the variables controlling the arrival rate of infectious events and the number infected at each event. We treat the population as homogeneous, holding fixed the arrival rate for infections and the number infected per event over time. In a small setting, in reality, we expect that as people become infected the social network will change, even in the limit of an unmitigated outbreak. Those changes which will have an effect on the basic parameters of our branching model as the population becomes infected, but exactly how the network changes is a complicated phenomena.
