(1, 2) Patients presented with symptoms that included high fever, pneumonia, dyspnea, and respiratory failure. The causative agent was identified to be severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus variant 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the 7 th coronavirus strain to infect humans to date,(3) and the clinical syndrome was designated coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID19). The pathogenesis of COVID19 is similar to previously documented respiratory distress syndromes caused by related coronaviruses, including the 2005 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS).(4) However, the greater transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 has enabled a swift global spread that has resulted in substantial mortality. Detection and tracking SARS-CoV-2 spread has been difficult. Moreover, the spectrum of symptomatology observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection is wide, ranging from asymptomatic and mild, reminiscent of numerous seasonal infections, including influenza and common cold viruses, all the way to lifethreatening respiratory failure that requires intensive care and invasive ventilation. Currently, increased age and comorbidities are the factors most highly predictive of severe of COVID19 disease. (5) The utility of serological tests to identify individuals who have acquired antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is thus recognized as both an indication of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and, potentially, of immunity afforded to the seropositive individual. (3, (6) (7) (8) Seroconversion is determined by detection of antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Coronaviruses have 4 major structural proteins: spike (S) protein (including the S1 protein and receptor binding domain (RBD)), nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein and envelope (E) protein. (9) Previous studies of SARS-CoV and MERS found the most immunogenic antigens are the S-and N-proteins, (10) and development of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has focused heavily on these viral proteins.",

ELISAs offer wide flexibility for research laboratories to select virtually any antigen of interest and provide highly sensitive, quantitative results. HTSAs are more suitable for clinical laboratories and offer limited antigen diversity but allow high-throughput and sensitive, semi-quantitative results. LFAs also offer limited antigen diversity, but function with small volumes (~20\u00b5L) of whole blood, plasma or sera and allow rapid (\u00a315 minutes) results at the point of care. The clinical community will undoubtedly employ multiple SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms but a comparative analysis across platforms has not been undertaken. Further, it is currently unknown whether the detection of antibodies that bind these proteins predicts neutralizing activity or protection against infection. (11) Convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion has been recognized as a potential treatment for critically ill COVID19 patients and the New York Blood Center (NYBC) has led the first COVID19 CP donation program in the United States. Using 370 unique CP donor samples deposited in our COVID19 Research Repository (https://nybc.org/covid19repository), we conducted ELISA, HSTA and LFA assays as well as SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assays. We find that CP donors have a wide range of antibody titers measured across multiple COVID19 serological and neutralization assays. Notably, we show that some HTSA and ELISA assays predict neutralizing activity in vitro and may thus serve to predict antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.",

CP donors had a median age of 41 years (95% CI: 39-44, range 17-75 years,) and showed a gaussian distribution (n=183, r 2 =0\u00b789) compared to the national median age of 38\u00b72 years in 2018 ( Figure 1A) .

The frequency of ABORh blood group antigens was also largely consistent with the national frequency, with a slightly higher number of Aand Odonors and slightly lower number of AB + and B + donors than expected ( Figure 1C) . Finally, CP donor ethnicity was largely consistent with the national ethnic composition, with a slightly higher number of multiracial/other donors and lower number of Black/African American donors than expected ( Figure 1D) .

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such assays require in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities and highly trained personnel. To overcome this limitation and expedite testing, we employed pseudotyped virus assays based on either HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) or VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus). Both viruses were engineered to lack their own envelope glycoproteins and to express a luciferase reporter gene. Complementation in trans with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein, results in the generation of pseudotyped virus particles that are dependent on the interaction between the S protein and its receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) for entry into cells. (12) These reporter viruses were used to measure infection of human cells engineered to express ACE2 (HIV-S assay) or expressed endogenous ACE2 (VSV-S assay) and to determine the ability of plasma dilutions to inhibit S-dependent virus entry. The NT50 values, reflecting the plasma dilution at which virus infection is reduced by 50%, were calculated for each sample (Supplementary Figure 1A) .",

In the S1 ELISA, the median value for CP donor samples was 445\u00b5g/mL (n=285, 95% CI: 342 -536\u00b5g/mL, S/co = 120\u00b5g/mL) and for FFP controls 100\u00b79\u00b5g/mL (n=10, 95% CI: 78 -120\u00b5g/mL). In the NP ELISA the median value for CP donor samples was 6432\u00b5g/mL (n=271, 95% CI: 2811 -13792\u00b5g/mL, S/co = 700\u00b5g/mL) while in the RBD ELISA the median value of CP donor samples was 15\u00b76\u00b5g/mL (n=43, 95% CI: 12\u00b755 -25\u00b76\u00b5g/mL, S/co = 4\u00b5g/mL). Notably, the range of S1 and NP-binding antibody concentrations observed in the ELISAs was extreme, constituting a 1,000-fold difference in titers within the CP donor population. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CP donors have a wide range of concentrations of antibodies specific to immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 antigens, as measured across multiple serological platforms.",

Variation in the exposure of the adaptive immune system to SARS-CoV-2 antigen would, in turn, likely impact the magnitude of immune responses. Our observation that the levels of antibody to N, as well as S, correlates with S-specific neutralizing titer suggests that quantitative differences in the overall adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, rather than intrinsic differences in the ability of individuals to mount neutralizing responses, at least partly explains the large variation in neutralizing capacity of CP.

For CP donors where symptom dates were reported, the time between last symptom and the date of donation was calculated. Interestingly, CP donors 2-3 weeks post symptoms had a statistically significant increase in NT50 values compared to CP donors >3 weeks post-symptom (Figure 2F and Supplementary Figure 1H, n=52, p = 0\u00b703 and 0\u00b704, median difference 426 and 226, respectively). Overall, these data suggest CP donors possess a wide range of neutralizing antibody levels that are proportionately distributed across demographic categories with the exception of a small sex-dependent effect.Serological Test Results of the CP Donor PopulationMultiple platforms have been deployed to detect seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2. The simplest tests are LFAs, which solubilize antibodies from whole blood, plasma or sera in an aqueous mobile phase which moves across a nitrocellulose membrane coated with anti-human IgG and/or IgM to distinguish between specific classes of immunoglobins while a control band ensures test function. Binding of antibodies to antigen-conjugated enzyme, such as horseradish peroxidase, generates a colored band at the test lines. Analysis of 144 CP donor samples showed that only 79\u00b74% of CP donors tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specfic IgG antibodies and 24\u00b78%for IgM antibodies(Figure 3A, top). While LFAs are not designed to perform quantitatively, large discrepancies in band intensity between donors (Supplementary Figure 2A)is often presumed to indicate semi-quantitative results. We performed densitometric analysis of the test bands from LFA cassettes(Supplementary Figure 2B, 2C) and normalized each test to control band intensity. LFAs showed an intensity range of 0% -99\u00b72% for IgG bands and 0% -18\u00b75% for IgM bands, with a median intensity of 20% for IgG and <1% for IgM(Figure 3A, bottom). Thus, LFAs have a high degree of variation in band intensity within the CP donor population.",

Indeed, anecdotal results have been reported for seasonal coronavirus experimental infection studies. For example, one study of 229E HCoV found a positive correlation between pre-infection antibody titer and neutralization activity with symptom clinical severity.(17) In another study, 7 of 8 individuals with low neutralizing titers excreted virus upon re-exposure, compared to only 1 of 4 subjects with higher titers.(18) However, the conclusions of these studies are not directly comparable to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As such, the necessity of human epidemiological or vaccination studies are necessary to determine the minimum threshold of neutralizing activity necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Conversely, sub-neutralizing antibody levels have been reported to facilitate, rather than inhibit, viral entry of the some coronaviruses in vitro, through antibody dependent enhancement (ADE).(19-21) While ADE dependent replication has not been demonstrated to occur in SARS-CoV, viral uptake into macrophages via antibody association with Fc receptors does induce IL-6 and TNFa cytokines which may promote inflammation and tissue damage.(22) Insights gained from an accurate analysis of antibody levels and neutralization activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals will help address these important questions and the corresponding health consequences.",
