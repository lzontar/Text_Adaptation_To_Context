DCs are found throughout the body and are especially common at mucosal surfaces. With only a single layer of epithelial cells separating the external from the internal world amid the constant need for particle exchange, intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis as well as governing protective immune responses against invading pathogens. To avoid activation of selfreactive T cells and to limit unnecessary responses, such as those against commensal fl ora, DCs can imprint tolerance onto T cells (Fig. 9.22 ). Immature-type DCs are enriched underneath the epithelium of mucosal inductive sites and are poised to capture antigens. They extend protrusions between epithelial cells, enabling direct sampling of luminal antigens [ 69 ] . Through upregulation of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules, matured DCs convert into highly effi cient antigen-presenting cells. Successful antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells requires recognition of cognate peptide in the context of MHC class II molecules, whereas epitopes presented on MHC class I molecules stimulate Ag-specifi c CD8+ T cells. When antigen uptake occurs, these DCs change their phenotype by expressing higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules and move to T cell areas of inductive sites for antigen presentation. Thus, DCs and their derived cytokines play key roles in the induction of antigen-specifi c effector Th cell responses. In this regard, targeting mucosal DCs is an effective strategy to induce mucosal and systemic immune responses. LAB Persistence. The ability of some LAB to persist in the gastrointestinal tract may be critically important in the effectiveness of LAB-based vaccines. A comparison of a persisting LAB strain, L. plantarum , with a nonpersisting LAB strain, L. lactis , identifi ed L. plantarum to be more effective at eliciting antigen-specifi c immunity, suggesting that persistence promoted immunogenicity [ 70 ] . Furthermore, it has been shown that particular Lactobacillus species induced critical infl ammatory cytokines and induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells [ 71 ] . It has also been shown that immature DCs effi ciently capture Lactobacillus species, and these bacteria activated human DCs, resulting in the production of pro-infl ammatory cytokines like IL-12, increased proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and skewed T cell response toward a Th1 pathway believed to be involved in effective clearance of microbial pathogens [ 72 , 73 ] ( Fig. 9.23 ). Evidence suggests that the peptidoglycan layer of some LAB promote natural immuno-adjuvanticity [ 74 ] , and antigen localization on the cell wall makes it more accessible to the immune system as compared to intracellular or secreted proteins. Leader peptides mark proteins for translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane, and lipid modifi cation is of major importance both for anchoring exported proteins to the membrane and for protein function [ 75 ] . It has been shown that lipidation at the fi rst amino acid of the mature Borrelia burgdorferi OspA protein is essential to induce an immune response via TLR2 [ 76 ] . The leader peptide of OspA targets the protein to the cell envelope of Lactobacillus and that the Cys [ 17 ] is recognized by the L. plantarum cell wall-sorting machinery that lipidates and anchors the protein to the cell envelope. The end result is a delivery system that exerts a potent adjuvant effect [ 77 ] . Virus-like Particles (VLPs) that mimic the antigenic architecture of authentic virions, however, can be produced in insect, mammalian, and plant cells by the expression of the capsid protein. The particulate nature and high-density presentation of viral structure proteins on their surface render VLPs as a premier vaccine platform with superior safety, immunogenicity, and manufacturability. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the development of effective NoV vaccines based on VLPs of capsid proteins.

GAS that breaches the physical barrier of the mucosal epithelium of the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, functionally analogous to human tonsils, is purported to be transported to the underlying lymphoid tissue via association with membranous (M) cells. Cells of the innate immune system sense GAS and produce cytokines and chemokines to contain the infection to the mucosa. GAS antigens are delivered to antigen-presenting cells such as DCs and B cells. IgA-committed B cells are activated and initiate antigen-specifi c IgA responses. DCs play a fundamental role in the development of immunity to GAS and present antigen to T cells to induce a Th17 response that is integral along with IgA for mucosal defense against pharyngeal GAS colonization. Mucosal vaccination is designed to mimic these responses and effectively clear GAS from the mucosal surface upon infection to prevent GAS colonization and carriage. GAS that escapes the host's defense mechanisms can disseminate into the lymphatics and blood, leading to systemic infection. Mucosal vaccination is also able to induce a systemic immune response characterized by the induction of opsonic IgG antibodies, which destroy the pathogen by opsonophagocytosis. Parenteral GAS vaccination induces serum IgG but is not able to induce mucosal immunity and should not induce immune responses that are potentially cross-reactive with self tissue proteins.

Multivalent GAS vaccine . A multivalent approach employs a combination of amino-terminal protein fragments representing different M types and is designed to target prevalent GAS strains in a population. Using this approach, a recombinant multivalent GAS vaccine containing M protein peptides from 26 different GAS serotypes prevalent in North America was demonstrated to evoke opsonic antibodies in animals [ 102 ] . From epidemiological data, the 26-valent vaccine would cover the majority of pharyngitis and invasive GAS diseases, including RF, invasive fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome. Recently, a new 30-valent GAS vaccine was shown to be immunogenic in rabbits and evoked opsonic antibodies against \"non-vaccine\" serotypes [ 103 ] potentially creating a vaccine with much broader coverage. This type of vaccine is population specifi c and therefore may not be effective universally. It may also need to be re-designed periodically to refl ect changes in the epidemiology of GAS infections.

The LCP system contains an adjuvant component (lipid-core made of lipoamino acids) and a polylysine carrier onto which peptide epitopes are attached.

The adjuvant has three 2-amino-dodecanoic ( n = 9) lipoamino acids separated by glycine amino acid spacers 2. J8 vaccine . A GAS vaccine that employs peptide epitopes from the conserved C-repeat region of the M protein is the second approach and has the potential in theory for greater coverage of M types. Immunization of mice with a C-region peptide GAS vaccine candidate called J8 conjugated to the carrier protein diphtheria toxoid (dT) and co-delivery with an appropriate adjuvant led to protection against systemic and mucosal GAS infection [ 104 ] (Fig. 9.29 ). J8 also elicited protective immunity against GAS when linked to lipopeptides [ 105 , 106 ] . Other studies have shown that intranasal immunization of mice with C-region peptides conjugated to the experimental mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) evoked protective immunity against GAS at the mucosal level [ 107 ] . CTB could possibly enter olfactory regions of the central nervous system and cause neuronal damage following intranasal delivery [ 108 ] and therefore is not suitable for human use.

The third combination vaccine approach uses both serotypic and conserved M protein peptide epitopes. Initially, a heteropolymer GAS vaccine construct was synthesized by free radical-induced polymerization of acryloyl peptides to combine seven serotypic epitopes and a highly conserved C-region peptide epitope called J14 [ 112 ] . The M types that were targeted in the heteropolymer represented GAS infections prevalent in the Northern Territory of Australia -a region highly endemic for GAS.

Only a small portion of pDNA will cross the cell membrane and faces exo-and endonuclease. But a small portion is tagged with NLS (nuclear localization sequence). This NLS decoration is recognized by importin that transport the DNA cargo from the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the nucleus. Only molecules smaller than 39 nm can pass. Once inside the nucleus, interaction with Ran-GTP causes a conformational change in the importin, resulting in the dissociation from its cargo. The resulting complex of importin and Ran-GTP translocates to the cytoplasm, where Ran-GTP will be separated from importin, a process called the Ran-GTP nuclear transport cycle (biological barriers )", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "This vaccine was approved for veterinary use by USDA in July 2005 and released to public in December 2008.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "lethal pulmonary challenge : Many of the recent vaccine development efforts have been tested in the mouse lethal pulmonary model.
