On the other hand, TRIB3 gene has been linked to fatty acid synthesis 201 control and insulin resistance, in addition to regulating plasma levels of triglycerides and HDL 202 cholesterol in humans (42) and was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication; 203 so TRIB3 can be considered a therapeutic target for COVID-19 (18). 204 Irisin is found in human blood at concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/ml; circulates at ~3.6 ng/ml in 205 sedentary individuals; this level is increased to ~4.3 ng/ml in individuals undergoing aerobic interval 206 training (43). The involvement of irisin in viral infection is poorly understood; however, a cross-207 sectional study of patients with HIV demonstrated that irisin levels correlated negatively with body 208 fat and positively with fat-free mass and strength parameters (44). In another scenario, researchers 209 verified that FNDC5 overexpression or irisin supplementation could preserve mitochondrial function 210 and attenuate oxidative damage as well as cell apoptosis (45, 46). Irisin is known for stimulating markers of the white adipose tissue browning process 212 contributing to energy metabolism, tissue regeneration, cell proliferation and also in decreasing 213 insulin resistance, helping to transport glucose into the muscles and consequently, lowering blood 214 glucose (45). However, its effects on the hormonal regulation and metabolic process are not 215 completely understood. We demonstrated that irisin reduced FURIN, which participates along with 216 other genes, also downregulated by irisin, in the enrichment of 14 terms in GO. The terms include 217 protein maturation, cellular response to transforming growth factor-beta stimulus, extracellular 218 matrix organization, multicellular organism metabolism, regulation of lipase activity, and receptor 219 metabolism; the interaction between these terms can be seen in figure 1. FURIN is one of the 220 proteases responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of avian influenza virus activating the 221 haemagglutinin (47), and for the cleavage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope 222 polyprotein precursor gp160 to gp120 and gp41 prior to viral assembly (48). Therefore, our results 223 proving that irisin downregulates FURIN, which presents a proved impact on SARS-CoV-2 cleavage 224 to human cells, may indicate that the treatment with irisin, through FURIN reduction, could 225 consequently result in impaired SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we observed that the reduction 226 of ADAM10, along with other genes, after irisin enrichment resulted in 12 terms in GO, represented 227 by protein maturation, negative regulation of cell adhesion and cell growth, as described in table 2 228 and in interactive graphic in Figure.2. Since ADAM10 can be a candidate enzyme responsible for the 229 FNDC5 cleavage (49), the reduction of ADAM10 mRNA in our study can be explained by the 230 administration of exogenous irisin. The reduction of ADAM10 by irisin resulted in the enrichment of 231 the biological process Notch signaling pathway; because this pathway is thought to play a major role 232 during the differentiation and the activity of innate and adaptive immune cells (50), it is possible that 233 irisin treatment indirectly results in a more efficient immune system. 234 Moreover, our data showed that the diminished ADAM10 and FURIN lead to the enrichment 235 of common processes such as extracellular structure organization, protein maturation, protein 236 processing membrane and protein ectodomain proteolysis. Anders et al. (51) and Hwang et al. (52) 237described that the activity of ADAM10 is also controlled by furin protein, which could be in line with 238 our findings since treatment with irisin decreased FURIN and ADAM10 mRNA. The reduction of 239 both genes could be beneficial for cell and extracellular processes.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the definition of the most severe form of 241 acute lung injury (ALI). ARDS and ALI are severe clinical conditions that are associated with excessive inflammatory response, sepsis, impaired gas exchange, alveolar-capillary barrier 243 disruption, and pulmonary edema (53-57). Therefore, patients with ALI/ARDS, among other 244 symptoms, present decreased oxygenation capacity, bilateral lung ground-glass edge on chest 245 radiographs, and an increase in breathing rate (56, 57). A recent histopathological study 246 demonstrated that irisin ameliorated the lung injury that was induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) 247 in C57BL/6J mice and A549 cell (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells), and 248 suppressed the production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, and apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells 249 (58). Although alveolar cells do not express irisin, previous studies using exogenous irisin indicated 250 that these cells benefit from irisin in case the pulmonary tissue is damaged; the administration of 251 irisin in mice subjected to ischemia demonstrated that inflammation in the lungs was reduced, there 252 was evident tissue repair, and hypoxemia and proinflammatory cytokines were decreased.(59). The 253 clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are varied and are similar to those described above 254 by ARDS e ALI (10, 53-57), a fact that reinforces testing irisin in cases of COVID-19. These data 255 also support a promising potential for irisin in the battle against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and since 256 literature in this domain is scarce, further researches are required.",

            "text": "The data presented byPinto et al., 2020 (16)  andMoraes et al., 2020 (18)  offer gene targets 258 for preventing severe COVID-19. Drugs that act on these gene targets, inhibiting ADAM10, TLR3, 259 HAT1, HDAC2, KDM5B, SIRT1, RAB1A and FURIN, or stimulating TRIB3, should be explored. Our260 results from adipose tissue treatment with irisin showed a decrease in the expression of practically all 261 targets mentioned by Pinto et al., 2020 (16) and increased TRIB3 mentioned by Moraes et al., 2020 262 (18). Researches conducted in the lung tissue are required in order to validate if the same occurs in 263 pulmonary spectrum. 264 In conclusion, irisin presented a very positive effect in the regulation of diverse genes related 265 to the COVID-19 outcome in the adipose tissue, causing reduction of genes implicated in elevated 266 viral infection, and increase in genes that block virus-cell cleavage; these results indicate that irisin 267 treatment could end in a reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in human cells. The obesity is 268 associated with an increased recruitment of macrophages in the adipose tissue (60), and irisin 269 modulates macrophage activity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and 270 increasing the expression of anti-oxidative stress factors (61, 62); thus, the beneficial effects of irisin 271 not only depend on the positive effect on the regulation of diverse genes related to the COVID-19 272outcome in the adipose tissue, but also to its anti-inflammatory properties related to the targeting of macrophages. These results might be translatable for other tissues and systems, considering the genes 274 targeted are expressed in several body cell types. Since the respiratory system is the most 275 considerably affected in COVID-19, the effect of irisin in the lung tissue and the resulting gene 276 expression must be tested. Therefore, we expect with our data, while preliminary and speculative, to 277 stimulate further investigations relating to irisin and gene expression in other tissues than the 278 adipose. This might evoke a COVID-19 therapeutic strategy to stimulate TRIB3 expression and 279 decrease ACE2 regulatory genes, possibly aiding patients with both mild outcomes as well as the 280 ones suffering from severe COVID-19.",
