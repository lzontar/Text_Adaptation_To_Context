The latter is possibly confused in the last days, as \"sub-intensive care\" units were created. As for the former, this is possibly influenced by the fact that in the presence of a large number of infected with heavy symptoms there is little chance to analyze people with light symptoms or who just had contacts with known infected but show no symptoms; this could explain why \u03c1 remained around 0.5 for several days to fall down as the number of infections raised sharply.

We noted that the exponential growth rate in these countries range from 0.36 of Germany to 0.47 of Spain, with an intermediate 0.38 for France. These worrying figures should be compared with the initial growth rate in Italy, i.e. 0.34 for the whole country with 0.29 for the most affected region, i.e. Lombardia; they mean the possibility of a large COVID-19 epidemic in these countries in the next weeks should not be discarded unless prompt action is taken there too.
