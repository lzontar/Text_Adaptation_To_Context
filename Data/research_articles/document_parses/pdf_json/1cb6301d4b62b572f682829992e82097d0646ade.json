Phylogenetic studies have suggested the dominance of purifying selection in the evolution of arboviruses, consistent with constraints imposed by differing replication environments and requirements in arthropod and vertebrate hosts. Molecular genetic studies of alphaviruses and flaviviruses have also identified several mutations that effect differentially the replication in vertebrate and mosquito cells, consistent with the view that arboviruses must adopt compromise fitness characteristics for each host. More recently, evidence of positive selection has also been obtained from these studies. However, experimental model systems employing arthropod and vertebrate cell cultures have yielded conflicting conclusions on the effect of alternating host infections, with host specialization inconsistently resulting in fitness gains or losses in the bypassed host cells. Further studies using in vivo systems to study experimental arbovirus evolution are critical to understanding and predicting disease emergence, which often results from virus adaptation to new vectors or amplification hosts. Reverse genetic technologies that are now available for most arbovirus groups should be exploited to test assumptions and hypotheses derived from retrospective phylogenetic approaches.",

Although several of these viruses can be maintained in their arthropod hosts alone via transovarial transmission and some generate persistent infection of vertebrates, most if not all of these viruses require occasional or frequent horizontal transmission among vertebrate hosts by biological vectors, in which replication must occur. Therefore, arboviruses must acquire and retain fitness for replication in disparate vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. This fundamental difference with respect to most animal RNA and nearly all animal DNA viruses, which tend to specialize, on certain taxa of vertebrates, arthropods or other animals, presents unique evolutionary challenges along with many advantages of vector transmission such as high mobility and the lack of a need to be shed into bodily secretions. These challenges have probably greatly influenced the evolution of vector transmission by limiting it to only a few families of RNA viruses and a single taxon of DNA viruses.",

However, there is relatively little evidence of severe disease in reservoir hosts; most of the apparent disease caused by arboviruses involves humans, equines and other ungulates, and other domestic animals representing deadend infections that do not exert long-term evolutionary pressures. The lack of apparent disease in many reservoir hosts may reflect selection for resistance by populations exposed for long time periods to infection and/or selection for attenuation of arboviruses in these species. These competing hypotheses are difficult to evaluate experimentally aside from the use of model cell culture systems (see below). However, the recent introduction of West Nile virus into North America provides a unique opportunity to observe these hypothetical evolutionary pressures on an arbovirus in vivo, in nature (Weaver and Barrett 2004) .",

Aside from Rubella virus (the sole member of the genus Rubivirus) and two alphaviruses with no known vector (southern elephant seal virus and salmon pancreas disease virus), all togaviruses are mosquito-borne viruses in the genus Alphavirus . In humans and domestic animals, alphaviruses cause a spectrum of disease ranging from inapparent to highly pathogenic syndromes including arthralgia accompanied by rash, and severe, often fatal encephalitis (Griffin 2001; Tsai et al. 2002) . The most important causes of severe morbidity and mortality include the New World members Venezuelan (VEEV), eastern (EEEV) and western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), etiologic agents of encephalitis in humans and equines, and Old World alphaviruses that cause a severe but self-limiting arthralgia and rash syndrome, including Ross River, Chikungunya, and o'nyong-nyong viruses. Epidemiological studies suggest that the latter viruses can use humans as amplification hosts during some outbreaks; otherwise, the alphaviruses generally use birds or small mammals as reservoir and amplification hosts, with humans and domestic animals representing dead-end infections. However, a notable exception is VEEV, which exploits equines as highly efficient amplification hosts, resulting in explosive and widespread epidemics Fig. 1 Phylogenetic tree of all species and major lineages of alphaviruses derived from E1 envelope glycoprotein sequences.

In contrast to their relationships with vectors, where a given alphavirus typically uses one or a few mosquito species as primary vectors, individual alphavirus species and lineages may use several different vertebrates simultaneously; for example, EEEV infects a variety of passeriform birds in enzootic swamp habitats of North America, many of which generate viremia sufficient for horizontal transmission by the highly susceptible and ornithophilic enzootic vector, Culiseta melanura (Scott and Weaver 1989) . Although an important role in maintenance has not been established for many groups, alphaviruses like EEEV infect an extremely diverse group of vertebrates, including birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles.

This pattern suggests that adaptation to different vectors, such as other biting flies or ticks, is genetically difficult, and/or that arboviruses have evolved as generalists for their vertebrate hosts but specialists with respect to their vectors. However, the specificity for vectors is often manifested only at the level of midgut infection, and most alphaviruses replicate in most mosquitoes following intrathoracic inoculation, which is analogous to infection of a vertebrate via a vector bite or needle. Better understanding of the interactions between host factors and arboviruses during infection and replication is needed to understand differences in vertebrate and vector host specificity.",

Even the 26S subgenomic promoter sequence that is conserved but includes a few differences among alphaviruses shows no evidence of adaptive substitutions, and most of the promoter sequences are interchangeable between SINV and other species (Hertz and Huang 1992) . Studies of genetic diversity within alphavirus populations indicate a quasispecies distribution of genetic variants similar to that exhibited by single-host RNA viruses, suggesting that mutation frequencies are not the explanation for the genetic stability observed (Weaver et al. 1993 ).

These analyses have typically yielded estimates on the order of thousands of years for divergence of arbovirus groups from common ancestors. However, the strong evidence of co-speciation of certain rodent-borne viruses with their reservoir hosts, including some in the family Bunyaviridae, which includes many arboviruses, indicate a time scale of tens of millions of years for these RNA virus groups (Morzunov et al. 1998 ). The bunyaviruses and arenaviruses exhibit genetic diversity comparable to or in some cases greater than those exhibited by arboviruses. Therefore, reconciliation of time scales derived from co-speciation evidence coupled with the fossil record, vs phylogenetic techniques, which differ by several orders of magnitude for divergence of these groups, is problematic. One possible explanation is that the phylogenetic methods are not yet capable of accurately compensating for multiple substitutions of nucleotides and variation in the rates of substitution among nucleotide sites (Holmes 2003) . Assumptions that most synonymous nucleotide sites in RNA viral genomes are subject to little or no selection, and therefore exhibit little variability in substitution rates, may be invalid due to genome-scale, ordered RNA structures that can now be identified using improved computational tools (Simmonds et al. 2004 ). These structures need to be examined experimentally to determine their influence on RNA virus evolution.",

Numbers indicate bootstrap values for major clades to the right conservation in the tick-borne than mosquito-borne groups has suggested that different selective constraints operate during the evolution of these two groups (Shiu et al. 1991) . The tick-borne viruses appear to have evolved in a progressive, clinal pattern from east to west across Asia and Europe (Zanotto et al. 1995) , while the mosquito-borne flaviviruses have evolved in a more discontinuous manner, probably in several different regions of the world. The mosquito-borne viruses tend to exhibit relatively long time periods between lineage divergence, suggesting a \"boom and bust\" pattern of intense diversification followed by extinction of many lineages (Zanotto et al. 1996) . The best examples of this pattern are DENV, which appear to be undergoing a period of rapid radiation (Holmes and Twiddy 2003a) . Detailed maximum likelihood analyses of DENV isolates to analyze rates of synonymous vs nonsynonymous substitution suggest that different genotypes or lineages experience different selective pressures, including positive selection on some amino acid sites implicated in virulence and transmissibility (Twiddy et al. 2002a) . Amino acid positions subject to weak, positive selection were also identified in the envelope glycoprotein of some but not all DENV serotypes. The majority of these amino acid sites were located in, or near to, putative T or B cell epitopes, suggesting immune selection, as well as in the NS2B and NS5 genes of DENV-2 (Twiddy et al. 2002b) . These kinds of studies implying positive selection should be followed up with reverse genetic validation of fitness effects in mosquito vectors or surrogate model systems for human infection.",

Flaviviruses with mammalian hosts exhibiting more limited dispersal, such as yellow fever virus, which uses nonhuman primate reservoir hosts, tend to be partitioned into smaller, geographically delineated populations (Bryant et al. 2003) . However, the dengue viruses, which are perhaps the most mobile arboviruses due to the extensive and rapid travel behavior of human reservoir hosts, exhibit complex patterns of evolution within multiple lineages that are frequently introduced into new locations and also appear to undergo local extinctions (Holmes and Twiddy 2003; Thu et al. 2004) . Genetic studies suggest that population shifts and replacements may be selected by adaptive mutations in the DENV nonstructural proteins (Bennett et al. 2003) and in cytotoxic T cell epitopes (Hughes 2001) . Fitness for transmission may be responsible for some of these population changes; evidence from Ae. aegypti susceptibility studies suggests that an Asian genotype that has recently colonized the New World is more infectious than the American genotype it is replacing in some locations (Armstrong and Rico-Hesse 2003) . This change in the distribution of DENV genotypes has critical public health implications because the Asian genotype is more likely to cause hemorrhagic disease (Watts et al. 1999) .",

Multiple feeding may increase the chances of dual infections in both mosquitoes (from biting more than one viremic human during a short time period) and in humans (from receiving multiple Ae. aegypti bites during a short time period due to this vector's endophilic resting and feeding behavior, and its peridomestic larval habitats.",

At the right, secondary amplification involving domestic animals can increase circulation around humans, increasing their chance of infection via spillover. Examples include Rift Valley fever, Japanese and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). In the case of VEEV, mutations that enhance equine viremia mediate secondary equine amplification. At the left, dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses can use humans directly for amplification, resulting in urban epidemic cycles and massive outbreaks. In the case of dengue viruses, humans also serve as reservoir hosts Good examples include JEV, which infects pigs and chickens living in close proximity to humans in many parts of Asia, resulting in local amplification and transmission to humans by mosquitoes that do not necessarily include the avian enzootic reservoir hosts among their preferred blood sources (Endy and Nisalak 2002) . Another is Rift Valley fever virus, which amplifies itself in secondary cycles involving cattle, sheep, and other ungulates (Bouloy 2001). These viruses rely on wide vertebrate host ranges, as well as on susceptible vectors that feed on several hosts, to cause human disease via spillover from secondary amplification cycles.

Several arboviruses such as Ross River and chikungunya probably use humans as temporary amplification hosts during epidemic conditions, but there is no evidence that adaptation is involved. Chikungunya is particularly successful at exploiting human amplification because it uses a highly anthropophilic vector, Ae. aegypti (Woodall 2001) . This mosquito itself underwent an evolutionary recent adaptation from the ancestral, sylvatic form found in West Africa, Ae. aegypti formosus (Tabachnick and Powell 1979) . The derived form Ae. aegypti aegypti now lives in close contact with people in urban settings by relying on artificial water containers for its larval habitats, becoming endophilic to increase contact with people, and relying on blood (instead of plant carbohydrates) for its energetic needs (Harrington et al. 2001) .",

These strains utilize sylvatic treehole mosquitoes as vectors and nonhuman primates as reservoir hosts (Rudnick 1984; Diallo et al. 2003) . Phylogenetic studies indicate that hundreds to thousands of years ago, the four DENV serotypes each underwent ecological and host range changes to establish peridomestic and later urban transmission cycles (Wang et al. 2000; Holmes and Twiddy 2003) . These endemic and epidemic DENV strains use humans as their sole reservoir hosts and peridomestic mosquitoes as vectors to cause a huge burden of human disease in the tropics and subtropics. Experimental studies indicate that the ancestral, sylvatic DENV-2 strains underwent adaptation to increase their ability to infect the peridomestic vectors, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Moncayo et al. 2004 ). Adaptation to human reservoir hosts may have been equally critical to human dengue emergence. In addition, the partial cross-protectivity exhibited among the four DENV serotypes may have allowed for the co-circulation of closely related DENV strains leading to immune enhancement, which can result in severe hemorrhagic forms of disease (Ferguson et al. 1999) .",

However, predicting the ability of sylvatic DENV strains to re-emerge will depend on a more thorough understanding of human pathogenesis following sylvatic strain infection, and characterization of the genetic changes required to adapt to humans and peridomestic vectors.

However, greater genetic diversity has been identified in humans naturally infected with DENV-3 than in Ae. aegypti either naturally or experimentally infected, suggesting that the mosquito vector constrains DENV evolution (Lin et al. 2004 ). This constraint may simply reflect the smaller population sizes and lesser amount of viral replication in mosquitoes than in vertebrate hosts.

Biological clones from both the original virus population and the 10th passage in mice were heterogeneous with respect to virulence, indicative of a quasispecies distribution. Most interesting was the finding that alternate passage between Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and mice resulted in no detectable change in virulence of two different wild-type virus strains (Taylor and Marshall 1975b) . The authors speculated that the conservation of initial virulence by alternating mosquito-mouse passages could be related to the fact that Ae. aegypti can only be infected when fed on mice at the time of peak viremia, when a subpopulation of higher virulence is not present in high enough infectivity to be represented in the mosquito's blood meal (Taylor and Marshall 1975b) .",

To determine if promoter utilization varies in vertebrate vs mosquito cells, Hertz and Huang (1995b) passaged SINV containing a library of different promoter sequences in hamster and mosquito cells. Selection was faster and more rapid in mosquito cells, which selected a smaller number of promoter sequences. Extensive passaging of the viral libraries in hamster cells led to a promoter consensus sequence that increasingly resembled the wild type, suggesting that the wildtype and similar sequences are optimal for promoter function in hamster cells (Hertz and Huang 1995a) ; similar results were obtained from mosquito cell passage (Hertz and Huang 1995b) . These studies suggest that SINV makes little or no evolutionary compromise in maintaining the ability to replicate alternately in the two disparate host organisms.",

Preliminary studies in our laboratory have yielded results that differ dramatically from in vitro model systems. When three different alphaviruses were introduced into laboratory transmission cycles involving unnatural hosts and vectors, high degrees of genetic stability were invariably observed, with no amino acid substitutions detected following ten cycles. No fitness changes could be detected in either the mosquito or vertebrate hosts (SCW, unpublished). However, specialization of VEEV for replication in hamsters without mosquito transmission resulted in a rapid gain in fitness, with faster viremia appearance and higher peak titers (Brault 2001) .

Large population sizes favor efficient natural selection; in the case of arboviruses, phylogenetic studies indicate that purifying selection acts to maintain phenotypic traits. However, the exact phenotypes under selection have not been determined comprehensively. The amino acid sequences of arboviral proteins are clearly one target of such purifying selection, as indicated by the overwhelming preponderance of synonymous mutations in arboviral genomes. However, in addition to conserved, cis-acting sequences in arboviral genomes that are under selection for primary RNA sequence and secondary RNA structure, genome-scale ordered RNA structures have been identified in some arboviruses (Simmonds et al. 2004) . Such structures could introduce additional constraints on RNA virus evolution, and could also confound phylogenetic methods for estimating the ages of virus lineages due to violations of assumptions related to heterogeneity in mutation rates across nucleotide sites.",

In the most extreme example, genetic bottlenecks can result in inefficient natural selection and rapid genetic drift (see also the chapter by Escarm\u00eds et al., this volume). This can result in the random fixation of mutations that can be deleterious for an organism without sufficient recombinatorial capacity or opportunity, resulting in progressive fitness declines via Muller's ratchet; such effects have been demonstrated for the arboviruses VSV (Duarte et al. 1992) and EEEV (Weaver et al. 1999) . Genetic drift can also facilitate the sampling of novel phenotypes, which cannot be selected in a step-wise fashion due to the lack of intermediate genotypes with improved fitness and the complexity of the selective landscape. A small population size could therefore be essential to allowing certain mutants to persist in nature. When bluetongue virus was placed in a laboratory transmission cycle involving Culicoides sonorensis vectors and sheep or calves, individual gene segments appeared to evolve independently by genetic drift in a host-specific fashion (Bonneau et al. 2001 ). In one case, a unique variant was randomly ingested by C. sonorensis insects that fed on a low titer blood meal, representing a genetic bottleneck, thereby fixing this new genotype by a founder effect. Additional studies of this kind are needed to assess the effects of blood meal titers on introducing bottlenecks leading to founder effects and genetic drift.",

Positive selection suggested by some phylogenetic studies may reflect past adaptive events or those in progress, but for the most part have not been validated experimentally. A fundamental question requiring additional experimental studies is whether these host-switching events require adaptation or simply take advantage of pre-existing, coincidental fitness for a new host. Experiments to answer this question are now possible using reverse genetic approaches now available for many arboviruses, and are critical for predicting the emergence of future arboviral diseases. For example, many zoonotic arboviruses circulate in tropical forest habitats that are being rapidly eliminated for logging and agriculture. The elimination of these natural habitats coupled with the rapid expansion of tropical urban populations is undoubtedly placing selective pressures on arboviruses to adapt for human-to-human transmission. The end results could be more DENV-like transmission cycles exploiting humans as reservoir and amplification hosts, with devastating public health consequences. Retrospective studies to determine the genetic determinants of adaptation to new hosts by DENV and other arboviruses will be invaluable in predicting the likelihood of additional arboviral urbanization and disease emergence.",
