This paper presents first insights in current and potential future effects of the virus and the Dutch government's 'intelligent lockdown' on people's activities and travel behaviour. Findings are based on a representative sample of about 2500 respondents from the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN). We show that approximately 80% of people reduced their activities outdoors, with a stronger decrease for older people. 44% of workers started or increased the amount of hours working from home and 30% have more remote meetings. Most of these workers report positive experiences. Students and school pupils, however, are mostly not happy with following education from home. Furthermore, the amount of trips and distance travelled dropped by 55% and 68% respectively when compared to the fall of 2019. So-called 'roundtrips' (e.g. a walking or cycling tour) gained in popularity. People are currently more positive towards the car and far more negative towards public transport. Changes in outdoor activities seem to be temporal, with over 90% of people who currently reduced their outdoor activities not expecting to continue this behaviour in the future after corona. However, 27% of home-workers expect to work from home more often in the future. In addition, 20% of people expect to cycle and walk more and 20% expect to fly less in the future. These findings show that the coronavirus crisis might result in structural behavioural changes, although future longitudinal analyses are needed to observe these possible structural effects.",

However, several studies have shown that there are certain events in people's life course that trigger change in travel behaviour (M\u00fcggenburg et al., 2015; Schoenduwe et al., 2015) . Sch\u00e4fer et al. (2012) describe these life events as 'windows of opportunity' to change people's habitual routines. Earlier research has for instance shown that changing jobs leads to a mode shift towards the car (Oakil et al., 2011) and that people tend to shift to a travel pattern in which mainly car and walking trips are made (de Haas et al., 2018; Scheiner & Holz-Rau, 2013) . Other research shows that not only travel patterns, but also activity patterns are less stable after such events (Hilgert et al., 2018) . Besides changing behaviour themselves after certain life events, research has also shown that people are more susceptible to interventions after these events (Anable, 2013; Verplanken & Roy, 2016) . The current lockdown situation may be a similar 'game changer' having comparable effects on behaviour as life events, with the exception that it occurs for society as a whole and that it is externally induced.",

Dean (2013) showed that the length of time required to create new habitual behaviour depends on the type of new behaviour one wants to learn. Forming habits for relatively simple activities, such as drinking a glass of water with breakfast, is much easier than forming habits for more difficult activities, such as incorporating an activity like jogging into a daily pattern. Furthermore, Sigurdardottir et al. (2013) revealed the importance of both positive and negative experiences; for example, it was easier for people to make cycling part of their daily routine if they had more positive experiences with cycling when they were young. Trying out new activities can help in adopting new habits, as this experience may show that obstacles that were initially envisioned (for instance that cycling requires too much effort or is unsafe) turn out to be untrue (Str\u00f6mberg & Karlsson, 2016) . As people in the Netherlands (and many other countries) now have to follow directives to stay at home, many are now forming experiences with new behaviour. These experiences might affect future behaviour, long after the virus itself is no longer a threat. People might for instance prefer to work from home in the future, now that they have experienced what it is like to work from home.",

The relationship between attitudes and travel behaviour has been studied extensively and it has been shown that attitudes indeed play a role in mode choice behaviour (G\u00e4rling et al., 1998; Paulssen et al., 2014) . The influence of attitudes on mode choice behaviour was found to be particularly strong in cases where habit is weak (Verplanken et al., 1994) . This is particularly interesting in the light of the current COVID-19 situation, as many people are forced to, at least temporarily, break their habits. It may be expected that attitudes have changed as a result of COVID-19. People might for instance have a more negative attitude towards shared travel modes, due to the fear that they might become infected with the virus when using these modes. If this change in attitudes turns out to be a structural, it might have structural effects on travel behaviour. For instance, people might structurally shift from public transport to car for commuting. Such a shift could have negative consequences in terms of both sustainability and accessibility. To understand possible effects of COVID-19 and the lockdown on travel behaviour in a future without the disease insights are needed into how people are experiencing its current effects and how these experiences relate to travel behaviour and attitudes.",

The high popularity of motorized transport comes with a number of issues such as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 increased congestion, damage to the environment and human health due to emissions, and reduced liveability of cities. In the EU, road transport is responsible for more than 70% of all CO 2 transport emissions and up to 30% of small particulate emissions in the EU (Alonso Raposo et al., 2019) . Furthermore, it is expected that urbanization rates will further increase in the future, with an expected share of 70% of people worldwide living in urban areas by 2050 (The World Bank, 2019). This will not only put more pressure on the transport system as transport demand will increase, it also means that more people will be affected by its negative side effects such as congestion and emissions. To deal with these challenges, governments are looking to not only change the transport system itself, but also the behaviour of its users. In this light, it is important to monitor the temporal changes in travel behaviour due to the coronavirus crisis and assess whether these will result in structural behavioural changes.",

The aim of this framework is to show how the coronavirus might have affected people's current behaviour, as well as how it might structurally affect future behaviour. In the framework, two separate drivers of behavioural change associated with COVID-19 are distinguished. The first is the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the personal situation. This encompasses, for instance, a change in work situation as businesses are closed as well as the fear of becoming or actually being infected with the virus. The second category are governments measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus, which in the Netherlands at the time of data collection consisted of a so-called 'intelligent lockdown', which was further explained in the introduction.",

Preferences here are defined as a broad concept and may for instance be influenced by attitudes or the way people experience certain behaviour. From previous studies it is known that attitudes play a role in determining people's travel behaviour (Bohte et al., 2009) . Preferences may directly be influenced by COVID-19 as people might, for instance, prefer to avoid places where keeping 1.5m distance to others is difficult, such as public transport. Preferences may also be influenced through experiences with new behaviour. For example, a negative experience with grocery shopping outdoors in the current situation may result in a lower preference for outdoor shopping. Given that a bi-directional relation between attitudes and behaviour seems to exist (Kroesen et al., 2017) , such a negative experience with grocery shopping in itself might again affect this behaviour. Social demographics might mediate these relationships; for example, older people might react differently to the impacts of COVID-19 than younger people.",

People are suddenly confronted with new behaviour, which is, in many cases, different from their 'normal' habits. This may be a trigger for structural behavioural change to take place. When J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f experiences with the current (changed) behaviour are more positive, it is more likely to be reflected in positive expectations regarding continuing the behaviour in the future (Str\u00f6mberg & Karlsson, 2016) .

To study this, three relevant categories influencing mobility are identified: outdoor activities, work and education, and travel behaviour. If our outdoor activity patterns change, then our mobility demand will change as well. This research studies both general outdoor activities, like grocery shopping and social contacts, and the more specific activity of work or education. COVID-19 has undoubtedly changed the behaviours and experiences of these activities, if not due to the direct impact of the virus itself then due to the government's measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus. Activity patterns and the current situation of work and education influence people's travel patterns. In addition, preferences for certain travel modes could have changed which also may influence people's travel pattern. The main interest here is to what extent and how people have travelled and what their experiences are. The mode of transport, travelled distances, and attitudes towards modes are particularly relevant here.",

The finding that 90% of respondents indicate that the appeal by the government to stay at home is the main reason for the reduction in their outdoor activities is a further confirmation of this explanation. The second most reported reasons, that people do not want to go outside due to the virus itself (reported by about 80% of people) however would seemingly contradict this explanation.

Perhaps surprisingly, older people are a bit more positive compared to other age groups (\u03c7 2 (4, N = 2376) = 10.312, p = .035). Despite having sufficient access to groceries, most people experience grocery shopping as unpleasant in the current situation. Interestingly, this applies to both grocery shopping outdoors as well as ordering groceries online. By ordering groceries online one avoids a visit to the supermarket, and the associated risk of becoming infected. However, the capacity for delivery of online ordered groceries has turned out to be insufficient to accommodate the sudden increase in demand. Therefore, waiting times were long. This might explain why people experience online grocery shopping as unpleasant. Most respondents then also report that digital solutions for grocery shopping are not a sufficient replacement for physical shopping. As could be expected, especially older people are less positive in this respect, while people aged 25-44 are most positive (\u03c7 2 (4, N = 1814) = 46.437, p = .000). In addition, people in urban areas seem to be a bit more positive compared to people in less urban areas (\u03c7 2 (4, N = 1814) = 21.223, p = .000); perhaps because possibilities for digital grocery shopping are more prevalent in urban areas.",

Especially entrepreneurs and employees with a flexible contract are affected by the coronavirus crisis. Entrepreneurs report more changes to their work situation compared to non-entrepreneurs (\u03c7 2 (1, N = 1873) = 13.349, p = .000), and people with a flexible contract reported more changes compared to people with a contract for a fixed number of hours (\u03c7 2 (4, N = 1873) = 150.859, p = .000)). The most important reason for people to temporarily stop working is that their company closed down, followed by receiving less work from their clients or employer. The latter is also the most important reason for people to have decreased their working hours. Note that this information pertains to the week where data was collected. This situation can drastically change, depending on the length of time during which the economy has to be partly shut down to control the spread of the virus.",

Approximately 44% of workers reported that they either started to work from home or increased the hours that they are working from home. In 2019, 6% of respondents reported to work almost all their hours (>75%) from home. This figure sharply increased to 39% in the current situation. Currently, more than half (54%) of all workers work from home at least a part of the week. Physical meetings are also less common, with 30% of workers reporting an increase in remote meetings (for instance by videoconferencing). Since schools and universities were completely closed nearly all students and pupils need to follow education from their homes. These changes have resulted in a sizeable drop in the number of commuting and education trips, which causes a big change in our mobility system. Estimating the entirety of this impact is outside of the scope of this study, but one thing to look at is which people are more likely to work from home and how they commuted before. One J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f expectation here is that people who normally commute by public transport are more likely to have increased the number of hours they work from home since people were urged to avoid public transport as much as possible. Indeed, results show that this share is, with 69%, significantly higher among workers who usually commute by public transport (\u03c7 2 (1, N = 1425) = 35.655, p = .000).",

In September 2019, about 20% of the people stayed home on an average day. In our survey of March and early April 2020, respondents reported no trips in their travel diaries on 50% of the days. Not having to leave home for work or education, the government's appeal to stay at home and the fear of being infected when leaving their home are likely to play an important role in this sharp increase. People who are afraid to become infected stay at home significantly more often compared to people who are not afraid to become infected (53% versus 48%, \u03c7 2 (1, N = 6589) = 16.257, p = .000) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 The total number of trips and travelled distance in three days (as the MPN includes a three-day travel diary, these figures are reported for three day aggregates) has then also dropped considerably, with 55% and 68% respectively.

This significant drop in public transport use is not unexpected as both the government as well as public transport operators urged people to only travel by public transport if highly necessary.

Whereas before the coronavirus crisis approximately one in fifteen trips (7%) was such a roundtrip, this has increased to one in four trips (25%) in the 2020 wave. Absolutely speaking, the number of roundtrips increased by over 70%. Especially the number of cycling and walking tours increased as this is currently the most important reason for a roundtrip. Before the coronavirus crisis, the most important reason for a roundtrip was to walk the dog. This increase in tours by either foot or bicycle also has an effect on the average trip distance with these modes. While the overall average trip distance decreased from approximately 12 to 8 km, both cycling and walking show an increase in average trip distance. The average distance of a cycling trip has increased by 30%, from 3.3 to 4.3 km per trip. The length of walking trips increased even more with 83% from 1.2 to 2.2 km per trip. This is a result of the increase in relative importance of roundtrips, as we know from previous measurements of the MPN that roundtrips are generally longer in distance compared to more utilitarian trips.",

In the new measurement these attitudes however dropped even further, as less than 10% of people have a positive attitude towards train, bus, tram or metro. Besides public transport, there is a noticeably increase in the number of people who are very positive towards the car. Attitudes towards the bicycle and walking have not changed. These changes in attitudes are also reflected in the fact that almost all people (88%) indicate that they currently prefer to use individual modes (like car of bicycle) over public or shared modes of transport. People who are more afraid to become infected have a stronger preference for individual modes compared to people who do not fear of becoming infected (\u03c7 2 (4, N = 2443) = 71.811, p = .000).

The question whether these temporal effects will result in structural behavioural changes remains. Especially the observed changes in attitudes towards travel modes might partly be temporal, as they will partly revert to the pre-corona values when shared transport modes are considered to be safe again. People generally do not expect that the current situation will largely affect their use of travel modes in the future, as approximately 80% of people think they will use all travel modes just as much in the future after corona as they did before corona (Figure 10 ). Others think their mode choice use will change. For public transport there is a larger group thinking they will decrease their use, whereas for the private car more people think they will increase their use. These differences are however less strong than the expectations for the active modes walking and cycling. For cycling, 20% thinks they will increase their use as opposed to 3% who expects a decrease. For walking this is 21% and 5%, respectively. A possible explanation for this expected increase of walking and cycling are the current (positive) experiences. People may find the increase in walking and cycling tours to be a positive experience, which may result in the intention to also do this more often in the future. These effects are measured relatively shortly after the coronavirus reached the Netherlands, so long-term (economic) effects of the crisis were yet very unclear. The aforementioned expectations might change as a result from changes in expectations with regards to the economic effects of corona in the longer term. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on international travel is even larger than on daily regional mobility. Due to international travel restrictions many airlines have to keep large parts of their fleet grounded. Results from our survey show that 21% of people who have flown before expect to reduce their amount of air travel in the future after corona. Approximately 5% expects an increase in air travel. There seems to be a clear relationship between age and expectations for the amount of air travel in the future as older people expect a stronger decrease (\u03c7 2 (4, N = 1615) = 123.967, p = .000). While just under 16% of people under 65 years old expect to decrease their air travel, 43% of people 65 years or older do. This might be related to the fear to become infected with COVID-19. As the current pandemic showed that being abroad during the outbreak of a pandemic could for instance lead to problems returning home, it might be that older people do not feel comfortable to be dependent on aviation to return home. Another explanation might be that this is the result of older people expecting to fly less because of their age, irrespective of COVID-19.",

We show that there are major immediate changes in outdoor activities, work and travel behaviour due to COVID-19 and related governmental measures. We also show that people expect that some of these changes will last into a future without an active pandemic, as about 30% of people expect to work more from home, 20% to cycle and walk more and fly less in the future after the coronavirus crisis. Our findings contribute to the literature on life-events, indicating that certain events in someone's life (e.g. relocating to a new home) could have both immediate and structural behavioural effects (M\u00fcggenburg et al., 2015; Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2012; Schoenduwe et al., 2015) .

An economic recession may lead to higher unemployment rates, affecting both commuting mobility as well as travel budgets of people for non-commuting trips.

            "text": "Secondly, our method relies on people's self-reported experiences and expectations. People's expectations do not always result in actual behavioural intentions in the future (Ajzen, 1991) . These intentions and future behaviour in itself are also influenced by people's ability to change their behaviour irrespective of others. In reality, this ability depends on external factors such as the employer, educational institutions, public transport operators, and others. To what extent people actually change their behaviour and behavioural intention in the future thus remains to be seen. Future measurements are needed to alleviate this concern. This research has several implications for policy makers. For example, many of the observed changes in behaviour would not have been possible without ICT. People resort to digital solutions for grocery shopping or social contacts, or e-conferencing to work from home. However, this increased importance of ICT in daily activities may have some negative effects in light of the so-called digital divide (Selwyn, 2004) . For people who do not have access to these ICT tools or do not own the necessary skills to use them this shift to ICT may result in being unable to participate in these daily activities. In turn, this could lead to some forms of social exclusion (Lucas, 2012) . In addition, the present research showed that experiences with these ICT solutions are not always positive. For social contacts for instance, the group that considers digital social contacts as a full replacement for face-to-face contacts is just as large as the groups that does not. The same goes for home-workers. While the majority of workers indicate to have good digital facilities, there is a smaller group without sufficient digital facilities to work from home. For policy makers it is important to address the issue of digital divide that may become larger with an increasing reliance on ICT and address the apparent shortcomings of available ICT solutions to facilitate behavioural changes that rely on ICT.",

The finding that one in five people expect to walk and cycle more and fly less and over a quarter of home-workers expect to work from home more often in the future after the coronavirus crisis could have positive outcomes in terms of sustainability and health. Nevertheless, people also expect to make as much use of the car and to go back to the same amount of outdoor activities as before the crisis, which would have no positive sustainability impacts in itself. It probably also depends on accommodating policies by national and regional governments (e.g. to stimulate working from home and active mode use when returning to (a new) normal) whether or not behavioural changes will be structural. From a sustainability perspective, the current exogenous shock might be seen as a window of opportunity for policy makers to realise these desired behavioural changes. On the other hand, the governmental urge to restrict public transport use could result in a (structural) shift from public transport to car. Given these uncertainties, it is important for governments to actively follow the changes in mobility behaviour and the impacts of governmental actions.",

Even though people are urged to stay inside of their home, they are still allowed to move around freely as long as they keep a distance of 1.5m to others.

Digital solutions are generally not considered to be a full replacement for meeting people physically. Roughly half of the (previously) employed people faced a change in their work situation such as working less hours or at different times. Furthermore, people and businesses have been able to experience working from their home and remote meetings. Most people report positive experiences with this new way of working.

The use of public transport is impacted the most with a decrease of over 90% of trips. So-called 'roundtrips' gained in popularity. Currently, one in four trips is a roundtrip such as a walking or cycling tour. Besides use of travel modes, attitudes have also changed. A larger share is very positive towards the car, while people's attitudes towards public transport have taken a drastic turn for the worse. This is also reflected in the fact that 88% of people currently prefer individual modes compared to public or shared modes of transport.",

However, our results indicate that the coronavirus crisis might have permanently altered the way we work and travel. More than a quarter of home-workers expect to work from home more often in the future after the coronavirus crisis. For workers who currently have more remote meetings, just over a third expect to continue to hold more remote meetings in the future. Similarly, some structural changes on the way we travel are expected. Roughly 20% of people expect to cycle and walk more in the future. A similar share of people with air travel experience expect to decrease their air travel in the future.

First, there is a need for longitudinal measurements in the future, enabling researchers to measure how expectations, experiences, and behaviour change over time. This allows studying whether people's expectations with regard to changes in activities and travel behaviour will result in actual structural behavioural change after the coronavirus crisis. Second, more in-depth qualitative studies can be applied to better understand how and why people's behaviour is changing because of the coronavirus crisis. Third, the results of this study can be embedded in the broader field of how policies can stimulate desired behavioural shifts (and deter undesired behavioural shifts). For instance, more insight is needed in the role of ICT in behavioural changes. Next to the required ICT developments and policies to facilitate behavioural change, these studies should focus on how it can be ensured that also people without access to the ICT tools or without the required digital skills can still participate in activities that have largely shifted to ICT solutions. Finally, there is a need for international comparison. The coronavirus will have different effects for different countries, based on the amount of cases, governmental policies, and previous behavioural trends. Given the international nature of the coronavirus crisis and the interconnectivity of the globalised world, international studies are needed to further research possible structural effects of this crisis and understand which policies might have caused them.",
