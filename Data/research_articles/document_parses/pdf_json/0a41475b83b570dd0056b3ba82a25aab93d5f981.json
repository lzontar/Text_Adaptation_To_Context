Measurements of vibrations of real buildings are costly and laborious. Therefore the aim of the research is to propose the original numerical algorithm which allows us to predict, with high probability, the negative dynamic impact of traffic-induced vibrations on the examined building. The model has been based on machine learning. Firstly, the experimental tests have been conducted on different buildings using specialized equipment taking into account six factors: distance from the building to the edge of the road, type of surface, condition of road surface, condition of the building, the absorption of soil and the type of vehicle. Then, the numerical algorithm based on machine learning (using support vector machine) has been created. The results of the conducted analysis clearly show that the method can be considered as a good tool for predicting the impact of traffic-induced vibrations on buildings, being characterized by high reliability.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "There a number of different dynamic loads, including the effects of earthquakes, wind, vibrating machines, jumping of spectators, piling works or passing of vehicles, which can induce vibrations of buildings (see [1] [2] [3] for example). Traffic-induced vibrations, even that they are not as severe as vibrations caused by wind or earthquakes [4, 5] , can also lead to major problems. They can cause plaster scratches and cracks, scratches on the structure, structural elements cracking or even collapsing of the building (see [6] ). The harmfulness of vibrations on structural elements is influenced by many factors regarding the road on which vehicles move. The dynamic parameters of the building are also important. Vibration measurements on real structures are labour-intensive and costly projects, and what is important, they are not justified in every case. Nowadays, there are many decision support systems, research tools and computer programs necessary for their application. The problem is to find solutions that are both useful and economical. Therefore, approximate methods are increasingly used. These methods allow the engineering problem to be solved accurately enough and the result is satisfactory, even if it is approximate (for example, see [7] ). An example of this approach is the use of machine learning (ML). An example of this methodology is the support vector machine (SVM). The idea of using ML appeared as early as in 1952, when Arthur Samuel from IBM began building a computer program for training chess players [8] . The concept of ML appeared for the first time in 1983 in publication [9] . The purpose and sense of operation of ML was described by Tom Michael Mitchell in the basic publication regarding ML algorithms [10] . In turn, Chen et al. [11] used SVM to detect burglars. ML was also used in building operation problems. An example is the publication [12] which presents a system based on ML techniques supporting the detection of a threat, for example in the form of a fire, based on the analysis of the image from monitoring. Related works also include the paper [13] aiming to create a model of technical degradation of buildings located in mining areas and subjected to paraseismic tremors. An interesting application can also be found in the publication by Mart\u00ednez-Rego et al. [14] .

It should be noted that vibrations and noise are defined as environmental pollution. A very important factor in analysing the impact of traffic-induced vibrations on buildings is the soil in which the wave propagates. They are two wave parameters (damping and absorption) of significant importance described in [16] . Both of them depend mainly on the type of medium in which the wave propagates. Therefore, the soil impact parameter was also included in this ML model. It is also important to determine the source of vibration, propagation path and indicate the vibration receiver, which can be a structure itself, people or equipment located inside a building.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 155, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 469, "end": 473, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Problem of Traffic-Induced Vibrations"}, {"text": "Special attention should be paid to the possibility of traffic-induced vibrations already during the design phase of building, and also in the exploitation phase.

Therefore, if a building is located closer than the standard indicates, it is recommended to examine the impact of vibrations. However, after performing field tests using specialized equipment, it often appears that there is no immediate danger to the structure. Moreover, carrying out such tests for all buildings located along the road may not be economically justified. Therefore, there is a need to develop effective methods for forecasting impact of trafficinduced vibrations on buildings. The experience and acquired knowledge of experts are the basis of systems and calculation programs. Therefore, the aim of the operation is to create an expert model based on ML which allows us to predict with high probability the threat of negative dynamic impact on the tested building without performing laborious and expensive field measurements.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 193, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Problem of Traffic-Induced Vibrations"}, {"text": "It should be added that vibrations may also have significant impact on people in buildings.

Test results show that the threshold of human vibration perception is lower than the limit, after which damage may occur in the building itself [16] . In European standards (see [17] [18] [19] [20] ), three parameters are described for assessing the impact of vibrations: the corrected value of acceleration or velocity of vibrations in the frequency range 1-80 Hz, spectrum (frequency structure) for effective acceleration or velocity values in 1/3 octave bands and the dose of vibration.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 188, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 189, "end": 192, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 420, "end": 424, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 454, "end": 458, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 459, "end": 463, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 464, "end": 468, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 469, "end": 473, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Problem of Traffic-Induced Vibrations"}, {"text": "The extensive experimental study has been firstly carried out for 11 buildings (see Table 1 ).

The SVM task is to set a separator that will split the data into obvious subsets. The aim is to create a way to classify new data for which the assignment is not known. The SVM method assumes that the input variables are mutually independent and have the same probability distribution. The following input signals have been adopted on the basis of standard [15] and publication [21] : the distance of the building from the road edge (quantitative variable), condition and type of pavement, condition of the building, type of vehicle and absorption of vibrations in the ground (quality variables). Before the final set of parameters has been adopted, different combinations of these parameters have been examined. The output signal has been defined in this way that it contains the information whether there is a risk of negative impact of vibrations on buildings or not. The danger has been determined on the basis of the criteria described in standard [15] . No impact indicates zone I of dynamic influence scale, i.e. no influence on a building. If the algorithm predicts a possible threat, it is an indication for performing in situ measurements, as it may mean that the building falls in zone II-V of dynamic influence scale. The construction of SVM has been based on the principles described in the literature [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Firstly, the database necessary to start the algorithm has been created. 63 samples have been collected, including 33 input data samples by independent own measurements (see chapter 3 and [21] ) and 30 samples based on measurements of other researchers [30, 31] . The input signals have been defined as factors (independent variables) determined during field measurements, i.e. B C -condition of building, B DRdistance from the edge of the building, S A -soil absorption, R S -type of road surface, R C -condition of road surface, V T -type of vehicle. The input vector has therefore been adopted as follows: Two classes as the output signal have been adopted: 0 -no impact of vibrations on the building; 1 -probable impact of vibrations on the building.
