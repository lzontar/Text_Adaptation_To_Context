Given the extremely poor prognosis of critically-ill COVID-19 patients who require mechanical ventilation, particularly the older patients or those with chronic comorbidities, 1,2 it has become imperative to clarify goals of care (GOC) in a timely fashion. The surge of critically ill COVID-19 patients in the emergency department (ED) prompted an increased demand for early identification of GOC and treatment preferences. Early GOC clarification may help avoid using scarce resources for patients who do not want them.",

Similar to Curtis et al., 10 we suggest utilizing informed assent when cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is unlikely to be beneficial and is not consistent with a patient\"s values or goals. However, we believe informed assent can be applied not only to CPR, but also to mechanical ventilation and other medical interventions, provided we assess and confirm the patient and/or family\"s understanding, and create space for objection.",
