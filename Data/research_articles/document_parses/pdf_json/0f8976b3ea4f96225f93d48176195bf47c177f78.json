Editor: Teresa Frisan ABSTRACT Heat-labile enterotoxins (LT) of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are structurally and functionally related to cholera toxin (CT). LT-I toxins are plasmid-encoded and flanked by IS elements, while LT-II toxins of type II ETEC are chromosomally encoded with flanking genes that appear phage related. Here, I determined the complete genomic sequence of the locus for the LT-IIa type strain SA53, and show that the LT-IIa genes are encoded by a 51 239 bp lambdoid prophage integrated at the rac locus, the site of a defective prophage in E. coli K12 strains. Of 50 LT-IIa and LT-IIc, 46 prophages also encode one member of two novel two-gene ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin families that are both related to pertussis toxin, which I named eplBA or ealAB, respectively. The eplBA and ealAB genes are syntenic with the Shiga toxin loci in their lambdoid prophages of the enteric pathogen enterohemorrhagic E. coli. These novel AB 5 toxins show pertussis-toxin-like activity on tissue culture cells, and like pertussis toxin bind to sialic acid containing glycoprotein ligands. Type II ETEC are the first mucosal pathogens known to simultaneously produce two ADP-ribosylating toxins predicted to act on and modulate activity of both stimulatory and inhibitory alpha subunits of host cell heterotrimeric G-proteins.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are the main cause of morbidity and mortality due to diarrhea in travelers to and children under five in the developing world (World Health Organization 2006) , producing a profuse watery diarrhea due mainly to the effect of secreted enterotoxins, either or both of a large multimeric heat-labile toxin or the smaller heat-stable pep-tide toxin. The plasmid-encoded heat-labile enterotoxin (LT-I) of classical ETEC is structurally, functionally and immunologically related to cholera toxin (CT) of Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera (Sack 2011) . A second group of ETEC (type II ETEC) possesses chromosomally-encoded heat-labile enterotoxins (LT-II) that are structurally and functionally related, but immunologically non-cross-reactive to CT and LT-I (Guth et al. 1986 ). Together CT, LT-I and LT-II form the heat-labile enterotoxin family. The chromosomal locus encoding LT-II toxins is currently undefined. Diagnosis of ETEC requires specialized tests not routinely performed in clinical microbiology laboratories (Sj\u00f6ling et al. 2007) , and as LT-II toxins bind different ganglioside receptors and are genetically divergent from LT-I, even these techniques (e.g. GM1-ELISA or PCR) will not detect LT-II strains, and their contribution to diarrheal disease in both humans and animals is currently unknown. Type II ETEC were originally identified by biological assays for enterotoxin activity that was not neutralizable by CT or LT-I antisera (Green et al. 1983) , and have been found in human clinical isolates (Seriwatana et al. 1988) , diseased bovines (Pohl et al. 1989 ) and from foodstuffs such as hamburger and milk (Franco et al. 1991) . Initial studies identified two strains that produced LT-IIa or LT-IIb (Pickett et al. 1989 ) variants. Recently, a third variant (LT-IIc) was described (Nawar et al. 2010 ) in a strain isolated from sick ostriches (Nardi et al. 2005) , and the LT-II family now consists of three related subgroups -LT-IIa, LT-IIb and LT-IIc enterotoxins. The contributions of LT-II toxins to disease has received little study, while initial studies showed that purified LT-IIa did not cause fluid accumulation in rabbit intestinal loops (Holmes, Jobling and Connell 1995) , a recent study showed that purified LT-IIa and to a lesser extent LT-IIb did so in intestinal loops of calves, and that cloned copies of LT-IIa and LT-IIb alone, present in an otherwise non-toxigenic porcine E. coli strain, were capable of causing severe diarrhea and weight loss in a neonatal pig model (Casey et al. 2012 ). The first genomic analysis of a large collection of type II enterotoxin strains (Jobling and Holmes 2012) showed that (i) the prototype LT-IIa and LT-IIb toxin types are rare (found in only 6% and 2% of isolates, respectively), that (ii) six subgroups of LT-IIc toxin genes are found the majority of the type II isolates, and that (iii) all LT-II toxin genes are flanked 5 and 3 by phage-related genes, suggesting that they may be prophage-encoded. All genes immediately 5 of the LT-II genes encode very similar phage lysozymelike proteins (Pei and Grishin 2005) of the glycosyl hydrolase 108 family (Stojkovi\u0107 and Rothman-Denes 2007) , while the immediate 3 phage-related genes are conserved within but differ between the LT-IIa, LT-IIb and LT-IIc families (Jobling and Holmes 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 198, "text": "(World Health Organization 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 586, "end": 597, "text": "(Sack 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 805, "end": 822, "text": "(Guth et al. 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1091, "text": "(Sj\u00f6ling et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1517, "text": "(Green et al. 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1567, "end": 1591, "text": "(Seriwatana et al. 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1628, "text": "(Pohl et al. 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1698, "text": "(Franco et al. 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1791, "text": "(Pickett et al. 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1871, "text": "(Nawar et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1915, "end": 1934, "text": "(Nardi et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2221, "end": 2255, "text": "(Holmes, Jobling and Connell 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2562, "end": 2580, "text": "(Casey et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2664, "end": 2689, "text": "(Jobling and Holmes 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3124, "end": 3146, "text": "(Pei and Grishin 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 3184, "end": 3218, "text": "(Stojkovi\u0107 and Rothman-Denes 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 3342, "end": 3367, "text": "(Jobling and Holmes 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "All members of the heat-labile enterotoxin family are encoded by two genes encoding precursor polypeptides of the enzymatic A and receptor-binding B subunits. These are secreted to the periplasm with concomitant removal of their signal sequences, where they assemble into the latent holotoxin consisting of a single A subunit and a homo-pentameric B subunit. The B pentamers confer specificity on the toxin by binding to specific host cell gangliosides that differ between family members. The first step in activation of the latent holotoxin is proteolytic nicking (by either bacterial or host proteases) of the A subunit within a disulfide-distended loop that generates the A1 and A2 subunits. Reduction of the disulfide bond within the host cell is required for the ultimate release of the catalytically active A1 subunit into the host cell cytoplasm, where it binds and hydrolyzes NAD, transferring the ADP-ribose moiety to an arginine in the stimulatory alpha subunit (Gs\u03b1) of heterotrimeric Gprotein complex. This constitutively activated ADP-ribosylated Gs\u03b1 permanently activates host adenylate cyclase, leading to increased cAMP levels that in intestinal cells ultimately lead to increased chloride secretion and production of profuse watery diarrhea characteristic of cholera and ETEC infections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "G\u03b1 proteins are also targets of another ADP-ribosylating toxin (pertussis toxin, PT) produced by the airway mucosal pathogen, Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough (Carbonetti 2015) . PT is also an A-B toxin with a single enzymatic subunit (S1) and a heteropentameric-binding subunit consisting of S2-S3, S2-S4 and S5 monomers, all encoded by a five gene operon. The B-pentamer preferentially binds to sialic-acidcontaining host cell glycoproteins and delivers the S1 subunit to the target cell. The crystal structure of PT shows that the S1 polypeptide shares a common fold with the A1 subunits of the LT family (Stein et al. 1994b) , and it similarly uses NAD to ADPribosylate a cysteine in the carboxyl terminus of the inhibitory alpha subunit (Gi\u03b1) of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex. This prevents its interaction with G-protein coupled receptors and its direct inhibitory interaction with host adenylate cyclase. These effects lead to inhibition of all signaling via Gi\u03b1-coupled receptors (Katada 2012) and increased levels of cAMP in target cells in response to other stimuli (Hsia et al. 1984; Melsom et al. 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 186, "end": 203, "text": "(Carbonetti 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 635, "end": 655, "text": "(Stein et al. 1994b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1035, "text": "(Katada 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1128, "text": "(Hsia et al. 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1148, "text": "Melsom et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The LT family of toxins and PT each have major effects on the hosts immune response to infection; CT and LT are potent immunomodulators that both suppress an inflammatory response (Fullner Satchell 2003; Glenn, Francis and Danielsen 2009) , enhance colonization (Pierce et al. 1985; Allen, Randolph and Fleckenstein 2006) and modulate cytokine production by epithelial cells (Soriani, Bailey and Hirst 2002) .

Toxin gene expression independent of phage replication is supported by detection of EplBA and LT-II activity in extracts of overnight cultures of TE1 [A38] when these are added to CHO cells in tissue culture (Fig. 2) . CHO cells normally grow as uniform monolayers ( Fig. 2A ), but respond to heat-labile enterotoxins by elongating (Guerrant et al. 1974) and to PT by forming tight clusters (Hewlett et al. 1983) . Cosmid cell extract treated CHO cells grew in tight clusters with elongated morphology, showing both PT-like and LT-II activity (Fig. 2B ). Pre-incubation of extract with toxin-specific rabbit-anti-serum neutralized the toxins and resulted in monolayers that formed clusters only (Fig. 2C , when pre-incubated with anti-LT-IIa), elongated cells only (Fig. 2D , when pre-incubated with anti-EplBA) or normal morphology when pre-incubated with both antisera (Fig. 2E ). This demonstrates that the morphological changes are specific to each toxin; their effects are independent of each other, and that both toxins are naturally produced by cells carrying the cosmid clone. The CHO clustering phenotype is indistinguishable from that seen for CHO cells treated with purified PT ( Fig. 2F ; see also Hewlett et al. 1983 ). Hewlett et al. 1983 also showed that simultaneous addition of PT and CT to CHO cells causes them to both cluster and elongate, indicating that the effect of the two toxins was additive. Additionally, the Hewlett group found that treatment with both PT and CT had a synergis-tic effect on the amount of cAMP produced by intoxicated cells (Hewlett et al. 1982) , and further that treatment with both toxins was required to observe a maximal cAMP response (Hsia et al. 1984) . However, as these two toxins (PT and CT) are produced by different pathogens that colonize distinct mucosal environments (B. pertussis in the lung and Vibrio cholerae in the gut, respectively), this effect was not at the time biologically relevant. Here, I have shown for the first time that an enteric pathogen encodes and can simultaneously produce both types of ADPribosylating toxins that, together, are predicted to completely inactivate G-protein dependent control over cAMP production in target cells, by ADP-ribosylating and constitutively activating the stimulatory Gs\u03b1 subunit (by LT-II toxin) and ADP-ribosylating and inactivating the inhibitory Gi\u03b1 subunit (by PT-like toxins).

It is thus possible that this LT-IIa prophage is now defective, and I have been unsuccessful in detecting plaque formation or Rac phage production from SA53. However, spontaneous excision of the prophage can be detected in some type II ETEC isolates by PCR. Outward-directed primers (RacrhsF3-right arm, and racIntF, left arm) from both ends of the prophage detect circularized phage DNA in stationary phase cultures of several LT-IIc isolates, but not SA53 (LT-IIa) (Fig. 4) . The defective K12 Rac prophage can also excise (Evans, Seeley and Kuempel 1979) , in a process recently found to be regulated by HN-S (Hong, Wang and Wood 2010) , by recombination between direct repeats of 5 -TTGTTCAGGTTGTATTGTTCTTTCTT-3 , that flank the K12 locus and define the att site. Thus, the LT-IIc phages are functional for at least a portion of the lytic pathway, but we do not yet know of conditions that may induce the lytic cycle or if these are capable of replicating and forming functional phage particles.

For comparison, there are few published studies describing Rac-like phages. The Sakai Rac prophage, Sp10 (Asadulghani et al. 2009 ) is reported to be competent for all phage functions except for the repressor which appears to be described as defective only because it lacks an SOS-induction domain.

The major differences between the EalAB-encoding loci occur in the intergenic region between the end of the EalB gene and the start of the first holin gene; the coding sequences are highly conserved (red boxed regions; Fig. S3 , Supporting Information), but the intervening region varies greatly in length and sequence, from 320 bp for IIc1v/IIc5 variants, 284 bp for IIc6 variant down to only 57 bp for the IIa variant locus. The significance of this is unclear. By comparison, all EplA and holin genes are separated by 494 bp, 99%-100% identical for the LT-IIc loci and 87% identical to the LT-IIa loci. Table 2 shows that the particular BA/AB toxin type also correlates closely with LT-II type and origin of isolate. Strikingly, four subgroups of LT-IIc (c1, c2, c3 and c4) isolates are only associated with eplBA genes and constitute two-thirds (33/50) of all LT-II isolates. All LT-IIc1v and the single c6 isolates encode EalAB toxins. While 90% (9/10) of the EalAB-encoding loci are found in isolates of animal origin, 90% (9/10) of human type II ETEC isolates encode EplBA toxins. This tight and non-random linkage between EalAB/EplBA and LT-II type raises the questions as to how the various combinations might have arisen, and what the selective forces are that produce the tight linkage these two toxins. Both toxin loci fit the definitions of morons, as beneficial elements that usually have their own promoters and terminators (Cumby et al. 2012b) . Here, they are inserted between highly conserved Q and terminase genes, and these are potential sites where homologous recombination can occur. The most likely way to generate recombinants is by superinfection, of a type II ETEC isolate with a resident rac prophage, by an active toxin-encoding phage with homologous Q, holin and terminase genes but different EplBA, EalAB or LT-II loci. Relaxed recombination specificity of phage recombination enzymes such as \u03bbred\u03b1\u03b2 or Rac recE/recT gene products (De Paepe et al. 2014 ) drives assortment of phage modules, and can occur even when the resident prophage is defective. Bobay, Touchon and Rocha (2013) finds that 'phages encoding their own recombination machinery have more mosaic genomes resulting from recent recombination events and have more diverse gene repertoires'. Superinfection of stx lysogens by other stx phages has been demonstrated (Fogg et al. 2011) , and in a comparative genomics study of stx phages, Smith concludes that 'recombination events between the host, phages and their remnants within the same infected bacterial cell will continue to drive the evolution of Stx phage variants' (Smith et al. 2012 ). These events have apparently occurred frequently enough in type II ETEC to generate the many combinations of LT-II toxin and Epl/Eal toxin types we find here, and suggest that toxin-encoding Rac phages are or have recently been able to produce infectious particles. The tight linkage of a PT-like toxin with an LT-II toxin within the same prophage indicates that the ability to produce both toxins provides the cell with a currently undetermined selective advantage in nature.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1712, "end": 1732, "text": "(Cumby et al. 2012b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2234, "end": 2255, "text": "(De Paepe et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2354, "end": 2385, "text": "Bobay, Touchon and Rocha (2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2630, "end": 2648, "text": "(Fogg et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2889, "end": 2907, "text": "(Smith et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 238, "end": 245, "text": "Fig. S2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 492, "end": 499, "text": "Fig. S3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 879, "end": 886, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Most EplBA-negative LT-II isolates encode alleles of a second novel PT-like toxin family"}, {"text": "From a collection of 50 type II ETEC isolates, only four produced no PCR product using the Q and holin gene-specific primers.

The single LT-IIb isolate also gave no product, and neither the isolate, strain 41, nor TE1 carrying the cosmid clone, D27, showed clustering activity on CHO cells, indicating that the LT-IIb strain does not produce a PT-like toxin. It does, however encode a lysin gene 5 of the LT-IIb locus (Jobling and Holmes 2012) , indicating LT-IIb may also be encoded by a prophage. To verify this, I determined the prophageencoding sequence of the single available LT-IIb cosmid clone D27; this cosmid appears chimeric (more than one contiguous genomic Sau3AI fragment inserts), and has a 10 kb Sau3AI fragment encoding the LT-IIb locus, joined to \u223c26 kb of unlinked chromosomal DNA (shown graphically in Fig. S4 , Supporting Information). The 10 kb DNA fragment encompasses 5 kb of sequence 5 of the LT-IIb toxin genes, the LT-IIb genes and the remainder of the right arm, including the chromosomal integration site of the prophage.

While the gene order is reversed between the eplBA and ealAB families (as it is for pltBA and artAB), their corresponding A-and B polypeptides are clearly structurally and functionally related. The A subunits of both novel toxins show 66% overall identity with each other, having more conserved amino-terminal regions and more variable carboxyl-terminal halves (Fig. 6) . Together with the A subunits of the other two-gene toxins from Salmonella (ArtAB and PltBA), they share extensive amino acid homology with the enzymatic S1 subunit of PT Fig. S5 , Supporting Information). The more divergent carboxyl termini are likely a function of the need to preserve interaction with their similarly related but quite different B subunits. Crystal structures are available for PltBA (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) (in conjunction with its second enzymatic A subunit, CdtB) and PT (Stein et al. 1994b) . These show that the carboxyl domains of the enzymatic subunits extend into and interact significantly with the pore of the B pentamer. The aminotermini of these catalytic subunits show very similar folds and key catalytic residues are conserved with PT-S1 for all EplA and EalA alleles (Fig. S5 , Supporting Information). Variants of both EplBA and EalAB with glu-to-ala substitutions for the predicted catalytic glutamate residues (E113A and E115A, respectively) in their A polypeptides assemble into holotoxin normally, but these do not intoxicate host cells (data not shown), indicating that their enzymatic function is required to induce the morphological response. In contrast, comparison of each of these A subunit sequences with PltA shows that two enzymatically critical residues (homologs of PT-S1 R13 and H35), that are also conserved in all other A/S1 subunits, are variant in PltA (substituted by T and F, respectively; identified in Fig. 1 and Fig. S5 , Supporting Information). These are likely to affect the catalytic activity of PltA, and it is possible that PltA has devolved into a mainly structural and not catalytic role in Typhi toxin. The critical function of PltA may then be coupling the CdtB toxin protein to the PltB subunit (ligand-binding component) in its unique tripartite (A 2 -B 5 ) toxin complex (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) . All other toxins with S1-like subunits are therefore likely to be functional ADPribosyltransferases, and like PT, modify and inactivate inhibitory G-proteins; this has been proven for ArtAB (Uchida et al. 2009 ).

I then appended a 6-his tag with a (gly-pro) 2 -encoding linker to the carboxyl terminus of EplB, and expressed this gene as an operon with native eplA (see methods). Essentially pure assembled EplBA holotoxin was affinity purified from cell lysates of TE1 [pAEplBgpgpH6EplA] by metal-chelate (Talon) chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. Holotoxin (A + B subunits) eluted first, and consisted of two bands by SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 8 lane 1) , consistent with assembly into a multimeric complex of mature EplA (26 kDa) with tagged EplB-h6 (16 kDa). A second peak consisted of free B subunits ( Fig. 8 lane 2) .

This makes EplBA a bona fide member of the AB 5 family of toxins. Assembly of the single EplB subunit into a pentamer is in agreement with the crystal structure of the tripartite A 2 B 5 Typhi toxin (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) where the CdtB toxin is covalently coupled to PltA (via a disulfide bond), and PltA is non-covalently coupled to a pentamer of PltB subunits. Using a similar strategy, I cloned, expressed and purified his-tagged EalAB holotoxin (see methods).

Similarly, an AB 5 toxin with a related B subunit (SubAB) binds to glycoprotein ligands (Beddoe et al. 2010) , preferentially an \u03b1(2-3)-linked N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Although this sugar does not occur naturally in humans, it is incorporated into and sensitizes human intestinal cells by absorption from dietary foods (Byres et al. 2008 ). Recently, the preferential glycan recognized by the PltB subunit was determined (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) . The EplBA and EalAB toxins also appear to use glycoproteins as ligands, as the glycan-deficient CHO cell line CHO-15B (Brennan et al. 1988 ) is between 333-and 390-fold less susceptible to both toxins than the parent CHO cell line (identical within the limits of the assay) to these cell lines' response to PT (400-fold less susceptible), as determined by morphological assay (Fig. 9) .

Both toxins bind sialated galactose residues, as do PltB (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) and SubB (Byres et al. 2008) . Overall, although they bind unique sets of glycans, half of the top ten glycans for one toxin are also in the top 20 glycans bound by the other toxin. Common among the top glycans for both toxins are terminal Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc units, although Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc Figure 10 .

Y-axis values represent the average relative fluorescence unit signal of bound toxin (200 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ) detected with Alexa488-labeled anti-His antibody. The schematic structure of the most relevant glycans bound (top two glycans for each subunit, first shared glycan-no. 9 for EplB and no. 10 for EalB, and the second Neu5Gc-containing glycan for EalB) for each subunit is shown beneath the panels, along with the specific linkages.

NS, not shown. Terminal sugar is on the left, glycan linkage to the right. linkages appear equally frequently; glycans with fucosylation of the GlcNAc residue are bound with increased affinity for both toxins (compare EplB glycans no. 1 and 5; EalB glycans ranked no. 9 and 27). Both EplB and EalB bind to Neu5Ac alone, ranked no. 20 and 23, respectively. The increased ability of EalB to bind Neu5Gc-containing glycans (that humans do not produce) correlates with the animal origin of the majority of the EalAB-positive type II ETEC isolates, although the ability of dietary Neu5Gc glycans to become functional receptors for SubAB on human intestinal cells (Byres et al. 2008) suggests that this may also happen with EalAB. Importantly, residues involved in ligand binding by the mature SubB subunit (S12, Y78) are conserved in both EplB and EalB. Additionally, EalB (but not EplB) has D8 in common with SubB that is critical for the SubB pentamer ability to bind Neu5Gc (Byres et al. 2008) . However, EplB can still bind Neu5Gc glycans but with apparently lower affinity-four of its top 30 glycans contain Neu5Gc although they rank towards the lower end of this group, whereas EalB has 3 Neu5Gccontaining glycans in its top 15. EplB and EalB appear to be more promiscuous towards the sialic acid group than both PltB and SubB, which are much more specific for Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, respectively. Differences between toxins in their preferred ligands may result in altered patterns of target cell intoxication and likely lead to differences in host response to each of these toxins. This could include differences in immunomodulatory properties with consequences for the infection process or their potential use a novel adjuvants.

Although I have yet to detect production of plaqueforming phage, enterotoxigenicity of type II ETEC can be added to the growing list of virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria that are phage-encoded and may be acquired by lysogenic conversion (Casas and Maloy 2011) . Almost all (46/50) of these LT-II toxin prophages in my collection also encoded one of two novel, two-gene PT-like toxins (EplBA and EalAB) that have homologs in S. enterica prophages found in the Typhi serovar (PltBA, encoded by a degenerate and defective remnant prophage) and in the Typhimurium serovar DT104 phage type lineage (ArtAB, encoded within a functional prophage). The location within the prophage of these dual toxin operons (EplBA or EalAB and LT-IIa/c), like the Shiga toxin genes of EHEC prophages, indicates that their expression is likely to be increased during lytic induction of the prophage, being the first genes to be expressed by Q-directed antitermination that drives synthesis of the late structural and lysis genes of the phage particle. This is the first description of a pathogen producing two ADP-ribosylating toxins that are predicted to target both arms of host cell control over adenylate cyclase, by modifying and constitutively activating the stimulatory G-protein Gs\u03b1 (CT/LT-I/LT-II action) and additionally removing inhibitory control by modifying and inactivating Gi\u03b1 (PT-like action). The extremely tight linkage of LT-II toxins with a PT-like toxin in the vast majority of LT-II isolates strongly implies that this combination is biologically advantageous to the host strain. Simultaneous production of both toxins thus has the potential to synergistically increase cAMP production by intoxicated cells. In addition to affecting cAMP levels in intoxicated cells, both toxins, through their modification of both stimulatory and inhibitory host cell G\u03b1 subunits, are likely, like cholera and PT, to have strong immunomodulatory effects on the host cell mucosal tissue, including both cytokine production by target enterocytes (Soriani, Bailey and Hirst 2002; Wang et al. 2013) and immune responses by the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Elson and Ealding 1984; Queen and Satchell 2013; Mattsson et al. 2014 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 446, "end": 468, "text": "(Casas and Maloy 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2236, "end": 2268, "text": "(Soriani, Bailey and Hirst 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 2269, "end": 2286, "text": "Wang et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 2346, "end": 2370, "text": "(Elson and Ealding 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2371, "end": 2395, "text": "Queen and Satchell 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2396, "end": 2416, "text": "Mattsson et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUDING REMARKS"}, {"text": "This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health grants AI-31940 and AI-14107.
