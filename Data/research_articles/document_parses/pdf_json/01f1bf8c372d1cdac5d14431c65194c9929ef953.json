            "text": "The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been a focus of international attention since its identification in 2012. Epidemiologically it is characterized by sporadic community cases, which are amplified by hospital-based outbreaks. Healthcare facilities in 27 countries from most continents have experienced imported cases, with the most significant outbreak involving 186 cases in Korea. The mortality internationally is 36% and guidance for clinical management has yet to be developed. Most facilities and healthcare providers outside of the Middle East receiving patients have no or little experience in the clinical management of MERS. When a case does occur there is likely little time for a critical appraisal of the literature and putative pharmacological options. We identified published literature on the management of both MERS-CoV and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) through searches of PubMed and WHO and the US CDC websites up to 30 April 2016. A total of 101 publications were retrieved for critical appraisal. Most published literature on therapeutics for MERS are in vitro experiments, animal studies and case reports. Current treatment options for MERS can be categorized as: immunotherapy with virus-specific antibodies in convalescent plasma; polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies produced in vitro or in genetically modified animals; and antiviral agents. The use of any therapeutics in MERS-CoV remains investigational. The therapeutic agents with potential benefits and warranting further investigation include convalescent plasma, interferon-b/ribavirin combination therapy and lopinavir. Corticosteroids, ribavirin monotherapy and mycophenolic acid likely have toxicities that exceed potential benefits.",

Most of the approximately 1700 incident cases to date have been managed in the Middle East. However, this disease has been exported to 27 countries in North America, Asia, Europe and Africa. The majority of these were solitary cases that did not cause secondary spread. In June 2015, Korea experienced the largest outbreak outside of Saudi Arabia with an extended chain of transmission involving multiple generations of cases, including 186 patients and 36 deaths (20%). 1 This demonstrated the potential of MERS-CoV in widespread human-to-human transmission, leading to disruption of health and socio-economic systems.",

            "text": "Anti-coronavirus therapy is challenging to develop. Coronaviruses are biologically diverse and rapidly mutating. Hence, effective agents for one strain, especially those that target replicative mechanisms, may be useless in another strain. Animal studies are logistically and technically difficult as the number of animal models available is limited and only found in designated biosafety level 3 laboratories. There are fundamental differences between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that put in question the basis of applying the evidence from treatment of the former to the latter. Although MERS-CoV is phylogenetically related to the SARS-CoV, there are differences in their biological make-up, pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. In contrast to SARS-CoV, which binds to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors, MERS-CoV binds to the receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4/CD26). 4,5 MERS-CoV in vivo targets a wide variety of cells, including type II alveolar cells, non-ciliated epithelial cells (Clara cells) and endothelial cells, but not ACE-2-expressing ciliated epithelial cells infected by SARS-CoV. 6 MERS-CoV, unlike SARS-CoV, can also infect and replicate in human monocyte-derived macrophages. 7 This increases the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and co-stimulatory molecules leading to a more exaggerated activation of the immune response, including the expression of interleukin-12, interferon-g and chemokines. These differences in receptor usage and susceptibility to type I and type III interferon may account for the differences in disease patterns, organ tropism and virus shedding. 6,8 -10 Current treatment options for MERS can be categorized into immunotherapy with virus-specific antibodies in convalescent plasma, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies produced in vitro and in genetically modified animals, and antiviral agents. Attempts have also been made at repurposing approved pharmaceutical drugs for MERS-CoV treatment. Multiple compounds, including oestrogen receptor and dopamine receptor antagonists, have displayed activity against both MERS-CoV 11 -13 and SARS-CoV 14 in Vero and Huh7 cell models. Considerable data are available, but well-designed clinical trials have yet to be completed because of low case numbers in any one site and the known difficulties of doing trials in outbreak settings.",

Its completion is expected in June 2017. However, the study has been hampered by logistical challenges, local technical capacity and donor supply. 43 A recent communication from the principal investigator of the study revealed that antibody titres in convalescent plasma are too low to produce a therapeutic effect. 38 There were no randomized controlled studies (RCTs) on the utility of convalescent plasma during the SARS outbreaks. One retrospective and four prospective studies on SARS-affected patients undertaken in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan demonstrated earlier discharge, rapid decrease in viraemia and survival benefits. 18,44 -47 Promising outcomes were also observed when delayed administration (median\u00bcday 11) of pentaglobin, an IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparation, led to improved clinical parameters and radiological appearance in 12 severe SARS patients who continued to deteriorate despite corticosteroid and ribavirin therapy. 48 Similarly, during the subsequent 2009 H1N1 outbreak, a prospective cohort study with 93 intensive care patients showed that the use of convalescent plasma was able to reduce respiratory tract viral load, serum cytokine response and mortality. 49 This positive effect on H1N1 patients was further confirmed by a multicentre RCT using hyperimmune IVIG in intensive care patients. 50 Its early administration within 5 days of symptom onset was Review 3341 JAC associated with a lower viral load and reduced mortality. A systematic review and meta-analysis by the University of Nottingham, which included 32 studies of SARS-CoV infection and severe influenza, concluded that there was a statistically significant reduction in mortality when convalescent plasma was administered early, compared with placebo or no therapy. 51 However, the studies were deemed to be low quality and heterogeneous. They lacked control groups and the effects of convalescent plasma or IVIG could not be discerned from the effects of patient comorbidities, stage of illness or other treatments.",

One of these studies investigated the impact of earlier administration of IFN and ribavirin. 82 This study involved 44 mechanically ventilated patients. Twenty-two were given IFN-a2a and ribavirin and the median time to therapy administration was 3 days.

Another retrospective study showed that there was no significant difference in outcomes between patients who were given combinations of ribavirin with IFN-a2a or IFN-b1a. 82 The mortality in patients who received IFN-a2a was 85% (11/13) compared with 64% (7/11) in those who received IFN-b1a (P\u00bc0.24).",

            "text": "Corticosteroids were widely used in SARS due to their antiinflammatory effects. 74,101,130 -136 Most of these cohorts were treated simultaneously with ribavirin. However, the potential local and systemic immunosuppression by corticosteroids is concerning. 137, 138 One RCT concluded that the administration of corticosteroids might enhance viral replication in the lung, as shown by higher plasma SARS-CoV viral load and slower serum viral clearance in weeks 2 -3 of illness in patients given hydrocortisone (n\u00bc10) than in those given normal saline (n\u00bc 7) in the early phase of the disease. 139 There were similar findings when corticosteroids were tested in H1N1 influenza-affected patients. 140 A retrospective cohort study showed that the use of corticosteroids was associated with increased risks of prolonged lower respiratory tract viral replication, nosocomial infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia and higher mortality. 140 Many patients with severe MERS were treated with systemic high-dose corticosteroids, which were intended to reverse the progression of respiratory distress and to prevent lung fibrosis. This has not proven to be successful. 141 Corticosteroids do not improve longer-term outcomes in ARDS and their routine use is not recommended 142 In addition, corticosteroids were also associated with osteonecrosis, delirium and aspergillosis. 143 -146 Discussion It is challenging to select appropriate pharmacological treatments when faced with a novel infection and inconclusive data drawn from many sources. Despite discovering a fairly large number of repurposed drugs that have activities against MERS-CoV, few have fulfilled their potential in clinical settings. Most of these agents have drawbacks, either in having high EC 50 /C max ratios at clinical dosages or immunosuppressive side effects, which discouraged further clinical trials. The sporadic epidemiology has also made patient recruitment into clinical trials difficult. The use of any therapeutics in MERS-CoV remains investigational. Data extrapolated from use in SARS, either in vitro or clinically, are, at best, of speculative value.",

            "text": "Convalescent plasma, IFN with or without ribavirin, and lopinavir/ ritonavir are most likely to be beneficial and should be further evaluated. There are retrospective and non-randomized interventional data obtained during the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks showing that convalescent plasma brought about a rapid decrease in viraemia and reduced mortality. 18,43 -51 Treatment with convalescent plasma is likely to be more effective when there is significant viraemia, hence early administration is key. 51,52 A prospective human study investigating the use of convalescent plasma in MERS is ongoing, but is facing logistical and recruitment challenges. Plasma products and immunoglobulins vary geographically and will likewise vary in efficacy against MERS. 55 -57 Given the small number of MERS patients and the significant mortality of this infection, there may not be sufficient convalescent sera for this to be a scalable option, particularly outside of the Middle East. Cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV antibodies has been observed but is unlikely to be useful therapeutically. 22 mAbs could offer a useful alternative as they are rapidly reproducible and have so far shown high potency and specificity. However, further development is likely to be tempered by the challenges of licensing and full-scale production at affordable costs for an undefined population. IFN and ribavirin with or without lopinavir/ritonavir is the most reported therapy for MERS. Although non-human primate studies showed that combination treatment of IFN with ribavirin and/or lopinavir resulted in reduced virus replication, moderated host response and improved clinical outcome, 72,73 five small-scale retrospective studies in critically ill patients failed to show mortality benefits. 80 -84 This discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo findings may be related to the high EC 50 /C max ratios of these drugs and delays in drug administration. 13,70 Early drug administration is essential in MERS patients as they have a more rapid progression to death than SARS patients. 147 Ribavirin should be used with caution as in vitro studies for MERS-CoV required a high serum concentration for inhibition. 70 , 72 The dose of ribavirin can be reduced when used together with IFN-a2b 70 but it is associated with multiple side effects including haemolysis, electrolyte imbalances and liver impairment, which can occur in up to 61% of treated patients. 102 Lopinavir has been shown in limited observational studies to result in lower mortality and less progression to ARDS in SARS. 89, 90 Its use has been reported in one MERS patient, who cleared viraemia 2 days after administration of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and IFN-a2a. 76 Some have suggested that antiviral administration should be considered as soon as possible after diagnosis 148 based on limited clinical evidence that earlier administration of IFN and ribavirin resulted in a trend towards improved survival in MERS. 83 Similarly in SARS, therapeutic benefit was observed when ribavirin was given earlier than 6 -14 days after the onset of symptoms. 91, 149 Corticosteroids, ribavirin monotherapy and mycophenolic acid are likely to cause more harm than benefit. Corticosteroids cause local and systemic immunosuppression. Their administration has been associated with higher plasma viral load, slower viral clearance and higher mortality in both SARS and H1N1. 138, 139 Furthermore, they have not been shown to improve longer-term outcomes in ARDS. 142 Ribavirin should not be considered for use as a monotherapy due to its poor side effect profile and the high dosage required to inhibit MERS-CoV. 70, 72 It has not been shown to be effective in MERS. In SARS, most of the clinical evidence on ribavirin was deemed inconclusive. 91 There are no clinical data on the efficacy of mycophenolic acid in SARS or MERS. However, it led to severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads in an animal model. 73 Review 3345 JAC While animal to human transmission of MERS CoV continues in the Middle East, it is likely that infected individuals will continue to export the illness to countries with minimal or no experience of dealing with it. Understanding the value and risks of the many treatment options is needed when urgently selecting a therapeutic regimen, especially during what will necessarily be a stressful and 'public' period for any host country and institution. The medical team will need to make decisions based on the body of available information, which gives anything but clear direction. Treatments will need to be applied adhering to research treatment protocols and systematic data collection. Meanwhile, as clinical researchers we simply must improve our ability to undertake multicentre, multinational RCTs in outbreak settings, particularly for emerging pathogens.",

A heterogeneous range of treatments is used in MERS patients.
