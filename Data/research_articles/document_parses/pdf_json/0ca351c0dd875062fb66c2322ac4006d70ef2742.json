The current study assesses the moderating influence of social support on the association between economic abuse (EA) and economic hardship. Female participants (n = 435) were recruited to participate in a web-based survey which included standardized measures of EA, other forms of IPV, domains of social support, and economic hardship. Analysis included bivariate and multivariate regression with an investigation into interaction effects.Experiencing EA was significantly correlated with economic hardship, even with extent of physical and emotional IPV controlled. Both tangible and appraisal support had significant negative association with extent of material hardship. Significant interactions between forms of social support and economic abuse were observed. For those at high levels of economic abuse, support had less influence on economic hardship. A mix of direct economic aid, advocacy, education and support could provide a blueprint for addressing the economic hardship experiences of community-dwelling survivors of economic abuse. A comprehensive response to EA requires interventions aimed directly at economically controlling and exploitative tactics, including credit building, individual economic advocacy, and education. Interventions that seek to enhance survivors' access to social support may be necessary but not sufficient to buffer the impacts of violence on survivors' economic outcomes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a worldwide epidemic that impacts at least one in four (27.4%) women (Smith et al. 2017 ). The consequences of economic abuse at the hands of an intimate partner are far-reaching and long lasting. The monetary costs of IPV include $5.8 billion annually in lost productivity, physical, and mental health care costs, along with expenditures for legal and court costs (Max et al. 2004 ). Survivors of IPV lose approximately 8 million days of work per year, the economic equivalent of 32,000 full-time jobs (NCIPC 2003) . IPV also creates serious barriers to establishing or maintaining economic independence for survivors. These barriers are all the more challenging because women cite economic dependence on their abusive partner as a primary limiting factor in establishing safety outside of an abusive relationship (Adams et al. 2013; Tolman and Rosen 2001) . While the link between IPV and economic insecurity is well established, the pathways that feed this association are less explored. The current study seeks to expand the knowledge in this area by assessing the moderating influence of social support on the association between economic forms of abuse and economic hardship in a community-based sample of women.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 104, "end": 122, "text": "(Smith et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 400, "end": 416, "text": "(Max et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 538, "end": 550, "text": "(NCIPC 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 850, "end": 869, "text": "(Adams et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 870, "end": 892, "text": "Tolman and Rosen 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Scholars have identified specific batterer behaviors aimed at sabotaging economic efforts and maintaining economic power and control as a distinct type of IPV (Adams et al. 2013; Stylianou 2018a) . Evidence of unique consequences and specific patterns of behavior have led scholars to call for economic abuse (EA) to be considered as a separate form of abuse deserving specific attention to its dynamics, patterns, and impacts (Adams et al. 2008; Postmus et al. 2012 Postmus et al. , 2018 Stylianou et al. 2013) . EA is comprised of tactics that hinder economic self-sufficiency and harm economic self-efficacy through financial exploitation, economic control, and employment sabotage (Adams et al. 2008; Postmus et al. 2012; Weaver et al. 2009 ). These include preventing or limiting work or school hours, stealing income or cash gifts, harassment at work or school, damaging credit history, and dominating family finances by demanding receipts, preventing access to money, or making unilateral decisions (Adams et al. 2008; Stylianou 2018a; Moe and Bell 2004; Sanders 2015; Voth Schrag et al. 2018; Weaver et al. 2009 ). These behaviors are linked to employment and housing instability, increased use of public assistance, greater material hardship, and increased economic dependence on abusive partners for financial stability (Adams et al. 2013; Goodman et al. 2009; Voth Schrag 2016) . Economic abuse has also been shown to impact the health and mental health of victims of IPV. EA has been linked with negative health outcomes such as gastrointestinal syndromes, psychosomatic symptoms, pelvic problems, and psychological problems, as well as mental health impacts including increased risk of depression (Stockl and Penhale 2015; Stylianou 2018b; Voth Schrag 2016) .

Even those with higher incomes are at risk of economic hardship in the face of IPV.

In other words, social support may be protective against material hardship for these individuals.

However, previous studies have demonstrated that the social isolation that accompanies IPV can be a threat to these networks, breaking down access to resources and potentially disrupting the protective effect of social support (Lanier and Maume 2009; Sylaska and Edwards 2014) . For service providers, these data suggest the importance of supporting survivors in identifying strategies for safely maintaining and building social supports and for developing programs that can provide some of the sorts of tangible resources that can decrease survivors' experiences of material hardship. These data also remind us that services which provide advice or knowledge may be necessary but not sufficient to address the material hardship experiences of IPV survivors, especially those for whom EA is a major component of their IPV experience. Financial empowerment programs like the Moving Ahead Through Financial Management curriculum have proven effective in support of the economic self-efficacy of survivors, which could enhance their ability to address the economic consequences of EA (Hetling et al. 2016) . The current findings suggest that it could be useful to compliment these programs with efforts specifically aimed at increasing survivors' safe and secure access to resources which can disrupt material hardship experiences. One such intervention is economic advocacy, which attempts to account for survivors' material and financial needs in the context of planning for safety from abuse (VonDeLinde 2016). It requires advocates to understand the complexities of credit, debt, banking, taxation, and saving, along with how to connect survivors with resources, make change at systemic levels, and explore unconventional routes for enhancing economic well-being (VonDeLinde 2016). Some of these routes could include evidence based interventions such as Individual Development Accounts, housing first programs, and utility assistance. These programs can complement financial education and advocacy and increase survivors' access to tangible resources in order to buffer the impact of EA on their overall economic stability and well-being (Baker et al. 2003; Sanders 2015; Sanders and Schnabel 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 368, "end": 391, "text": "(Lanier and Maume 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 392, "end": 417, "text": "Sylaska and Edwards 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1243, "text": "(Hetling et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2280, "end": 2299, "text": "(Baker et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2300, "end": 2313, "text": "Sanders 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2314, "end": 2340, "text": "Sanders and Schnabel 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications for Working with Survivors"}, {"text": "The literature on survivors' experiences with EA provides an important caution for practitioners seeking to develop such programs. Interviews and surveys with survivors reveal a wide array of economically abusive tactics used by abusive partners, including stealing or controlling access to cash and inkind material assistance (Postmus et al. 2015; Sanders 2015) . Service providers can address this challenge to survivors' economic power by using a Survivor Defined Advocacy framework, which takes an individualized approach to work with each survivor, considering their own unique combination of risks and opportunities (Davies and Lyon 2014) . Survivor centered economic advocacy (SCEA) provides a helpful framework for the integration of tangible supports into an individualized and survivor specific safety plan. As defined by VonDeLinde (2016), SCEA is: an alliance between survivors and advocates that addresses both the physical safety and economic safety needs of survivors through reviewing and developing creative strategies on the survivor's current, past, and future priorities. SCEA builds on the survivor's strengths and uses the advocates knowledge and experience to enhance the survivor's comprehensive safety plan. (2016, p. 2) Limitations A number of methodological limitations should be considered when weighing the voracity of the findings of the current study. First, a major limitation of this work is that the data are cross-sectional and thus unable to measure change over time (Kumar 2005) . Theoretically informed assumptions about causality were built into the specification of the moderation model, but with cross-sectional data it is impossible to control for reciprocal relationships between constructs. Thus, the current study should be seen as a preliminary assessment of the role of social support in buffering the impact of EA on economic hardship, and serve as justification for further longitudinal evaluation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 327, "end": 348, "text": "(Postmus et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 349, "end": 362, "text": "Sanders 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 622, "end": 644, "text": "(Davies and Lyon 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1245, "text": "(2016, p. 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1515, "text": "(Kumar 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications for Working with Survivors"}, {"text": "The study also fails to capture a number of potentially important vectors influencing the relationship between abuse and material hardship.

This concern is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that, when demographics of survey respondents are compared with the study population on age, part vs. full time status, and race, the survey respondents are similar to the overall student body of the four campuses.
