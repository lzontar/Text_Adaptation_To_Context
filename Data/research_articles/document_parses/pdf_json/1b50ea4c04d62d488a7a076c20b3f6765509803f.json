Consequently, the epidemic turns into the great pandemic and by end of March half of the world population was under some form of lockdown (Tosepu et al., 2020) . As of May 25, 2020, the total no of COVID-19 cases surpassed 5.5 million globally, with total deaths tolls more than 345,160 (Corona Tracker, 2020). As countries went into lockdown the industrial activities shut down globally. Among many other sectors, transport is the hardest hit sector due to lockdown. Road and air transport came to halt as people are not allowed or hesitate to travel. According to the report, air travel dropped by 96% due to lowest in 75 years (CNN, 2020). Furthermore, not only the transport sector but also industrial and manufacturing sector is heavily affected by the pandemic. Global oil demand declined drastically and prices cut down sharply, as industrial and transport sectors came to halt worldwide.

Independent estimates indicate that electricity generation for India was down about 10% and 25% in March and April 2020, respectively, as compared to March and April 2019. One exception is in southern India which could be related to increased thermal power generation that came online before the stay-at-home order. However, there was not a similar increase in NO 2 , so possibly coal with higher sulfur content was used in 2020 relative to 2019 without a significant increase in coal consumed. NO 2 is primarily emitted from fossil fuel use. The images show that widespread decreases (~30-60%) in NO 2 levels have occurred over most of South Asia. The highest NO 2 levels are in eastern India and are primarily associated with electricity generation. (Aura 2020). NASA's Air Quality group is regularly producing images from data collected from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument aboard the Aura satellite showing how one air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), is changing.

As a consequence, fewer fossil fuels are being consumed and, subsequently, there is less air pollution (e.g., nitrogen dioxide, NO 2 , as shown in previous OMI images, Fig. 1b This positive impact on the environment may be temporary but governments and individuals should learn from this lockdown on how to reduce pollution on a long term basis. (Yunus et. al. ) attempted to understand the effect of COVID-19 spread in a hydrosphere using remote sensing data products. They have selected one of the severely polluted freshwater lakes in India to evaluate the impact of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 spread on water quality. The analysis of SPM concentrations in Vembanad lake based on the Landsat-8 OLI data revealed that the concentrations during the lockdown period were lower than those in the pre-lockdown period by 15.9% on average (\u221210.3%-36.4%). The decrease was observed in 18 out of 20 zones of the lake. Eleven of the zones showed that the concentration was the lowest in April of 2013-2020.",

Around 10% of toxic load comes from industries that constitute around 700 MLD per day discharge in the Ganga river as per the report of Singhal and Mato. It is estimated that in the Ganga river around 6,500-6,700 million liters per day (MLD) in its UP stretch were discharged and 30 percent of the total BOD load was due to industries along the river, which include 130-150 tons per day(CPCB). More than 80 percent of pollution in the Ganga is due to domestic sewage from surrounding towns and villages. The rest is contributed by industrial waste. This is also the fact that the surface water quality of i.e Ganga river and Yamuna river improved drastically in the past few months. The industries were closed down after lockdown 1, Lockdown 2 and Lockdown 3 in India and the majority of the industrial effluent which were discharged in these rivers were also stopped. The water quality of all the major river of India has been improved due to shut down of industries (Singhal and Mato 2020). An assessment of Ganga water quality at Rishikesh was carried.

The ozone layer acts as a natural sunscreen and plays a very important function by absorbing the harmful U-V rays from the sun. Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are gases such as chlorine and/or bromine which breaks the ozone layer in the stratosphere. Various ODS are chloroflurocarbon (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFCs). Methyl chloride and various halones. These gases are transported into the upper atmosphere. By the reaction with UV sunlight, these gases form chlorine and bromine and they are responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer. The international community signed the Montreal Protocol on substances about the depletion of the ozone layer, 30 years ago. According to the protocol, the consumption and production of ozonedepleting compounds should be regulated. By banning chlorine-containing synthetic compounds the rate of depletion decline and scientists expect to recover back to the 1980 level up to 2070.As per the scientific data of 2018, the stratosphere recovered at the rate of 1-3% per decade since 2000. After the lockdown began on Jan 23, the particulate matter pollution decreased by an average of 35% and NO 2 decreased by an average of 60%. At the same period, scientists found the average surface ozone concentration increased by a factor of 1.5-2. Emission of ozonedepleting substances are also natural or man-made. All man-made emission is controlled because of lockdown during COVID-19. Production and consumption of ODS are also reduced. The World meteorological Organization (WMO) states that economic activity has been limited during COVID-19 which results in a decline in CO 2 emission. In 2019, As per NASA and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 12 hole was ever seen in the ozone layer over the arctic has been closed. Although lockdown is surely showing the prominent sign of nature balance restoration of the ozone layer is not related to COVID-19. Scientist of Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Services (CAMS) reported that is because of strong and long-lived polar vertex and not related to change to air quality.Fig. 2a and 2b.
