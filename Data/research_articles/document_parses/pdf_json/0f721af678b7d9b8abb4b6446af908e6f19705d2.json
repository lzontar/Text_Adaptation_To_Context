The death event occurred more quickly among elderly patients ( We also performed a multivariate logistic regression model using age, underlying disease status, and the baseline T lymphocyte subsets test as the predictors to predict the patient outcome (death or hospital discharge). The significant predictors are age (OR 1\u00b705, p 0\u00b704), underlying disease status (OR 3\u00b742, p 0\u00b702), Helper T cells on the log scale (OR 0\u00b722, p 0\u00b700), and TH/TS on the log scale (OR 4\u00b780, p 0\u00b700).

In order for our findings to be more applicable for public health workers fighting at the frontline, we have developed an interactive web data visualization tool to implement the algorithm and made it accessible for the world at the following web address: https://rpubs.com/mindyfang/covid19. We did not use other lab tests such as the regular blood test items in our analysis because they are less differentiative than the T cell subset measures; and 3. We hope our interactive web tool could be utilized for quick use, therefore keeping as few input items as needed seems to be a more practical choice. Figure 6b shows the k-means clustering result using the Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital data. After multi-dimensional data transformation, the algorithm separates the death group and the discharged group as shown in the graph. A proportion of the discharged cases had similar profiles with the death cases, which had made it difficult for the algorithm to differentiate them apart. However, by using this algorithm, it is possible to identify a large number of patients with relatively good prognosis.",

K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning method, enabling us to find and analyze the intrinsic underlying patient subgroups without any pre-defined subgroup labels. In real-world scenarios, clustering is a widely used technique for customer segmentation17 .The variables used in the k-means clustering included age, underlying disease status, Helper T cells (log scale), Suppressor T cells (log scale), and the Helper T cells and Suppressor T cells ratio (log scale)for the following reasons: 1. Age, underlying disease status, Helper T cells, and TH/TS were significant predictors in our multivariate logistic regression model. Although Suppressor T cells was not statistically significant, it was used in the TH/TS ratio. In fact a principal component analysis18 showed that all of the selected five indexes carry certain proportions of independent information (Figure 6a); 2.",
