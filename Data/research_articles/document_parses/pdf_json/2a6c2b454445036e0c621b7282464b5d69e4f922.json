            "text": "Cell-to-cell movement is a crucial step in plant virus infection. In many viruses, the movement function is secured by specific virus-encoded proteins. Amino acid sequence comparisons of these proteins revealed a vast superfamily containing a conserved sequence motif that may comprise a hydrophobic interaction domain. This superfamily combines proteins of viruses belonging to all principal groups of positive-strand RNA viruses, as well as singlestranded DNA containing geminiviruses, double-stranded DNA-containing pararetroviruses (caulimoviruses and badnaviruses), and tospoviruses that have negative-strand RNA genomes with two ambisense segments. In several groups of positive-strand RNA viruses, the movement function is provided by the proteins encoded by the so-called triple gene block including two putative small membrane-associated proteins and a putative RNA helicase. A distinct type of movement proteins with very high content of proline is found in tymoviruses. It is concluded that classification of movement proteins based on comparison of their amino acid sequences does not correlate with the type of genome nucleic acid or with grouping of viruses based on phylogenetic analysis of replicative proteins or with the virus host range. Recombination between unrelated or distantly related viruses could have played a major role in the evolution of the movement function. Limited sequence similarities were observed between i) movement proteins of dianthoviruses and the MIP family of cellular integral membrane proteins, and ii) between movement proteins of bromoviruses and cucumoviruses and M 1 protein of influenza viruses which is involved in nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins. It is hypothesized that all movement proteins 240 A.R. Mushegian and E. V. Koonin of plant viruses may mediate hydrophobic interactions between viral and cellular macromolecules.",

            "text": "It is generally accepted that plant viruses exploit plasmodesmata to move from initially infected cells, which are usually negligible in amount, into neighbouring healthy cells. Without cell-to-cell movement productive virus infection is not established. Also it is known that specific movement proteins encoded by virus genomes are essential for cell-to-cell spread. Frequently, a plant virus protein is referred to as movement protein if i) it is not a capsid protein and ii) disruption of the coding sequence of this protein abolishes infection in whole plants but has no effect on virus replication in protoplasts. Putative movement proteins have been identified in this manner in about 15 different plant virus groups (see [4, 19, 40] for recent reviews). In some cases, additional virus proteins are also required for movement, e.g. coat protein [13, 52, 58] or a specific segment in a replication protein [55] , but these phenomena are not universal. On the other hand, a specific movement protein or at least movement domain is thought to be present in all viruses that are able to spread from cell to cell [4] .",

Movement protein of TRV, the 29 kDa protein, shares high sequence similarity with TMV movement protein, and both proteins are considered to be functionally very similar. Simultaneous injection of virus and fluorescent tracers into cells of leaf trichomes allowed to observe movement of the labels under the conditions when the virus itself was known to move in the same cells. It has been shown that FITC-labelled dextran (Mr 4.4kDa) moved from cell to cell only in TRVinfected cells and synchronously with the virus. However, Lucifer Yellow-labelled dextran (Mr 10 kDa) was excluded from plasmodesmatal movement even in infected cells. Thus, certain molecules with the dimensions resembling the smallest of the known RNPs did not move under conditions when virus RNPs readily moved. Apparently, either an extremely thin virus-specific RNP should be postulated (see below), or it might be concluded that slight increase in plasmodesmatal permeability induced by movement proteins hints at some important circumstances but is not sufficient to explain celt-to-cell movement of the virus genome.",

However, is should not be forgotten that virus RNAs in vivo are associated with proteins, as revealed for TMV-specific RNAs [22] ; it is thought that such an association is maintained throughout the whole life of the RNPs in the cell; a mechanism of stripping virus RNA from these proteins has not yet been proposed. Also, as binding of movement proteins to RNA is thought not to be sequence-specific [14, 17] , it could be anticipated that the majority of movement protein will bind to cellular RNAs, which in the case of TMV infection are in excess over virus RNAs at the time when 30 kD protein is transiently expressed [18] . The \"ss nucleic acid-binding\" model, therefore, has to be modified to deal with these difficulties.",

            "text": "Using the BLAST program [3] , statistically highly significant similarities were observed only between proteins of viruses belonging to a single group or two closely related groups. Further comparisons were done using programs MA-CAW [53 a] and OPTAL [27] to generate multiple alignments according to the progressive alignment strategy [21] , i.e. starting with pairs of most closely related sequences and proceeding to incorporate more and more distant ones. It was demonstrated that movement proteins of viruses belonging to 17 groups contain a weak but confidently identified conserved motif consisting of approximately 30 amino acid residues (Fig. 1) . This motif includes a nearly invariant aspartic acid residue (replaced by asparagine in dianthoviruses and ilarviruses) preceded by a region enriched in hydrophobic and nonpolar residues. In some of the movement proteins this region was predicted to form a transmembrane helix using the algorithm of Rao and Argos ( [50] , data not shown; see also discussion below). Remarkably, this conserved motif unites viruses with single-stranded DNA genomes (geminiviruses of group II), pararetroviruses with double-stranded DNA genomes (caulimoviruses and badnaviruses), negative-strand RNA viruses with ambisense genome segments (tospoviruses), and numerous groups of positive-strand RNA viruses. Among the latter, all the three major phylogenetically defined divisions [31, 34] are represented, namely ruN-like viruses (tobamoviruses, tobraviruses, cucumoviruses, bromoviruses, ilarviruses, capilloviruses, furoviruses, raspberry bushy dwarf virus), picornalike viruses (comoviruses, parsnip yellow fleck virus, pea enation mosaic virus), and flavi-like viruses (dianthoviruses and tombusviruses). Several groups of movement proteins showed significant similarity on longer sequence stretches. In Fig. 2 we show the amino acid sequence alignments for four of these groups, delineation of which included identification of new putative movement proteins. Such new identifications are: i) 38 kDa protein of apple stem grooving virus, which is related to the putative movement proteins of the other capilloviruses, namely apple chlorotic leaf spot virus and potato virus T (Fig. 2 a) ; ii) 37 kDa protein of soil-borne wheat mosaic furovirus related to the movement proteins ofdianthoviruses (Fig. 2 b) ; iii) 27 kDa protein of pea enation mosaic virus and 21 kDa protein of tombusviruses related to the movement proteins of bromoviruses and cucumoviruses (Fig. 2 c) ; and iv) NSm protein of Fig. 2 . Amino acid sequence alignments for groups of proteins including newly identified putative movement proteins. For each group of boundaries of the conserved segments were determined using the MACAW program and the alignment itself was constructed hierarchically using the OPTAL program. In the consensus U indicates a bulky aliphatic residue (I, L, V, or M), a indicates an aromatic residue (F, I7, or W) & indicates a bulky hydrophobic residue (aliphatic or aromatic) and x indicates any residue. The conserved motif of the \"30 K superfamily\" is highlighted by bold typing, a Putative movement proteins of capilloviruses. ACLSV Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus; PVT potato virus T; ASGV apple stem grooving virus; b movement protein of red clover necrotic mosaic dianthovirus (RCNMV), putative movement proteins of raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBD V) and soil-borne wheat mosaic furovirus (SB WMV); e movement proteins of cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV) and brome mosaic bromovirus (BMV), putative movement proteins of pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) and cucumber necrosis tombusvirus (CNV); the similarity between 21 kDa proteins of tombusviruses and movement proteins of bromoviruses and cucumoviruses has been independently reported by U. Melcher (pers. comm.); d putative movement proteins of caulimoviruses, badnaviruses, parsnip yellow fleck virus, and tomato spotted wilt tospovirus; asterisks show identical residues and colons show similar residues between the sequences of PYFV and FMV, and CoYMV and TSWV tospoviruses and the N-terminal domain of the parsnip yellow fleck virus polyprotein related to the putative movement proteins of caulimoviruses and badnaviruses (Fig. 2 d; the similarity between caulimovirus movement proteins and N-terminal domains of badnavirus polyproteins was noted by U. Melcher and cited in [8] ). Even among these smaller groups, the latter three brought together proteins of very different viruses. Group iv) is particularly notable in that it compiles proteins of a positive-strand RNA virus, negative-strand (ambisense) RNA viruses, and DNA-containing pararetroviruses. Curiously, the array of domains, namely N-movement domain-capsid protein(s)-replicative domains-C in the polyproteins of such seemingly unrelated viruses as parsnip yellow fleck virus and the badnaviruses is very similar. A relevant observation from our previous work is the relationship between movement proteins of two component geminiviruses (BL1/BC1) with those of tobamoviruses and tobraviruses [33] . All the proteins containing the conserved motifs shown in Fig. 1 should be considered a single vast, and highly diverged superfamily of plant virus movement proteins. We would like to coin the nickname \"30 K superfamily\", after the most thoroughly studied movement protein of tobamoviruses, and also because most of the proteins of this superfamily have the size around this value (Fig. 1 a) .",

It has been demonstrated that disruption of any of the triple block genes abolished the cell-to-cell movement of hordeiviruses, potexviruses and BNYVV [5 a, 25 a, 49 a]. The putative helicases in the triple block comprise a distinct group within superfamily I of DNA and RNA helicases and contain several unusual amino acid substitutions in the conserved helicase motifs [26, 34] . Unlike the genes coding for the proteins of the \"30 K superfamily\", the triple block is found only in positive-strand RNA viruses. Carmoviruses and necroviruses encode a pair of small proteins, one of which is predicted to be an integral membrane protein. It has been shown that disruption of either of these genes precluded cell-to-cell movement of turnip crinkle carmovirus [28] . These two genes perhaps may be considered a \"truncated triple block\" although it was hard to demonstrate this at the level of sequence comparison due to the small size of the hydrophobic proteins.",

Also, we were unable to notice any correlation between grouping of movement proteins and biological properties of the viruses encoding these proteins (e.g. host ranges). Recombination between unrelated or distantly related viruses could have played a major role in the evolution of the movement function. This is clearly the preferential explanation for situations when related movement proteins are found in viruses with different type of genome nucleic acid (e.g. the striking similarity between the putative movement proteins of caulimo/badnaviruses Fig. 2 d) . In some cases recombinational transfer of movement protein genes appears very likely also between remote groups of positive-strand RNA viruses (e.g. dianthoviruses and soil borne wheat mosaic furovirus; Fig. 2 c) .",

In animal kingdom, gap junctions are important for electrical coupling of cells in various tissues [51] . Interestingly, permeability of both plasmodesmata and gap junctions for some low molecular weight tracer dyes is down-regulated by activation of protein kinase C [5] .

            "text": "A case of movement of a nucleoprotein through a channel in a membrane is represented by nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of RNPs (reviewed in [38, 45] ). Among the features of the nucleocytoplasmic export of cellular RNAs revealed thus far, several might be relevant to the mechanisms of movement of plant virus genomes. In particular, it has been shown that at all stages of nucleocytoplasmic export, mRNA is attached to specific protein frameworks, being transferred from nucleoskeleton to nuclear pore complex to cytoplasm [12] ; specific proteins in mRNP are thought to chaperone association-dissociation of the mRNA to and from these frameworks [1, 53] . Components of mRNP activate enzymes within the nuclear pore complex which are essential for energydependent translocation of RNP through nuclear pore; two of these enzymatic activities are ATPase and RNA helicase [53] . It is tempting to speculate that mechanistic analogies may exist between the nucleocytoplasmic transport of cellular RNPs and intracellular and/or intercellular movement of viral RNPs. More specifically, the parallel between the RNA helicase in the nuclear pore and the putative viral RNA helicase in the triple block that is involved in virus movement (see above) certainly is provocative. It should be noted that plant viruses, which undergo some stages in the nucleus of the infected cells (i.e. pararetroviruses and geminiviruses), should be able to perform both nucleocytoplasmic movement and cell-to-cell movement of their genomes; one may wonder to what extent these two processes are similar and whether movement proteins are involved in both of them.",

            "text": "Comparison of the amino acid sequences of dianthovirus movement proteins with amino acid sequence databases revealed a marginally significant but provocative similarity with membrane proteins of the MIP family [48] . With the BLAST score of 67 and probability of random matching of 0.23, the similarity of the movement protein of RCNMV with tonoplast membrane protein TIP 1 from Arabidopsis was the highest in the entire database except for the similarities with the homologous proteins of the other dianthoviruses. Analysis of the multiple alignment of the dianthovirus movement proteins with a representative set of the MIP proteins (Fig. 4) showed that the region of similarity included the conserved motif of the \"30 K superfamily\" described above and the characteristic conserved motif of the MIP family [48] . Each of these motifs consisted of a putative transmembrane helix succeeded by a loop containing conserved amino acid residues (Fig. 4) . The drastic difference between the two types of proteins is that MIP proteins contain six transmembrane helices whereas in the virus movement proteins the region shown in Figs. 1 and 4 is the only such predicted helix. Nevertheless, we believe that the observed sequence similarity may be functionally relevant indicating that the conserved motif of the \"30 K superfamily\" may mediate membrane interaction. For many proteins of this superfamily, membrane interaction is compatible with the observed localization in the cell wall [40] . However, caution is due in the interpretation of these observations as the hydrophobicity of the conserved region in different movement proteins differed significantly and not for all of them a membrane-spanning helix was confidently predicted ( Fig. 1 b and Fig. 4 . A conserved sequence motif in the movement proteins of dianthoviruses and the MIP family of membrane proteins. Asterisks show identical residues and colons show similar residues in the sequences of the movement protein of RCNMV and TIP1. The consensus (for symbols see legend to Fig. 2) includes the conserved residues, with one possible exception in the MIP-related proteins. The hydrophobic regions predicted to form transmembrane helices are underlined. The motif was extracted from an alignment generated using the MACAW program in some of these proteins the conserved motif may be involved in hydrophobic interactions other than membrane spanning. As mentioned above, membrane localization also has been proposed for the triple block proteins and strongly predicted for the movement proteins of monopartite geminiviruses.",

The region of similarity included the conserved motif of the \"30 K superfamily\", with the invariant aspartic acid residue and the preceding hydrophobic stretch. M 1 protein chaperones newly formed influenza virus RNPs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm; upon formation of virions, this protein is thought to provide the link between the RNP and the virion membrane (reviewed in [35] ). Both of these functions are apparently based on the ability of M 1 to interact both with RNP and the membrane providing a provocative analogy with the plant virus movement proteins.
