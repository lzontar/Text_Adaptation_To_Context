Psychological stress may have an adverse impact on the voice. The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between the change in levels of perceived psychological stress and vocal symptoms among Israeli academic college professors required to shift to synchronous online teaching during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. An online questionnaire was completed by 313 professors (156 men and 157 women) from 14 academic colleges in Israel at the end of the first week of online synchronous teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was assumed to be the most burdened and stressful week of the transition. Participants provided self-reports for the current levels of psychological stress and vocal symptoms during the transition to online synchronous teaching, as well as general psychological stress and general vocal symptoms during previous periods of teaching. Results. The results revealed higher levels of psychological stress but not vocal symptoms during the transition to online synchronous teaching compared with previous periods of teaching. Psychological stress during the transition to online synchronous teaching was positively associated with vocal symptoms during this period but this association was moderated by general stress. Although there was a positive association between psychological stress and vocal symptoms for individuals who reported low levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching, this association was especially strong for individuals who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching. Conclusions. It is important to examine vocal symptoms of professors in specific contexts that are potentially stressful. The psychological stress surrounding the transition to online synchronous teaching was associated with elevated levels of vocal symptoms especially for those who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching. These results with professors accord with the notion that psychological stress may have a negative impact on the voice. Tuomainen J, Sellman J, R\u00f6nnemaa A-M.

The COVID-19 pandemic is both unique and stressful for a variety of reasons including the uncertainty that individuals may have in estimating the danger the pandemic poses for themselves and those close to them (e.g., family members, friends, neighbors, colleagues). However, one of the most notable stressors concerning the COVID-19 pandemic is the tremendous disruption it has caused for daily life. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world (e.g., the number of individuals who have died from the illness or been incapacitated by it; the number of individuals who have been infected by the coronavirus which causes COVID-19; the global economic consequences of the pandemic) as well as the various responses to the pandemic (e.g., social distancing practices, travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders; community curfews and mandatory quarantines) are unprecedented experiences for many individuals. The psychological stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to be exacerbated for those individuals who were already feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the stressors in their lives 11 . This type of increased stress can also be followed by anxiety-related behaviors such as sleep disturbances, and an overall lower perceived state of health. These behaviors may, in turn, affect workload stress related to the need to teach from home and online synchronous teaching arrangements. Anderson and colleagues 12 identified the heavy demands of working in online tutorials in terms of managing the multiple tools for communication and presentation 13 as risk factors for voice use in university professors. Taking into account all other general life arrangements related to the unknown and stressful events, relevant accommodations, isolation, children at home, mixed home and work responsibilities etc., might have a severe impact on emotional stress and mental health, and might sustain elevated muscle tension that, in turn, may negatively affect vocal symptomatology.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1265, "end": 1267, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The aim of the current study is to investigate whether psychological stress is associated with vocal symptoms among university faculty in Israel during the transition to online synchronous teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This result is consistent with the idea that the COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis accompanied by significant levels of psychological stress and tremendous disruptions for daily life 11 . The magnitude of the reported difference in stressfulness is, in all likelihood, not just a reaction to the change in teaching format. Rather, it is an illustration of extensive life changes and how a workplace-related change that is not selfdetermined and that requires significant adaptation during a time of uncertainty can substantially increase the perceived stressfulness of this new teaching mode. No significant differences were found for the perception of vocal symptoms during the transition to online synchronous teaching when compared to the perceptions of the vocal symptoms during previous periods of teaching. It is possible, if not likely, that more time is required for individuals to notice subjective changes related to the experience of specific vocal symptoms. However, support was obtained for our prediction that psychological stress during the transition to online synchronous teaching would correlate positively with vocal symptoms during this period (Hypotheses 2) and that this association would be especially strong for individuals who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching (Hypotheses 3). The results of the present study revealed that the psychological stress surrounding the transition to online synchronous teaching was associated with elevated levels of vocal symptoms, especially for those who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching. These results suggest that current stress is positively associated with current vocal symptoms but that this association is particularly pronounced when the level of general stress is high. This pattern is consistent with previous research showing that psychological stress may affect the voice negatively 2-4 , as well as with the assumption that psychological stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated this connection for those individuals who were already feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the stressors in their lives 11 . The general pattern of results is in keeping with the concept of a \"stress pileup\" and how people already under stress can be impacted disproportionately by new emerging forms of stress layered on top of existing stress.

Thus, although levels of vocal symptoms did not increase, the significant change in perceived stress levels were associated with experiencing more negative vocal symptoms. Moreover, 28.4% of the sample reported they feel they raised their vocal loudness while teaching online synchronically and were found to experience significant higher levels of both current negative symptoms and psychological stress, compared to those reported that they lowered or maintained the same vocal loudness. This result may serve as convergent validity for the effect of stress on voice production (vocal loudness) which associated with both vocal symptoms and psychological stress.

Accordingly, there may be specific stressgenerating traits that are also related to voice symptoms and quality of life such that stress reactivity may lead to voice impairment rather than the experience of transient stress leading to these vocal issues 28, 29 . Therefore, further studies should include both self-reported transient stress, stress-generating predispositions, and their interaction effects in predicting vocal symptoms.
