This paper provides an initial understanding of some driving factors and their consequences. Since transmission requires people, the human factor behind globalization is essential. Globalization, a major force behind global wellbeing and equality, is highly associated with this factor. The analysis investigates the impact globalization has on the speed of initial transmission to a country and on the scale of initial infections in the context of other driving factors. Our cross-country analysis finds that measures of globalization are positively related to the spread of the virus, both in speed and scale. However, the study also finds that globalized countries are better equipped to keep fatality rates low. The conclusion is not to reduce globalization to avoid pandemics, but to better monitor the human factor at the outbreak and mobilize collaboration forces to curtail diseases.",

The lockdown of economies and suspension of free mobility were justified by a rapid transmission of the virus through the human factor of globalization, namely personal interactions. Social distancing at the individual level was complemented by inter-country distancing. The development is marked by a number of disturbing factors: global termination of travel mostly via national policy responses; attacks on global organizations such as the World Health Organization; the conflict between states over pharmaceutical tools and the support of medical research companies; and the de facto absence of leadership from international organizations like the European Union or G20 in the response to this crisis.",

(2020) who studied responses to the coronavirus in China from January to February 2020, stringent quarantine, city lockdown, and local public health measures significantly decreased the transmission rate. Outmigration from the outbreak source region (the city of Wuhan and Hubei province) showed a much stronger transmission factor to their destination regions compared to determinants like geographic proximity and economic conditions. This research suggests social distancing within countries and more importantly distancing between countries early on, focusing on the human factor are crucial to avoid a pandemic or at least to contain it. Hence, strict monitoring of human mobility across borders (including their closure) may seem appropriate. In the face of the current coronavirus threat, would this require reducing globalization in the future?",

While several countries were affected, it was still possible to stop SARS before it became a pandemic (Chan-Yeung and Xu, 2003) . But it was the first international epidemic of the 21st century. During that period, the SARS epidemic also triggered an anti-globalism discourse (So and Pun, 2004) . Even the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that a new disease with wide-ranging impact might appear soon in a world becoming more and more interconnected with cross-boundary interactions becoming easier and more commonplace (WHO, 2003) . However, they also report that globalization might enable rapid information exchange between countries and a quicker response against a pandemic. With the COVID-19 outbreak becoming a pandemic,",

Transmission speed and both of its components D and CP exhibit estimates that all have 1% significance with coefficient sizes for KOF-de jure that are somewhat smaller in absolute terms. This is plausible since the KOF-de facto measure is more closely related to actual human mobility. The findings for the case fatality ratio confirm this insight: globalized economies seem to be more competitive in managing the infection, and the significance and size of the effect here comes primarily through KOFde facto, stressing the importance of human mobility. The KOF-de facto coefficient is significant at 5% and much larger in absolute terms than the KOF-de jure coefficient, which is significant only at 10%.",

However, the effect is statistically significant only for the duration to reach a country (lnD): Warmer countries got the infection earlier. The age variables (age 65+ and median age) do not affect the day gap D at all, but a larger median age increases the infection rate (CP) and the transmission speed (TS), but reduces both with lower significance for the age 65+ variable. This may simply reflect the different exposure the captured age groups have to the virus due to their activities. A higher median age decreases the case fatality ratio (CFR), but a larger portion of age 65+ people increases CFR. These age effects are consistent with prior expectations that COVID-19 is more fatal in elderly people (see also Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020) . Distance increases the day gap until infection but is insignificant afterwards. We also have assumed that distance has no effect on the case fatality ratio. Democracy exhibits practically no significant estimates throughout, and countries with more left governments face a smaller day gap for transition (D). Belt & Road partner countries of China are not negatively affected in any way: The infection rate (CP) is even lower for those countries, at least in the short-run period",

More globalized countries are affected faster and with a larger impact. This has to do with stronger human interactions through travel and migration. The implication is that pandemics can be contained through early measures of temporary inter-country distancing that focuses on human mobility. This is not an argument against globalization however, which makes countries wealthier, more competitive, and more able to invest in health infrastructures and through international collaborations (Dreher, 2006; Potrafke, 2015) . The effect can be clearly seen in the lower fatality rates provided in this study. However, the coronavirus crisis should stimulate debates about developing flexible systems to execute appropriate inter-country distancing measures and determining early indicators to trace future pandemic potentials. Trade policies can be designed to strengthen the effective exchange of disease-relevant goods and services instead of hindering it.",

The only available short-term options outside the healthcare sector are strategies of social and inter-country distancing including lockdowns and border closures. The year 1918 marked the end of World War I, with many (mostly unfriendly) cross-country human interactions. The world had been fairly globalized before World War I. In fact Flandreau et al. (2010, see pp. 100-101, in particular Figure 4.3) argue that characterizing globalization as trade openness, financial integration and international migration, the world was even more open than today for financial integration and (most important in our context) international migration. Social and inter-country distancing are concepts that are obviously in conflict with globalization.

The alternative measures may provide insights into the nature of the disease's relationship with globalization and are useful for robustness checks. For instance, the \"de facto\" measure of globalization contains more information related to actual human mobility and should potentially have a larger effect on the transmission of the disease. The baseline equation is: vector of controls and is the error term in the country i. Coronavirus Variables are D, CP, TS or CFR, Economic Globalization is KOF-over, KOF-de facto or KOF-de jure. Control variables are average temperature in March, the median age of the population, population age 65 and above as a percentage of the total population, distance in km between Beijing and the respective country's capital, a democracy index (Institutionalized Democracy Index), a \"Belt Country\" dummy variable for the member countries of China's One Belt One Road project, and an index for government ideology with values 1 for right, 2 for moderate and 3 for left. We use the following variables in ln form to model the non-linear relationship in the data and simplify interpretation: Coronavirus Variables, Economic Globalization variables, median age of the population, population with age 65 and above as a percentage of the total population, and distance from Beijing. The available dataset includes the 118 countries listed in the Appendix. Definitions and sources of all variables and their descriptive statistics are provided in",

Although many Chinese workers are present in African One Belt One Road countries, they are known to live there fairly isolated. Most countries affiliate closely to the drawn line, showing a somewhat slower, but falling transition duration. A number of countries assemble in the lower right of the figure indicating that they are all fairly globalized with some located closely geographically (Nepal, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Thailand, Malysia, Philippines, Russia) and others are particularly global and developed (Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, the United States, South Korea, Australia, Canada and Spain).

Black Death is thought to have originated in Central or East Asia and spread to Europe via trade along the Silk Road, while Spanish Flu can be traced back to a US military personnel from Fort Riley, Kansas traveling with the US troops to Europe during World War I. Mankel et al. (2007) report 40 million deaths worldwide due to the Flu Pandemic, but estimates typically vary in the literature between 17-50 million. Black Death is reported to have resulted in 25 -50 million casualties in Europe and about 75-200 million in Eurasia and North Africa. With over 170,000 deaths worldwide associated with the coronavirus so far, the current burden still seems comparatively small 1 , yet the health care systems of some countries are already under substantial pressure. But given the likelihood of several mortality waves (the Flu Pandemic had three, with the second being",
