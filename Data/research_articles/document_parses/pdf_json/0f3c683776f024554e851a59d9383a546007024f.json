In the case of the S2 domain of protein S, it has been found a highly hydrophobic and interfacial domain flanked by the heptad repeat 1 and 2 regions; significantly, different peptides pertaining to this domain have shown a significant leakage effect and an important plaque formation inhibition, which, similarly to HIV-1 gp41, support the role of this region in the fusion process. Therefore, we have carried out a study of the binding and interaction with model membranes of a peptide corresponding to segment 1073\u00c11095 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, peptide SARS L in the presence of different membrane model systems, as well as the structural changes taking place in both the lipid and the peptide induced by the binding of the peptide to the membrane. Our results show that SARS L strongly partitions into phospholipid membranes and organizes differently in lipid environments, displaying membrane activity modulated by the lipid composition of the membrane. These data would support its role in SARS-CoV mediated membrane fusion and suggest that the region where this peptide resides could be involved in the merging of the viral and target cell membranes.",

Similar to other coronavirus, SARS-CoV membrane fusion is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein located on the viral envelope. Trimers of the spike protein form the peplomers that protrude from the virion giving these viruses their distinctive crown-like appearance. SARS-CoV S glycoprotein seems to be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits in Vero-E6 infected cells [5] , but cleavage is not an absolute requirement for the mechanism of fusion [6] . Additionally, infection mediated by the SARS-CoV protein can be inhibited by specific inhibitors of the endosomal protease cathepsin L [7] suggesting that protein cleavage might play an important role activating spike protein for membrane fusion.",

Interestingly, raft microdomains have been also shown to be involved in virus entry [9] .

In the case of the HIV gp41 envelope protein, as well as in other fusion proteins of other retroviruses, it has been shown that the presence of a conserved immunodominant domain in the region of the loop separating the two heptad repeats that reverse the polypeptide chain [21\u00c124] . This region seems important in the stabilization of the trimeric helical hairpin either in aqueous solution or in the presence of membranes [25] . Moreover, it has been shown that mutations in the loop region of gp41 affect the formation and dilation of fusion pores that are permeable to relatively small soluble molecules suggesting a role of this region in late steps of the membrane fusion process [26] . Finally, different peptides corresponding to this region have shown membrane binding and membrane perturbing capabilities [27\u00c129] , and therefore the interaction of this domain with the target cell membrane may be of key importance in the viral fusion mechanism. In the case of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, it was found a highly hydrophobic and interfacial domain flanked by the HR1 and HR2 regions [16] (Figure 1 ), and different peptides pertaining to this domain have shown a significant leakage effect [16] and an important Figure 1 . Hydrophobic moment, hydrophobicity, interfaciality distribution, and relative position of the SARS L peptide used in this study along the SARS-CoV spike S2 domain, assuming it forms an a-helical wheel [16] . Only positive bilayer-to-water transfer free-energy values are depicted (the darker, the higher). The scheme of the structure of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein S2 (amino acid residues 758\u00c1761 to 1255 for the full-length) according to literature consensus is also shown. The relevant functional regions are highlighted: the putative fusion peptide (FP), the internal fusion peptide (IFP), the predicted heptad repeat regions pertaining HR1, HR2, and the pre-transmembrane (PTM), transmembrane (TM) domains [14, 16, 19, 20, 34] . The sequence of the peptide used in this work is also shown. SARS-CoV plaque formation inhibition [30] . These results support a role of this region in the fusion process such as it has been shown for the loop domain of HIV-1 gp41. Apart from that, while much progress has been made in understanding the membrane fusion mechanism of different viruses, available data concerning coronaviruses, particularly in the case of SARS-CoV, are scarce. Therefore, the purpose of the present work was to gain an insight into the implication of the SARS-CoV loop domain in the membrane interaction.",

The structural and dynamical changes which take place in both the SARS L peptide and the phospholipid molecules induced by its interaction with the lipid bilayer have been characterized using monolayer penetration and fluorescence and infrared spectroscopy. Our results show that SARS L strongly partitions into phospholipid membranes and organizes differently in lipid environments, displaying membrane-activity modulated by the lipid composition of the membrane. These data suggest that the regions where the peptide SARS L resides could be involved in the merging of the viral and target cell membranes.",

Slightly higher K p values were obtained for negatively charged phospholipid-containing bilayers, EPG, EPA and BPS, than liposomes containing the neutral phospholipid EPC. These results were further corroborated by the displacement in the maximum emission wavelength of Trp in the presence of phospholipids LUVs. In buffer, the peptide had an emission maximum at 345 nm, typical for Trp in a polar environment, whereas, in the presence of increasing concentrations of membranes, the emission maximum presented a shift of about 4\u00c16 nm to shorter wavelengths in negatively charged liposomes, but only 1 nm for zwitterionic ones. Differences in the fluorescence anisotropy values of the SARS L peptide were also observed when in the presence of phospholipid model membranes. It was found that addition of LUVs to the peptide increased significantly the anisotropy values (Table I) , indicating an eventual decrease in the mobility of the Trp residue. The increase in anisotropy was lower in the zwitterionic phospholipid EPC than in the presence of the negatively charged phospholipids BPS, EPG and EPA. The SARS L peptide has a positive net formal charge of '1, so that an electrostatic effect might be the reason to observe relatively high binding and anisotropy values for compositions containing negatively charged phospholipids. However, it is not only the electrostatic attraction that is playing a role, since, as shown below, the peptide affects more significantly membranes containing zwitterionic phospholipids rather than those containing negatively-charged ones. The peptide mobility will be addressed in more detail later in the article, in the framework of the time-resolved data.",

Stern-Volmer plots for the quenching of Trp by acrylamide, recorded in the absence and presence of lipid vesicles, are shown in Figure 2B and the resultant Stern-Volmer constants are presented in Table I . The data reveal a weaker decrease in the fluorescence intensity in the presence of liposomes, indicating that the Trp residue was less accessible to the quencher in the presence of LUVs. The K SV value for the zwitterionic phospholipid EPC was slightly higher than those found in the presence of negatively charged phospholipids. As observed in Figure 2B , the plots are linear with a unitary intercept showing that the Stern-Volmer dynamic quenching formalism describes accurately the data (it will be shown later that the variations in the peptide fluorescence lifetime do not affect this result). The transverse location (penetration) of the SARS L peptide in the lipid bilayer was evaluated by monitoring the relative quenching of the fluorescence of the Trp residue by the lipophylic spin probes 5NS and 16NS when the peptide was incorporated in the fluid phase of vesicles having different phospholipid compositions ( Figure 2C ). It can be seen that, in general, and for each one of the different membrane compositions studied, the SARS L peptide was quenched more efficiently by 16NS, quencher for molecules near or at the interface, than by 5NS, quencher for molecules buried deeply in the membrane allowing to conclude that SARS L remained close to the lipid/water interface. It can be seen that in general, and for each one of the different membrane compositions studied, although the SARS L peptide was quenched slightly more efficiently by 16NS, the difference for the two probes is not very high. This allows the conclusion that Trp resides in between these probes.",

            "text": "All the parameters describing the peptide fluorescence intensity decay are given in Table II . As expected for Trp [34] , the decays are described by the sum of three exponentials, with typical values for the components lifetimes. The mean fluorescence lifetime at 258C is around 2 ns, also a typical behavior for Trp residues. However, the lifetimeweighted quantum yield had an unusual behavior. In the absence of static quenching, this parameter should be proportional to the steady-state fluorescence intensity (to the quantum yield), and it is expected to decrease monotonically with raising temperature. As shown in Table II , this is not the case, because the amplitude averaged lifetime increases from 25\u00c1508C. This means that in addition to thermal deactivation of the excited state, there should be another factor contributing to the lower quantum yield at 258C. For the peptide in solution, this suggests that the peptide conformation and/or aggregation state changes between 25 and 508C. Either the peptide becomes denatured, or an aggregate is destroyed at the higher temperature, taking a Trp quencher side-chain away from the vicinity of the indole ring. Upon interacting with lipid bilayers of different compositions, the parameters describing the fluorescence intensity decays of the peptide tend to change, but not dramatically [27, 28, 35] . The general trend observed here is a slight increase of both the amplitude-weighted and the intensityweighted average lifetimes, except for EPC, for which the interaction with the peptide is weaker and the changes on peptide/structure/dynamics are smaller. The slight increase observed for the amplitude-weighted lifetime in all the anionic membranes studied is at variance with the marked decrease observed for the steady-state fluorescence intensity. This effect should be due to a strong conformational change and/or extensive aggregation of the peptide in the membrane. The fact that the amplitudes and the lifetime components change only mildly, and also that the order of the relative amplitudes was kept, suggests that a strong conformational change is not taking place, and favors an interpretation of the data as an extensive aggregation upon interaction with the membrane.",

            "text": "In order to gain more insight into the dynamic behavior of SARS L , as well as information on its aggregation state in water, the fluorescence anisotropy decay of the peptide was obtained in different systems. From visual inspection of the experimental fluorescence anisotropy decays (not shown), it could be observed that the fluorescence anisotropy at very long times tended to zero in buffer solution, and to a small value in zwitterionic membrane (EPC). In addition, the dynamic component was slower for the peptide interacting with membranes than in water solution, and in the case of anionic membranes, even at very long times, the fluorescence anisotropy had a significant positive value. The decay of the anisotropy starts in general at a value lower than the fundamental anisotropy of Trp at the excitation wavelength used, which is r 0 \u00c20.2 [44] . This is probably due to a very fast wobbling motion of the indole moiety of the Trp residue that is unresolved, especially in the case of the lipid containing samples, due to stronger scattering. For the peptide in buffer, the results of the analyses of the anisotropy decays are shown in Table III . A very fast component (B100 ps) had to be included in the analysis in order to obtain a low chi-square and random distribution of residuals, but because it could not be accurately determined, it is not presented in the Table. The rotation corresponding to the longer rotational correlation time was responsible for the remaining depolarization. In order to determine if this was due to some kind of segmental motion or due to the rotation of the whole peptide, the volume of the peptide was calculated from its molecular mass [45] .",

            "text": "In this way, a volume of 3402 \u00c5 3 /molecule was obtained. In Table III the predicted rotational correlation time for a sphere of this volume rotating in water is also shown. It is clear that both at 158C and 258C, the experimental value of the rotational correlation time corresponds to a peptide dimer. At these two temperatures the peptide has probably the same molecular organization. This result correlates well with the tendency of the peptide to form aggregates in which a quenching of the Trp residue fluorescence takes place, and that those aggregates are partially or totally destroyed when reaching 508C. The fluorescence anisotropy decay in membranes is clearly different from those in water. The parameters retrieved from the analysis of those decays are given in Table IV . It is clear from the data displayed in Table IV that the rotational dynamics of the peptide is different in the several systems. However, the most significant differences Table II . Fluorescence lifetime components t i , normalized amplitudes a i , and fluorescence mean lifetime (amplitude weighted,t; and intensity weighted, Bt!) of the Trp residue of the SARS L peptide in buffer, in the presence of phospholipid model membranes at 258C. The reduced x 2 values of the fits to the experimental fluorescence decays are also given. The peptide/lipid ratio was 1:30. (considering the error associated to the parameters majored by 15%, not shown) are a smaller value of r for EPC, and a longer rotational correlation time for EPA (in the case of EPG, there is a broad surface minimum for which r could be slightly higher and f slightly shorter, which would be effectively closer to the f of BPS/EPC and r closer to BPS; in the EPG system the average lifetime is longer than in BPS and this could also allow a better definition of the dynamic part, and the retrieval of a smaller r ). Focusing on the two major differences mentioned, the anisotropy decay in EPC can be interpreted in a similar way to the one observed in water, but in a medium of higher viscosity (slower rotational correlation time), and also with some hindering (non-zero anisotropy for long times), but the peptide seems to be loosely associated to the membrane. For the other lipids, this is not the case. The rotational dynamics of the Trp residue is severely hindered. Taking the fact that no strong structural alterations in the vicinity of the Trp residue are concluded from the fluorescence intensity decay parameters (Table II) , together with the anisotropy decay data, this point to the formation of large aggregates that have only limited motion in the time scale of the fluorescence emission. In the case of EPA, the rotational correlation time is significantly longer. This may be due to the establishment of strong interactions at the level of the small and the less hydrated EPA headgroup that slow down the Trp residue rotational motions as it anchors the peptide at the membrane/water interface. This is fully consistent with the larger spectral shift (low hydration) observed for the peptide in the presence of EPA, but also larger water accessibility (less protection by the small phospholipid headgroup). The K SV value is actually the product of the bimolecular quenching rate constant times the average fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore in the absence of quenching. In this way, it is important to check if there are significant variations in that parameter in order to compare quencher accessibility from K SV values. By dividing K SV (Table I) by Bt! (Table II) , it is verified that the water accessibility decreases in the order EPC !EPA ! BPS \u00c2EPG.",

Fitting parameters for the anisotropy decay of the peptide SARS L (rotational correlation time f, associated depolarization b, and limiting anisotropy r ) in lipid membranes of several compositions at 258C.

This corresponds to the gel phase of the saturated phospholipid, for which the order and rigidity is kept deeper along the acyl chains. In the presence of the SARS L peptide, the decay becomes in general more complex. An intermediate component either appears or becomes more important to the total decay, with a consequent decrease of the intensity and amplitude averaged fluorescence lifetimes of DPH. This shows that in all cases, the peptide perturbs the membrane in such a way that it is sensed in the hydrophobic core. The effect of the peptide in the average lifetimes is similar (though lesser) to the effect of the fusion peptide of the SARS-CoV in the same or similar lipids [34] . However, the effect on the lifetime components is different. In the presence of the SARS-CoV fusion peptide the decay was more complex, originating a short (sub-nanosecond) component with an amplitude of more than \u00c230%, and, e.g., the amplitude averaged lifetime becomes in every case B3 ns. In the case of the SARS L peptide, the stronger effect is felt on the intermediate component, and although this is related to an increase in the polarity of the environment of the DPH fluorophore, there is no direct contact with water (that would lead to a component B0.5 ns), and in fact the SARS L peptide does not perturb the bilayer structure in a way as drastic as the fusion peptide does, as expected from the proposed function of the fusion and the loop peptides. Another interesting feature is that in the case of the fusion peptide, the relative effect on the average lifetimes was stronger in the anionic lipid both below and above T m . In the case of the SARS L peptide, it is clear that below T m , the effect is much more pronounced in DMPG, whereas above T m , it is in POPE membranes that the effect is more marked.",

For the peptide in solution, the Amide I' band was quite symmetric with a maximum at about 1646 cm (1 , implying that the peptide consisted mainly of a mixture of helical and unordered structures [47] ( Figure 4A ). However, a significant change in the Amide I' envelope was observed in the presence of model membranes of EPC ( Figure 4B ) and EPG ( Figure 4C ). In the presence of EPC, the Amide I' band consisted of a main band at about 1625 cm (1 and a shoulder at about 1642 cm (1 , whereas in the presence of EPG two bands of similar intensity appearing at about 1641 and 1618 cm (1 were observed. Since bands at about 1625 cm (1 can be assigned to b-sheet structures, whereas bands at about 1618 cm (1 correspond to aggregated ones, these data would imply that the SARS L peptide structure changed from a mixture of helical and unordered structures to a mixture of helical, unordered and b-sheet structures in the presence of EPC and a mixture of helical, unordered and aggregated structures in the presence of EPG. These results imply that the secondary structure of the SARS L peptide was affected by the phospholipid composition of the membrane.",

            "text": "Enveloped viruses use membrane fusion proteins in order to juxtapose and merge the viral and cellular membranes. The viral fusion protein of SARS-CoV is the envelope Spike glycoprotein and the S2 domain is the responsible for fusion. Recent studies point to the fact that there are several regions within Class I and Class II membrane fusion proteins which are involved in the interaction with the membrane to accomplish fusion [48\u00c151] . Although in other Class I fusion proteins plentiful data have been obtained to understand the implication of these membraneinteracting segments in the fusion mechanism, available information concerning the possible membrane-active regions in coronavirus, and particularly in the case of SARS-CoV, is scarce. Many studies performed to examine the interaction of synthetic peptides mimicking functional regions have been shown to be very valuable in the understanding of membrane viral fusion. Several peptides have been identified in the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein as belonging to membrane interacting regions [14, 16, 19, 20, 34] . In this work we have focused on the possible roles of the loop region in the membrane fusion process. We have selected a specific segment from the SARS CoV sequence which corresponds to the loop region, SARS L , to carry out an in-depth biophysical study aimed at elucidating the capacity of this region to interact and disrupt membranes, as well as to study the structural and dynamic features which might be relevant for that disruption. From the methodological point of view, it is noteworthy that the screening of the protein sequence taking into account hydrophobic moment, hydrophobicity and interfaciality allowed a precise identification of the membrane-active sequences, and in addition provided insight into their functions. In general, the experimental biophysical studies conducted corroborate the putative functions of those sequences, at the same time revealing new and less expected features that contributed to the Table V . Fluorescence lifetime components t i , normalized amplitudes a i , and fluorescence mean lifetimes (amplitude weighted,t; and intensity weighted, Bt !) of DPH in phospholipid model membranes in the absence, in the presence of the SARS L peptide below, above the phospholipid T m . * From ref. [34] . better understanding of the molecular mechanism of infection by SARS-CoV (Figure 1 ). The SARS L peptide binds with high affinity to model membranes, although it showed a higher affinity for anionic-phospholipid compositions than those containing zwitterionic phospholipids. These results were further corroborated by the study of the change in the maximum emission wavelength of the Trp residue, as well as the increase in anisotropy in the presence of model membranes. The greater affinity for anionic phospholipids rather than for zwitterionic ones was already expected, due to the positive net charge of the peptide. The interaction with membrane vesicles decreased the Trp quenching by acrylamide as illustrated by the low K SV values obtained, indicating a low accessibility of the quencher to the peptide. The lipophylic probe quenching results suggest a shallow-to-intermediate location of the peptide in the membrane, but the extent of quenching is relatively low compared to other peptides [19, 52, 53] . This fact and the decrease in fluorescence suggest a possible aggregation of the peptide when bound to the membrane. The fluorescence intensity decay of the peptide supports the experiments and conclusions commented above.",

Therefore, the loop region might mediate the interactions between different gp41 trimers facilitating the completion of later steps of the membrane fusion process. The formation of a dimer in solution and larger aggregates in the presence of membranes suggests a similar role of the loop region of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV.

The SARS L would thus have a more primordial role because importantly it interacts strongly and specifically with zwitterionic lipids whereas the SARS FP interacts only weakly and non-specifically (e.g., the K p of SARS L to EPC is \u00c210 6 ( Table I) and for SARS FP the interaction was too weak to allow determination of a K p value [34] . In this way the transverse asymmetry of the target cell membrane, which is challenged by the perturbation induced by the SARS L peptide in the outer leaflet, becomes of major importance for the process. In addition, the perturbation of the membrane is somewhat controlled because the membrane core becomes less hydrophobic (Table V) but not as much as with the SARS FP . This may be important to prevent fusion to occur randomly. SARS L would have a more facilitator and controller role, whereas SARS FP would have a more effector role in the fusion process.",
