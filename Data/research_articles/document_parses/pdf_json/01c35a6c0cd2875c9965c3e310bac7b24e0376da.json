Some cultural associations in Italy have denounced the problems that patients suffering from hearing impairments have understanding and communicating with the health personnel constantly wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), especially when they have to go to the emergency room for any need. Face masks represent an ally in the fight against COVID-19, but a challenge for patients with hearing loss for two main reasons; they reduce acoustic transmission and prevent lip reading 8 . Additionally, PPE makes more uncomfortable for the patients wearing hearing devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants.",

Furthermore, in regard to the use of face masks by health personnel, they were asked if they were more bothered by the reduced acoustic transmission or the impossibility of lip reading. Our results showed that 8 (13.6%) subjects did not have difficulties, 15 (25.4%) presented mild difficulties, 22 (37.3%) moderate and 14 (23.7%) severe. Interestingly, the main concern about face masks was the sound attenuation for 26 (44.1%) subjects and the impossibility of lip reading for 33 (55.9%).",
