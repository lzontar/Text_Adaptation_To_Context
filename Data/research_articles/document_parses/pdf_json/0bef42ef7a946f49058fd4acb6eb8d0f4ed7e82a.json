In the classical SEIR model, a population of size N i in the ith region is divided into susceptible (S i ), exposed (E i ), infected (I i ) and recovered (R i ) components. We extended the model by including an extra compartment as hospitalized (H i ). This included all those entering hospitals and quarantine centers.

If the susceptible person is exposed to the virus, the individual is moved to the exposed compartment at the rate of \u03b2 i .

As a consequence, the number of self-quarantined individuals increased from 26 th March onwards. Hence, we added a new compartment named quarantined (Q i ) for each district i in the existing model. The compartment Q i consists of exposed individuals identified by contact tracing and susceptible individuals living in the sealed-off villages.
