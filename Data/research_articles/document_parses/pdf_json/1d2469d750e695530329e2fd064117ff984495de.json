Intensive care unit (ICU) capacity for COVID-19 patients has been expanded by converting post-anaesthesia care units (PACUs) into ICU, medical tents, deployment of care providers from OR to ICU, and numerous other innovations across geographies. Further capacity has been enabled by rescheduling non-urgent elective surgeries or, more generally, from learnings from prior reports following an influenza epidemic [1] .",

From the figure, for example, we can see that with 60 COVID-19 ICU beds, approximately 5.5 COVID-19 patients/day can make it through if 6.0 such patients/day arrive.

The Fig. 1 Average throughput rate in long term of COVID patients per day as a function of the arrival rate and bed capacity. Throughput is the number of patients per day that can go through the system. Patient throughput rates would equal the patient arrival rates (the diagonal dotted line) if all patients were to be admitted to the ICU but is less than the arrival rate due to bed blocking.
