Cotreatment within OT/PT reinforces patients' successful tolerance and regulation of negative affect to accomplish rehabilitation goals. Our integrative medicine department has developed mindfulness recordings translated into multiple languages that we use with non-English speaking patients. We also use virtual reality headsets to visually and auditorily immerse patients in naturalistic environments and to facilitate mindfulness meditation. Such exercises are highly engaging and especially helpful given patients' prolonged isolation from the outside world. In brief psychotherapy sessions, we use cognitive restructuring and problem-solving, and we help patients to self-validate their emotional experiences. Patients feel comforted to learn that negative emotions are not inherently \"bad\" and develop a toolbox of skills to regulate emotions when necessary.",

Interacting with others fighting COVID-19 validates patients' shared experiences and fosters resiliency.

To facilitate orientation and memory, all patient rooms have a large whiteboard on which providers write their names and where patients' rehabilitation goals and progress are recorded. We wear large laminated ID tags with names and pictures over our personal protective equipment, which facilitates orientation, memory, and engagement with the team.

Nonetheless, our approach may inform care within similar specialized COVID-19 recovery units.
