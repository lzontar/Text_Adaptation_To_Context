Naturally, simulation systems that follow precise mathematical and statistical models are playing an important role in understanding this dynamic and complex situation [2] .

They typically use a uniform static grid to represent the spread of infections, from a location to its neighbors, over time.

Agent-Level Modeling: While population-level dynamical evolutions of population variables are simple and very effective for overall assessment, they do not take into account any social dynamics, human behavior, government-mandated restrictions, and complexities of human interactions explicitly. The models that study these human-level factors and variables , while tracking disease at an individual level, are called agent-level models [7] . Here one models the mobility, health status, and interactions of individual subjects (agents) in order to construct an overall population-level picture in a bottom-up way. The advantages of agent-based models are that they are more detailed and one can vary the parameters of restriction measures, such as social distancing, at a granular level to infer overall outcomes. Agent-based models have been discussed in several papers, including [3, [8] [9] [10] and so on. The importance of simulations based analysis of epidemic spread is emphasized in [11] but with a focus on infection models within host. Some aspect of spreading of diseases using network contact is also discussed. Hunter et al. [10] construct a detailed agent-based model for spread of infectious diseases, taking into account population demographics and other social conditions, but they do not consider countermeasures such as lockdowns in their simulations. A broad organization of different agent-based simulation methods have been presented in [3] . There are numerous other papers on the topic of agent-based simulations for simulating spread of infections that are not referenced.",

In this paper we assume a closed community with the infection started by a single agent at initial time. The infections are transmitted through physical exposure of susceptible agents to the infected agents. The infected agents go through a period of sickness with two eventual outcomes -full recovery for most and death for a small fraction. Once recovered, the agents can no longer be infected. The social dynamical model used here is based on fixed domicile, i.e. each agent has a fixed housing unit. Under unrestricted conditions, or no lockdown, the agents are free to move over the full domain using a simple motion model. These motions are independent across agents and encourage smooth paths. Under lockdown conditions, most of the agents head directly to their housing units and generally stay there during that period. A very small fraction of agents are allowed to move freely under the restrictions.",

In terms of the model design, there are competing requirements for such a simulation to be useful. Our main considerations in the design of ALPS are as follows. On one hand, we want to capture detailed properties of agents and their pertinent environments so as to render a realistic model of pandemic evolution with or without countermeasures. On the other hand, we want to keep model complexity reasonably low, in order to utilize it for analysis under variable conditions and countermeasures. Also, to obtain statistical summaries of pandemic conditions under different scenarios, we want to run a large number of simulations and compute averages. This also requires keeping the overall model tractable from a computational perspective to allow for multiple runs of ALPS in short time.",

Before it can be used in practice, there is an important need to validate it in some way. As described in [3] , there are several ways to validate a simulation model. One is to use real data (an observed census of infections over time) in a community to estimate model parameters, followed by a statistical model testing. While such data may emerge for Covid-19 for public use in the future (especially with the advent of tracking apps being deployed in many countries), there is currently no such agent-level data available for Covid-19. The other approach for validation is to consider coarse population-level variables and their dynamics, and compare them against established models such as SIR and its variations. We take this latter approach. Fig. 2 shows plots of the evolutions of global infection counts (susceptible, infection, recovered) in a community under the well-known SIR model (on the left) and the proposed ALPS model (on the right). In the ALPS model the counts for recovered and fatalities are kept separate, while in SIR model these two categories are combined. One can see a remarkable similarity in the shapes of corresponding curves and this provides a certain validation to the ALPS model. In fact, given the dynamical models of agent-level mobility and infections, one can in principle derive parameters of the population-level differential equations used in the SIR model. We have left that out for future developments.",

In case the restrictions are imposed on day 5, and all other parameters held same, there is a small change in the situation. The peak infection rises to 55%, the fatalities increase to 7% and the fraction of uninfected goes down to 40%. We can see that an early imposition of lockdown measures also helps reduce peak infection rates in the community. Sometimes we notice a saw-tooth shape in the curve for infected people. This implies that the even the small portion of mobile agents can break through and spread infections at other home units despite full restrictions being in place. This saw-tooth shape underscores the need for severely limiting mobility. Even a small fraction of population being mobile can spread infections to the immobile agents and cause infections.",

This shows that, under the chosen parameter settings, day 20 is quite late in imposing lockdown conditions on the community, and the results are very similar to any later imposition.

This variance is kept large to allow for near arbitrary placements of agents in the community. In practice, however, agents typically follow semi-rigid daily schedules of being at work, performing chores, or being at home. Thus, at the time of imposition of a lockdown, the agents can be better placed in the scenes according to their regular schedules rather than being placed arbitrarily.",

(2) One can include typical daily schedules for agents in the simulations. A typical agent may leave home in the morning, spent time in the office during the day, and return to home in the evening. (3) It is possible to provide an age demographics to the community and assign immunity to agents according to their demographic labels [13] . (4) As more data becomes available in the future, one can change immunity levels of agents over time according to the spread and seasons. (5) In practice, when an agent is infected, he/she goes through different stages of the disease, associated with varying degrees of mobility [9] . One can introduce an additional variable to track these stages of infections in the model and change agent mobility accordingly.",
