It indicates that the Au metal catalyzes the dissociation of O 2 gas and facilitates the oxygen ion formation on the surface of the Au@BNNT. Based on the frontier molecular orbital analysis, the LUMO level (Fig. 2) is mainly restricted on the surface of Au atom in the Au@BNNT (I) which makes it a promising site for O 2 adsorption. It should be noted that the O-O bond length of the free O 2 \u2212 molecule is calculated to be 1.36 \u00c5. In the free O 2 \u2212 molecule an electron is inserted to the \u03c0 2p * orbital and the spin multiplicity is doublet.

Additionally, the Fermi level of Au@BNNT moves from -4.092 to -4.182 eV. This shows that the electron emission will decrease from the surface ofAu@BNNT by the O 2 adsorption. Next, we explored the adsorption of breath exhaled NO gas on the pre-adsorbed O 2 molecule as shown in Fig. 4. The (NO) 2 /O 2 /Au@BNNT complex displays that upon the adsorption of two NO molecules, they react with the pre-chemisorbed O ions and yield two NO 2 molecules. This reaction releases some of the trapped electrons by O anions back into the Au@BNNT. The remaining charge on each NO 2 molecules is about 0.15 |e|. The NO 2 molecules then weakly adsorb on the surface of the Au@BNNT (Fig. 4) with E ad of -11.3 kcal/mol per molecule. The NO adsorption on the O 2 /Au@BNNT complex has to pass through a transition state structure as exposed in Fig. 4. In the transition state structure, the O-O bonds is weakening by stretching from 1.33 and to 1.55 \u00c5 and two new N-O bonds are forming with length about 1.40 \u00c5.

After the NO adsorption and generation of NO 2 molecules under catalytic effect of Au atom, the E g of Au@BNNT somewhat back toward its initial value (by about 0.119 eV, Table 2) due to an electron back-donation process from the O ions to the Au@BNNT.The E g may be an electronic parameter to quantity an adsorbent sensitivity toward a gas regarding the relationship between the electrical conductance and E g based on the Eq. 6.

Thus, the sensing response of O 2 /Au@BNNT is about 2.1 which is negligible compared to its response toward NO gas (~ 101.5). Consequently, we deduced that the Au@BNNT could sense the exhaled NO gas in the presence of H 2 O, and CO 2 gases. Very recently, new respiratory viral infection COVID-19 caused a great mortality. Thus, finding fast and portable sensors for screening people who may have risen risk of pathogen contact is of great importance. One proposed potential approach to recognize the viral infection is analysis of exhaled gases. It has been indicated that the nitric oxide is one of most important biomarkers which might be emanated by respiratory epithelial cells. Here, DFT calculations were applied to investigate the probable application of Au@BNNT as a breathalyzer to detect exhaled NO gas as a symptom of COVID-19 infection. It was found that by the Au-decoration on the surface of BNNT, the O 2 molecules of air adsorb on the Au atom, weakening the O-O bond which makes it favorable site for NO attack and NO 2 formation. This process required a small energy barrier of 5.2 kcal/mol which makes it possible at room temperature. We predicted a short recovery time and high sensing response of 1.8 \u00b5s and 101.5 at 298 K for Au@BNNT as an NO sensor.
