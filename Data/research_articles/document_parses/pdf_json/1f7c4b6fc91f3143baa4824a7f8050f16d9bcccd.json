            "text": "Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) viruses are a major cause of disease and economic loss in pigs worldwide. High genetic diversity among PRRSV strains is problematic for successful disease control by vaccination. Mosaic DNA and vaccinia (VACV) vaccines were developed in order to improve protection against heterologous PRRSV strains. Methods: Piglets were primed and boosted with GP5-Mosaic DNA vaccine and recombinant GP5-Mosaic VACV (rGP5-Mosaic VACV), respectively. Pigs vaccinated with rGP5-WT (VR2332) DNA and rGP5-WT VACV, or empty vector DNA and empty VACV respectively, served as controls. Virus challenge was given to separate groups of vaccinated pigs with VR2332 or MN184C. Necropsies were performed 14 days after challenge. Results: Vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic-based vaccines resulted in cellular reactivity and higher levels of neutralizing antibodies to both VR2332 and MN184C PRRSV strains. In contrast, vaccination of animals with the GP5-WT vaccines induced responses only to VR2332. Furthermore, vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic based vaccines resulted in protection against challenge with two heterologous virus strains, as demonstrated by the significantly lower viral loads in serum, tissues, porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, and less severe lung lesions after challenge with either MN184C or VR2332, which have only 85% identity. In contrast, significant protection by the GP5-WT based vaccines was only achieved against the VR2332 strain. Conclusions: GP5-Mosaic vaccines, using a DNA-prime/VACV boost regimen, conferred protection in pigs against heterologous viruses.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a major disease in pigs that causes significant economic losses to industry across the world. In the United States alone, PRRS causes over $600 million in losses a year [1] . PRRS causes reproductive failure in pregnant sows and respiratory disease in young pigs. The causal virus, PRRSV, is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a lipid envelope, and belongs to the Family Arteriviridae, Order Nidovirales [2] [3] [4] . The genome is approximately 15 Kb long and encodes at least 22 different viral proteins including fourteen non-structural and eight structural proteins [5] . PRRSV induces both humoral and cellular immune responses in pigs and some of the viral proteins inducing such responses have been identified; however, protection against reinfection is incomplete [6] [7] [8] [9] . Killed virus (KV) vaccines and modified live virus (MLV) vaccines for PRRS have been licensed for more than two decades. These vaccines generally reduce the severity of clinical signs and the transmission of virus; however, they do not induce sterilizing immunity. In general, the efficacy of MLV vaccines is superior to that of KV vaccines [10] [11] [12] [13] . Importantly, however, highly variable and generally sub-optimal levels of protection against heterologous PRRSV strains have been reported [10, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The potential for reversion to the virulence of MLV vaccines and subsequent transmission to susceptible pigs is a concern [19] [20] [21] .",

Currently, two major PRRSV genotypes are recognized, Genotype 1 (European) and Genotype 2 (North American), which exhibit nearly 40% sequence dissimilarity [22, 23] . Genotype 1 and Genotype 2 PRRSVs can be further divided into four subgroups and nine different lineages, respectively, based on phylogenetic analysis of ORF5 [24] . The co-existence of multiple variants within one farm, or even within individual pigs, possibly indicates the occurrence of quasispecies variation of PRRSV [25] . Thus, the development of vaccines that can induce protection against different subgroups and lineages is highly desirable. Multi-subunit vaccines [26] , consensus vaccines [27] , molecular breeding of different viral structural proteins [28] , Mosaic T-cell vaccines [29, 30] , a polyvalent vaccine containing five different live-attenuated PRRSV strains [31] and DNA prime-MLV boost [32] are just some of the vaccines that are or have been under evaluation recently.",

We previously reported that a PRRSV Mosaic vaccine based on 748 GP5 sequences of the Genotype 2 PRRSV strain was immunogenic [29] and induced reactivity to four divergent Genotype-2 PRRSV strains that had at least 10% or more difference in their GP5 sequence-as shown by the expression of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells-and, further, that vaccinated pigs were protected against challenge with VR2332 [30] . The present study demonstrates further that vaccination of pigs with the GP5-Mosaic by using a DNA prime and rVaccinia boost approach protects them against strains that are more than 10% divergent in their sequences (VR2332 and MN184C).",

To this effect, SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Bimake, Huston, TX, USA), the cDNA template and 5 -ATG ATG RCC TGG CAT TCT-3 and 5 -ACA CGG TCG CCC TAA TTG-3 were utilized as the forward and reverse primers for ORF7, respectively. Real time PCR was then performed as follows: 2 min at 95 \u2022 C, followed by 40 cycles at 95 \u2022 C for 15 s and 61 \u2022 C for 1 min using Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). For use in quantification, a standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of viral RNA which contained 10 2 -10 7 copies/\u00b5L. Both positive and negative reference samples were run concurrently with the test samples. Viral loads were determined by plotting the Ct values against the standard curve. Melting curves were analyzed to verify the specificity of the PCR.",

Recently, several vaccine candidates, including a synthetic consensus PRRSV strain [27] , a chimeric PRRSV strain containing multiple ORFs DNA shuffled [46] [47] [48] and an intranasal live virus vaccine with adjuvant [49] induced various levels of heterologous protection in pigs. We have developed GP5-Mosaic vaccines that incorporate sequences derived from naturally circulating viruses. The data obtained from our GP5-Mosaic vaccinated pigs supports the Mosaic vaccine approach as an effective strategy to address PRRSV diversity. It has also been demonstrated that Mosaic T-cell vaccines have great potential for other viruses with extraordinary diversity, such as HIV [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . In an earlier study, we demonstrated the immunogenicity of GP5-Mosaic vaccines in swine and their ability to induce cross-reactivity, as shown by their broad recall responses ex-vivo, and conferred the partial protection they provide in pigs [29, 30] . The ability of the GP5-Mosaic vaccines to induce cross-protection in pigs against heterologous PRRSV strains was confirmed in the present study.",

The aa sequences were used to generate a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining method [24] . The GP5-Mosaic 1 was closer to VR2332 (93% aa identity), while GP5-Mosaic 2 was closer to MN184C (90% aa identity), which suggested that the two GP5-Mosaic sequences broaden the coverage to strains belonging to different lineages. Based on this analysis, a broader protection could be expected with GP5-Mosaic vaccines.

Thus, PBMC from GP5-Mosaic-vaccinated pigs expressed higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA in response to stimulation with VR2332 or MN184C strains, respectively, compared to those of the vector-control pigs. In contrast, PBMC from GP5-WT vaccinated pigs expressed higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA only when stimulated with VR2332. These data were consistent with those of our previous study where the GP5-Mosaic vaccine induced broad recall cellular responses, as measured by significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression in response to the four diverse Genotype 2 PRRSV strains tested, including VR2332, NADC9, NADC30 and SDSU73 [30] . The significant induction of IFN-\u03b3 is an important asset of a PRRSV vaccine, as IFN-\u03b3 reportedly plays a critical role in the control of and protection from PRRSV infection [56] . In addition, both the GP5-Mosaic and the GP5-WT vaccines induced relatively high levels of neutralizing antibodies in VR2332-challenged pigs.

In contrast, only the GP5-Mosaic-vaccinated group showed significantly lower viral loads in sera at 7 and 14 DPC than the vector-control group after the MN184C challenge. These data demonstrate that the GP5-Mosaic vaccine is capable of cross-protecting pigs against two divergent PRRSV strains (15% difference) while the GP5-WT vaccine only provided protection in pigs against the homologous strain. Furthermore, a similar pattern was found with respect to viral loads in tissues, where the GP5-Mosaic-vaccinated pigs had significantly lower viral loads in their lungs, TBLN, spleen, ILN and tonsils compared to the vector-control group after challenge with MN184C, while the GP5-WT group only showed slightly lower (numerically, but not significant) viral loads. In the VR2332 challenge experiment, both the GP5-Mosaic and GP5-WT vaccinates had significantly lower viral loads in tissues generally-the viral loads in the GP5-Mosaic vaccinates were significantly lower in their lungs, TBLN and tonsils, while viral loads in the GP5-WT group were significantly lower in their lungs, ILN and spleen, compared to the vector-control group. Similar protective effects were also demonstrated in the GP5-Mosaic vaccine vaccinates, where lower viral loads were detected in the BAL fluids or PAMs after MN184C challenge, further confirming the cross-protective capability of the GP5-Mosaic vaccine. Indeed, this is finding may be particularly relevant since PAMs are the primary target of PRRSV infection. Lung lesion scoring is an essential and crucial method to evaluate vaccine efficacy, as infection by PRRSV tends to increase susceptibility to coinfection with other virus or bacterial pathogens [57] [58] [59] which may result in more severe lesions and mortality. Pigs vaccinated with the GP5-Mosaic vaccine had significantly lower lung lesion scores than both the GP5-WT and vector-control groups after challenge with MN184C, while both the GP5-Mosaic and GP5-WT groups had lower lung lesion scores compared to the vector-control group in the VR2332 challenge experiment.",
