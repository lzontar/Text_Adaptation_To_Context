The magnitude of care variability in shock resuscitation, the confounding effects of disease severity and comorbidity, and the relative impact on sepsis survival are poorly understood. Objective: To evaluate usual care variability and determine the differential effect of observed and predicted fluid resuscitation volumes on risk-adjusted hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients in shock. Methods: We performed a retrospective outcome analysis of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to intensive care units using the 2013 Premier Hospital Database (Premier, Inc.). Observed and predicted hospital mortality were evaluated by observed and predicted day 1 fluid administration, using the difference in predicted and observed outcomes to adjust for disease severity between groups. Both predictive models were validated using a second large administrative database (Truven Health Analytics Inc.). Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU length of stay, and cost. Results: Among 33,831 patients, observed hospital mortality was incrementally higher than predicted for each additional liter of day 1 fluid beginning at 7 L (40.9% vs. 37.2%, p = 0.008). Compared to patients that received expected (\u00b1 1.5 L predicted) day 1 fluid volumes, greater-than-expected fluid resuscitation was associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality (52.3% vs. 45.0%, p < 0.0001) among all patients with shock and among a subgroup of shock patients with comorbid conditions predictive of lower fluid volume administration (47.1% vs. 41.5%, p < 0.0001). However, in patients with shock but without such conditions, both greater-than-expected (57.5% vs. 49.2%, p < 0.0001) and less-than-expected (52.1% vs. 49.2%, p = 0.037) day 1 fluid resuscitation were associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality.

With respect to identifying patients with shock, we attempted to address this by defining shock according to whether the subject was prescribed a vasopressor on hospital day 1 or 2. Furthermore, while isolating a higher risk population, patients with shock who require mechanical ventilation may represent a phenotypically distinct but heterogeneous subgroup. In separate analyses, we observed comparable associations in acutely resuscitated patients regardless of the need for ventilator support (unpublished data). Categorization of different shock states in administrative data is limited without access to patient-specific physiologic variables. For the purposes of the current analysis, we refer to all shock states as \"undifferentiated shock\" while acknowledging that bedside clinical assessment is likely to have informed a more precise etiology of shock that contributed to fluid resuscitation decisions. Finally, the present analysis does not distinguish between types of fluid administered that is the focus of ongoing studies. Though resuscitation with crystalloid rather than colloid fluids may have contributed to variability in DOF volumes [21] , fluid type has not been consistently associated with differences in shock resuscitation outcomes [21] [22] [23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1738, "end": 1742, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1846, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1847, "end": 1851, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1856, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study focused on early, guideline-informed DOF administration in shock. Future analyses are planned to evaluate DOF volumes for patients with delayed versus direct ICU admission, hospitals where patients receive very small volumes of DOF, the impact of specific shock states, as well as outcomes related to fluid administration beyond day 1 through hospital discharge. Further validation analyses in separate cohorts will be required to confirm the performance our novel risk-adjusted models. Institutional differences, including hospital size, teaching status, location, or geographic region, were not associated with variability in DOF resuscitation. While likely not a function exclusively of organizational or hospital-level factors, these data do not preclude that there may be significant individual-or team-level practice variability. Clinician-level variability in resuscitation decisions could also enhance future analyses of treatment variations. Taken together, these findings compellingly point to the importance of ongoing prospective clinical trials of physiologically informed, patientcentered fluid resuscitation for shock using dynamic measures of circulatory effectiveness rather than uniformly empiric strategies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Among mechanically ventilated patients with diverse etiologies of shock, this large retrospective analysis highlights extensive treatment variability including frequent greater-or less-than-expected fluid volume resuscitation.
