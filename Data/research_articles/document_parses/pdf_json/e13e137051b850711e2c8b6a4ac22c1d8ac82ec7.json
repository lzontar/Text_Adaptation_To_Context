Observations of the cosmic microwave background, galaxy distributions, and supernovae, among other media, support the assumption of isotropy at scales 100 Mpc. The recent detections of gravitational waves from merging stellar-mass binary black holes provide a new probe of anisotropy; complementary and independent of all other probes of the matter distribution in the Universe. We present an analysis using a spherical harmonic model to determine the level of anisotropy in the first LIGO/Virgo transient catalog. We find that the ten binary black hole mergers within the first transient catalog are consistent with an isotropic distribution. We carry out a study of simulated events to assess the prospects for future probes of anisotropy. Within a single year of operation, third-generation gravitational-wave observatories will probe anisotropies with an angular scale of \u223c 36 \u2022 at the level of 0.1%.",

Since \u039bCDM cosmology underlies our current understanding of the Universe, rigorous tests are required to validate this fundamental assumption. The Universe has been observed to be isotropic at scales 100 Mpc, with smaller-scale deviations considered to be statistically isotropic on an overall homogeneous structure produced by phenomena such as baryon acoustic oscillations or gravitational interactions [4] [5] [6] . Verifying the lack of large scale anisotropy in the Universe is important for the validity of the \u039bCDM cosmology.",

The most stringent measurements on the anisotropy of the Universe come from the cosmic microwave background, which generally show small-scale statistical deviations on the order of 10 \u22124 -10 \u22125 [13, 14] . Meanwhile, multiple studies hint at the existence of deviations from isotropy at large angular scales in the cosmic microwave background [15, 16] , supernovae [17, 18] and galaxy [19] distributions, as well as large bulk flows [20, 21] . While these inferences are speculative [e.g., [22] [23] [24] , they can be supported or contradicted by independent measures of the Universe's isotropy using gravitational-wave observations.",

We explore the future prospects of anisotropy measurements with gravitational waves. In Ref. [36] , a HEALPix [37] basis was adopted to parameterize the anisotropy of binary black hole mergers. In Ref. [38] , a two-dimensional correlation function was implemented (see also [39] ). Both analyses find results consistent with isotropy. In contrast, our method utilizes a spherical harmonic basis to define a probability distribution, providing results in terms of typical spherical harmonic functions. Our results are qualitatively similar to those of [36, 38] . However, there are some potential advantages to the spherical harmonic approach: the method lends itself straightforwardly to comparison with results from the cosmic microwave background, and it could be argued that at least some plausible deviations from anisotropy are more clearly visible in the spherical harmonic basis than the pixel basis, which emphasizes hot spots.",

All realizations of the detection probability at different times are then averaged to determine p det (\u2126). Figure 1 presents the detection probabilities (a) for a particular instant in time, (b) marginalized over the first observing run, and (c) marginalized over both the first and second observing runs. Then detection probability at any given time, as seen in Fig. 1(a) , is dominated by the antenna pattern functions of the interferometers. The marginalized detection probability skymaps in Fig.  1(b) and 1(c) , present more non-trivial behaviour due to the interplay of the antenna factors with the timedependence of the detectors' performance. In general, the probability of detection is smeared over the sky over extended periods of times, suppressing the lobe structure due to the antenna pattern function. Within our analysis of GWTC-1, only the combined detection probability is utilized. However the O1 detection probability is presented to highlight the strong selection bias present in O1 analysis. This was primarily due to both LIGO interferometers preferring a mid-declination due to their antenna pattern function maxima, and the consistency of a diurnal cycle during the first observing run [46] . These features are less clear in the combined detection probability due to the duration of the second observing run and improved duty cycle. To determine the detection probability as a function of the hyper-parameters, we compute",
