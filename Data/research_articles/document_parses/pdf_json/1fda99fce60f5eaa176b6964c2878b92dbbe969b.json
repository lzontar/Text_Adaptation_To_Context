            "text": "Lung ultrasound (LU) has a multitude of features and capacities that make it a useful medical tool to assist physicians contending with the pandemic spread of novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Thus, a LU approach to patients with suspected COVID-19 is being implemented worldwide. In non-critical COVID-19 patients, two new LU signs have been described and proposed: the \"waterfall\" and the \"light beam\" signs. Both signs have been hypothesized to increase the diagnostic accuracy of LU for COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia. In critically-ill patients, a distinct pattern of LU changes seems to follow the disease's progression, and this information can be used to guide decisions about when a patient needs to be ventilated, as occurs in other disease states similar to COVID-19. Furthermore, a new algorithm has been published, which enables the automatic detection of B-lines as well as quantification of the percentage of the pleural line associated with lung disease. In COVID-19 patients, a direct involvement of cardiac function has been demonstrated, and ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction might be present due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation often involved, as reported for similar diseases. For this reason, cardiac and diaphragm ultrasound evaluation is highly important. Last but not least, due to the thrombotic tendency of COVID-19 patients, particular attention should also be paid to vascular ultrasound. This review is primarily devoted to the study of LU in COVID-19 patients. We explain the significance of its \"light and shadows\", bearing in mind the context in which LU is being used: the emergency department and the intensive care setting. The use of cardiac, vascular, and diaphragm ultrasound is also discussed, as a comprehensive approach to patient care.",

            "text": "From the Wuhan district in Chinawhere the first cases of novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID- 19) were isolated in early January 2020the coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread to many other countries around the world. 1 The organ most affected by COVID-19 is the lung, where the virus enters the host's cells via the plasma membrane receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed most abundantly in the alveolar type II cells of the lungs. 2 Although SARS-CoV-2 also affects other body systems, 3 the pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 is of particular concern, since the leading cause of COVID-19 related death is severe acute respiratory failure. 4 The proper examination of a COVID-19 patient's entire respiratory system is therefore of utmost importance. Direct cardiac involvement has also been demonstrated, and diaphragm dysfunction is possible, as in other diseases similar to COVID-19. [5] [6] The characteristics of COVID-19 patients, who as a result of their pathology must be isolated and whose transfers must be limited, make ultrasound a useful tool for the bedside management of these patients. 7 In fact, in the early phase of the disease, lung ultrasound seems to show similar findings compared with computed tomography (CT), and its data is superior compared with that obtained by chest x-ray. 8 The ultrasound machine is also easy to cleanan essential characteristic during a pandemic. In marked contrast, the use of chest x-rays and CT scans may increase the risk of contamination and infection spread. 9 Notwithstanding, LU sonographers are divided in two fractions: those who believe in a specific LU pattern of COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia, and those who reject this hypothesis. [10] [11] This review is primarily devoted to the study of LU in COVID-19 patients. We explain the significance of its \"light and shadows\", bearing in mind the context in which LU is being used: the emergency department (ED) and the intensive care setting. The use of cardiac, vascular and diaphragm ultrasound is also discussed, in the context of a comprehensive approach to patient care.",

LU is also useful for monitoring the appearance of consolidations suggestive of atelectasis or superimposed pneumonia. [24] [25] Following a definite COVID-19 diagnosis, the proportion of the affected subpleural lung can be inferred from the proportion of the pleural line involved, and this quantification permits assessment of the severity and extension of the disease. In this scenario, emerging ultrasound methods based on computer-aided diagnosis are now available [26] [27] [28] and provide a further and potentially promising option in terms of faster data analysis and applicability to large sets of data, especially for novice sonographers with little or no previous LU experience. [29] [30] From the pathophysiological standpoint, severe COVID-19 is a disease with biphasic evolution, and two main phenotypes have been recognized, \"type 1\" and \"type 2\", reflecting different parenchymal alterations. 31 LU can help differentiate between the two types by demonstrating the degree of heterogeneity of aeration loss. 24 In \"type 1\", the aeration loss is homogeneously distributed among lung regions, with a more diffuse LU B-pattern, whereas in \"type 2\" loss of aeration and consolidations prevail in the dependent lung regions.",

As mentioned above, the specificity of the signs detected by LU in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not very high. 11 This constitutes a real risk of misdiagnosis or the non-recognition of other pathologies persisting during this pandemic. Pulmonary edema, bacterial pneumonia, other forms of viral pneumonia (e.g., cytomegalovirus or H1N1 virus), and pulmonary fibrosis continue to be causes of acute respiratory failure and must be kept in mind when making a differential diagnosis. Finally, it needs to be mentioned that LU cannot detect lesions deep within the lung parenchyma. 40 It should also be noted that although numerous papers have been published dealing with the use of LU during this COVID-19 pandemic, very few (if any) offer evaluations of diagnostic accuracy in terms of sensitivity and specificity. It is our opinion that lung abnormalities may develop before clinical manifestations. A patient with respiratory symptoms compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia and a suspect ultrasound pattern should be treated as COVID-19 positive until proven otherwise. However, the specificity of the nasopharyngeal swab is currently probably higher than any imaging test. Therefore, the only current test (pending the serological tests under development) is positivity to the RT-PCR assay. 21 ",

At the other end of the spectrum, in a COVID-19 H type patient under positive pressure mechanical ventilation, the cardiac ultrasound exam can detect cardiac insults directly connected to ventilation. In this case, the previously reported alterations secondary to mechanical ventilation 46 are found, with particular involvement of the right ventricle, leading to ventricular dilation, tricuspid insufficiency, reduced systolic right heart function, and possible secondary left heart compression ( Figure 4 ). Ventilator-induced heart dysfunction might even be present in a patient with no previous cardiac dysfunction. 47 A cardiac ultrasound exam should assess right ventricular dimensions and function (usually by recording tricuspidal annular plane excursion, TAPSE), tricuspid regurgitation, systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP), and the ratio of TAPSE over sPAP, a surrogate of right ventricular-arterial coupling. 47 Left ventricular function, although less influenced by inspiratory pressures, can be directly altered by right heart dysfunction and needs to be evaluated. Considering that 50% of COVID-19 pneumonia patients are reported to suffer from systemic arterial hypertension, 4 diastolic evaluation should always be carefully assessed.

CUS should be performed in the presence of neuromuscular blocking agent infusion, especially before pronation or changing postures, or prior to vascular cannulation. 50 Central venous cannulation in such patients may be tricky due to the physical interference caused by personal protective equipment (PPE), which could impair smooth manoeuvres and finger perceptual sensitivity. This may result in the rapid deterioration of a patient's condition, DVT, or the use of higher low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Furthermore, although specific guidelines on central venous cannulation have yet to be published, to the best of our knowledge , the need to avoid complications in patients ventilated with elevated positive pressure, as required in pneumothorax, is clear; hence, it seems rational to prefer the routine use of ultrasonography to guide the cannulation procedure rather than relying on landmark approaches.",

            "text": "Although this invasive support used in severe forms of COVID-19 is to be considered as lifesaving, prolonged use in this particular type of patient is directly associated with further complications (ventilatorassociated pneumonia, pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction, to name but a few). [51] [52] The decision to complete the weaning process must be taken with caution since extubation failure carries serious complications [53] [54] Recently published case series show that length of stay in the ICU and the duration of mechanical ventilation in severe cases of COVID-19 are almost always more than seven days, despite the fact that most of the patients are not elderly (mean age 63 years) and had few comorbidities other than COVID-19 respiratory distress. 4, 52 A long length of ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation (especially with prolonged use of neuromuscular blocking agents) can make weaning particularly challenging and increase the risk of ventilation-induced diaphragm dysfunction. 55 In patients deemed difficult to wean due to ultrasounddiagnosed ventilation-induced diaphragm dysfunction, the possibility of performing a tracheostomy must also be taken into consideration. Therefore, although the role of tracheostomy in COVID-19-related ARDS is still unknown, there are several reasons why it may be helpful in this setting. Firstly, a lower level of sedation is required, due to improved patient comfort, putting the patient in the best possible condition to generate effort. Furthermore, the reduction in airway resistance leads to reduced respiratory work. Both of which may facilitate the reduction in, and ultimately the liberation from, ventilatory support. [56] [57] However, these advantages must be weighed against the risks related to this aerosol-generating procedure. That said, a recently published case series reported no cases of medical team infection with the virus following the performance of twenty-eight tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients. 58 In recent years, much emphasis has been placed on the study of diaphragmatic dysfunction as a predictor of weaning failure (in non COVID-19 patients), and two sonographic indexes have been studied and validated for this purpose: diaphragmatic excursion (DE), and the diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF). DE is the maximum displacement of the diaphragm during breathing, quantified in M-Mode with a low-frequency probe (2) (3) (4) (5) , preferentially in the right subcostal area ( Figure 5 ). 59 An excellent diaphragm excursion measured with ultrasound and a long inspiratory time during the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may help predict successful weaning. At the same time, DE < 10 mm has been proved to be linked to a prolonged weaning period and increased weaning failure. [60] [61] [62] Since DE is only associated with lung volume during the inspiratory phase, and it cannot discern whether the excursion rate is due to the contractile activity of the diaphragm or due to the ventilator's positive pressure, its application is only reliable during a T-piece or low level CPAP spontaneous breathing trial. 6 Diaphragm thickness (DT) can be assessed using a 10-15-MHz linear array transducer in the zone of apposition between the mid-axillary or anterior-axillary line, in the 8 th to 11 th intercostal space. 6, 63 The DTF is calculated as the difference between the end-inspiration thickness and end-expiration thickness divided by the end-expiration thickness ( Figure 6, supplemental video 3) . The DTF is also known as the \"ejection fraction\" of the diaphragm and can provide a reliable indicator of diaphragm function and its actual contribution to respiratory effort. For this reason, the DTF can be helpful in choosing the appropriate time for weaning (a DTF \u2265 30% is a robust predictor of weaning success in both SBTs and pressure support tests) and in the daily assessment of the ventilation support tailored to the patient. During mechanical ventilation, both decreases and increases from baseline DTF (due to excessive or insufficient muscle unloading) are strongly connected to the risk of prolonged ventilator dependence. 64 After the first few days, when total support in COVID-19 severe patients is often needed, targeting an inspiratory effort level may accelerate liberation from ventilation. 65 CONCLUSION Lung ultrasoundwhen in the hands of expertsis a useful abedside tool for the care of COVID-19 patients and its capacity to rule out involvement of the respiratory system is of particular value. LU experts can presently be divided into two categories: those who believe in a \"specific\" LU pattern in COVID-19 vs. those who are sceptic. Thus, LU constitutes an evolving area of interestone in urgent need of further, accurate data. Assessing diaphragmatic function with ultrasound undoubtedly supports the clinical management of COVID-19 patients during the weaning process. In ventilated patients, cardiac, vascular and lung ultrasound should always be evaluated together in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between lung and potential cardiac and vascular abnormalities.
