Producers emphasize improved growth by selecting genetically superior animals through increased milk yield and calf growth. Udder conformation and milk yield have been shown to impact calf preweaning ADG (Neville, 1962; Gleddie and Berg, 1968) . However, beef cows with poor udder conformation may decrease production by decreased calf BW at weaning and increased labor costs, leading producers to cull females with mammary problems. Cows with poor udder confirmation at calving are at greater risk of developing mastitis (DeGroot et al., 2002) . Although mastitis is more prevalent in dairy herds, it does affect 12% to 20 % of beef females (Haggard et al., 1983; Watts et al., 1986) , which reduces longevity within the cowherd. Mastitis-infected females have decreased milk production and altered milk components that effect overall calf growth (Crossman et al., 1950; Paape et al., 2000) . Research has shown defects in teat shape and size inhibits the calf's nursing ability thus negatively impacting intake and gain. Frisch (1982) reported a correlation between cows with long teats and high calf mortality; however, that same study concluded that a calf would survive if the cow had one functional teat due to dams with poor teat conformation having greater milk yield. In addition, Edwards et al. (2017) reported that milk production level did not influence calf BW at weaning and ADG preweaning. Thus, we hypothesized that cows classified with poor udders would produce calves with similar preweaning and postweaning growth. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of beef cow udder score within two calving seasons on preweaning and postweaning progeny performance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 381, "end": 396, "text": "(Neville, 1962;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 397, "end": 420, "text": "Gleddie and Berg, 1968)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 699, "end": 721, "text": "(DeGroot et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 819, "end": 841, "text": "(Haggard et al., 1983;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 842, "end": 861, "text": "Watts et al., 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1025, "end": 1048, "text": "(Crossman et al., 1950;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1068, "text": "Paape et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1213, "text": "Frisch (1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1488, "text": "Edwards et al.

Calves were also weighed, branded, and male calves were castrated. Calves were then moved with cows to native upland range pastures. At weaning, calves were weighed and vaccinated against bovine rotavirus-coronavirus clostridium perfringens types C and D and Escherichia. After weaning, March-born steer calves were placed in a drylot and consumed ad libitum hay for 2 wk postweaning after which they were transported to the West Central Research and Extension Center (WCREC). After weaning, May-born steers grazed subirrigated meadow with 0.45 kg supplement or received ad libitum hay with 1.8 kg supplement until approximately 1 yr of age then relocated to WCREC. Steers were then placed in a GrowSafe feeding system (GrowSafe Systems Ltd., Airdrie, Alberta, Canada) approximately 2 wks after arrival at WCREC. All steer BW was measured on two consecutive days before GrowSafe entry and again 10 d after GrowSafe entry to account for the acclimation period to the feeding system. The average of the 2-d BW after the acclimation period was considered the initial feedlot entry BW and data concerning feedlot performance (BW change, DMI, and ADG) was calculated from the average BW. All calves experienced a 21-d transition period allotted for a common finishing diet of 48% dry rolled corn, 40% corn gluten feed, 7% prairie hay, and 5% supplement. At feedlot entry, all calves were implanted with 14 mg estradiol benzoate and 100 mg trenbolone acetate (Synovex Choice, Zoetis). Approximately 100 d before slaughter, calves were implanted with 28 mg estradiol benzoate and 200 mg trenbolone acetate (Synovex Plus, Zoetis). March-born steer calves were managed similarly during finishing as the May-born calves; however, steer calves were fed as a group in drylot pens. Each year, steer calves were sent to a commercial slaughter facility (Tyson Fresh Meats, Lexington, NE) when estimated visually to have 1.3 cm fat thickness over the 12th rib.
