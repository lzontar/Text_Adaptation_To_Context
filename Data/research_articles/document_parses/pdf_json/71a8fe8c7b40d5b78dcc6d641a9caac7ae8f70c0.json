Purpuric, livedoid, and thrombotic-ischemic skin lesions observed in patients with COVID 19 have been considered as the cutaneous manifestations of obstructive vasculopathy developing during the course of the disease (4-7). Mazzotta and Troccoli (4) reported acro-ischemic lesions in a 13-year-old boy with COVID-19 while Magro et al observed purpuric lesions in three patients with severe COVID-19. Histopathology of these purpuric lesions showed thrombogenic vasculopathy, and C5b-9 and C4d accumulation. These findings suggest that, in addition to hypercoagulation, complement activation may play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. (6) . On the other hand, it has been speculated that structural and non-structural proteins of the SARS-Cov-2 bind to the porphyrin and create a complex, inhibiting the oxygen and carbon dioxide carrying capacity of hemoglobin. Accordingly, tissues that are not adequately oxygenated begin to be damaged and cause an intense release of cytokines. The cytokine storm caused by overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines activates the plasminogen activator inhibitor and complement system, causing endothelial damage and microvascular thrombosis (8, 9) .
