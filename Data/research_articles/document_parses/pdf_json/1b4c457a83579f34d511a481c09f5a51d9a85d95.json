This explains, for example, the ability of this class of compounds to improve functioning of heart muscle in patients with congestive heart failure. In the last several decades additional therapeutic uses of 75 compounds such as oleandrin have been recognized. These include the use of this unique molecule, and extracts of the oleander (Nerium oleander) plant, as effective therapeutics that range from cosmetic treatment of skincare problems (11) to the treatment of cancer (12) (13) (14) . Oleandrin has been recognized as the active principle ingredient in oleander extracts used in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of patients with cancer (15) .

A recent review described antiviral activities of cardiac glycosides against cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, chikungunya virus, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola virus, influenza virus and human 85 immunodeficiency virus (16) . We recently reported that oleandrin, a unique lipid-soluble cardiac glycoside obtained solely from Nerium oleander, has strong antiviral activity against HIV-1 and HTLV-1 (17, 18) . Importantly, in studies with HIV-1, a unique antiviral activity of oleandrin was observed in terms of producing viral progeny with a greatly diminished potential to infect new target cells (17). This decreased infectivity was due in part to a reduction in the envelope glycoprotein of progeny virus, which is essential 90 for viral infectivity. We also reported that oleandrin treatment of cells infected with HTLV-1 resulted in reduced infectivity of progeny virus particles. Oleandrin inhibited virological synapse formation and consequent transmission of HTLV-1 in vitro (18) . Collectively this research strongly suggested that oleandrin and defined plant extracts with this molecule have a strong potential against enveloped viruses. Because SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is also an 'enveloped' virus we reasoned that oleandrin could 95 be effective in reducing viral load in infected individuals via production of progeny virus with a significantly reduced potential to infect new target/host cells.",

As in our previous studies with other viruses, we found that oleandrin exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Prophylactic treatment of Vero cells with as little as 0.05 \u00b5g/ml resulted in a significant, 800-fold reduction in virus production, and the 0.1 \u00b5g/ml oleandrin dose resulted in a greater than 3,000-fold reduction in infectious virus as well as a similar reduction in viral RNA.

Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 hours after infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with the 0.5 \u00b5g/ml and 0.1 \u00b5g/ml doses causing greater than 100fold reductions measured at 48 hours, and the 0.05 \u00b5g/ml dose resulting in a 78-fold reduction.",

The potential role of oleandrin as an active principle ingredient in the botanical drug (PBI-05204) designed to treat malignant disease has been reported (12) (13) (14) 19) . The Phase I trial of PBI-05204, for example, included measurement of Cmax and t1/2 calculations for oleandrin after oral administration to cancer patients. The delayed oral administration of this candidate drug achieved 200 plasma concentrations of 2-4 ng oleandrin/ml, without significant adverse effects, at a dose determined to be appropriate for Phase II study. The measured half-life was variable at 8-13 hr, indicating that multiple daily administrations may be optimal for maximum benefit. Our unpublished studies have shown that sublingual administration of oleandrin as an extract of Nerium oleander offers facile, safe and rapid plasma concentrations of oleandrin that surpass those achieved after oral administration. This is not surprising 205 because oral administration of oleandrin results in cleavage of the molecule in liver tissue to the much less active metabolite oleandrigenin.",
