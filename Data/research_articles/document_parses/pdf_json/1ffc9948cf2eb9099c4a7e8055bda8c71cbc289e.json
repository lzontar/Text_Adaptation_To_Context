It was added to local standard therapy consisting of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and, when used as initial therapy, recipients had a significant reduction in the overall death rate and intubation rate, compared with a matched control group who received standard treatment alone. The control group, however, had lower rates of steroid use at lower mean doses, making definitive conclusions difficult [58] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 647, "end": 651, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TREATMENT"}, {"text": "Anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapies include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and convalescent-phase serum and plasma exchange. Corticosteroids were widely used for SARS therapy. Preliminary results demonstrate decreasing virus loads and increasing antibody titers during the second week of illness, at a time when the respiratory disease typically progresses [14] . These results suggest that lung damage in patients with SARS-CoV infection may be immune mediated and provides the rationale for corticosteroid therapy. Pathological findings are consistent with cytokine dysregulation and provide further support for the theory that lung damage is immune mediated [52] . Initial case reports described resolution of fever and improvements in oxygenation and radiographic appearance in some patients treated with ribavirin and corticosteroids [59] . Subsequently, clinicians noted that cases in many patients progress despite receiving treatment with corticosteroids, and higher doses or pulsed steroid regimens were required as rescue therapy [60, 61] . A trial comparing early use of pulsed versus nonpulsed corticosteroids did not note any difference in the requirement for ventilation or mortality, but it did reveal improvements in oxygenation and radiographic appearance [62] . Concerns with the use of prolonged, high-dose, and pulsed corticosteroid regimens in the treatment of a new viral infection have been raised [62] . Pathological studies have detected high virus loads in patients who died 150 days into their illness and suggest that persistent viral replication is occurring and likely contributes to the pathophysiology of lung damage in SARS-CoV infection [53] . The use of corticosteroids could potentially increase or prolong viral replication and thereby worsen disease. Corticosteroids are also associated with a number of wellknown adverse outcomes including immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens, particularly those causing invasive fungal infections [63, 64] . In one multivariate analysis of 218 patients with SARS, use of pulsed corticosteroid therapy was strongly associated with mortality, although the results are difficult to interpret, because the sickest patients typically received pulsed corticosteroids as salvage therapy [65] . There have also been reports from China of avascular necrosis-a well-recognized complication of steroid therapyoccurring in patients who recovered from SARS [66] . IVIG consists of pooled antibodies from multiple donors. Although IVIG would not be expected to contain antibodies directed against SARS-CoV because of the low rate of background immunity in the population, it has been demonstrated to have other immunomodulatory properties and may down-regulate cytokine expression [67] . Convalescent-phase plasma samples have been used to treat SARS in Hong Kong and China and may be of value because, unlike standard IVIG preparations, high levels of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies would be present [68] . Finally, plasma exchange was used as salvage therapy in Hong Kong, but no data exist with which to assess its efficacy [69] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 390, "end": 394, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 694, "end": 698, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 872, "end": 876, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1073, "end": 1077, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1081, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1310, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1454, "end": 1458, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1708, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2041, "end": 2045, "text": "[63,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2046, "end": 2049, "text": "64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2324, "end": 2328, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2492, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2811, "end": 2815, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 3025, "end": 3029, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 3151, "end": 3155, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Anti-inflammatory therapy."}, {"text": "SARS is a deadly new infectious disease with the ability to spread from person to person and from country to country via international air travel.
