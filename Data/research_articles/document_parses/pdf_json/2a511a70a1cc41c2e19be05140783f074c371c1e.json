Today, it appears as a threat to human civilization. Scientists and medical practitioners across the world are involved to trace out the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (also called 2019 novel coronavirus and referred as 2019-nCoV), its transmission route, cause of pathogenicity, and possible remedial action. In this work, we aim to find out the origin, evolutionary pattern that led to its pathogenicity and possible transmission pathway of 2019-nCoV. To achieve the aims we conducted a large-scale deep phylogenetic analysis on the 162 complete Orthocoronavirinae genomes consisting of four genera namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, their gene trees analysis and subsequently genome and gene recombination analyses. Our analyses revealed that i) bat, pangolin and anteater are the natural hosts of 2019-nCoV, ii) outbreak of 2019-nCoV took place via inter-intra species transmission mode, iii) host-specific adaptive mutation made 2019-nCoV more virulent, and iv) the presence of widespread recombination events led to the evolution of new 2019-nCoV strain and/or could be determinant of its pathogenicity.",

Phylogenetic analysis of Betacoronavirus genomes revealed that the five subgenera clustered separately (Fig. 2) Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) belongs to Sarbecovirus subgenus (Fig. 2) . Sarbecoviruses formed three distinct clades, where Clade 1 consists of only bat as host species. In Clade 2, host species are bat, human and civet. Similarly, in Clade 3 the host species are bat, human, pangolin and anteater, and it depicts bat-CoV-RaTG13 (NCBI Acc no. Mn996532) is closest to CoV humans, which was evolved by the recombination of bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45 strains. The clades analysis clearly asserts bat, pangolin and anteater are the natural reservoir of 2019-nCoV, and transmission from bat /pangolin/anteater to humans took place through intermediate organisms (Cui et al., 2019; York, 2020) . Furthermore, this phylogenetic tree reveals Betacoronavirus sequences are conserved in their respective hosts after acquiring adaptive mutation (e.g. all bat hosts clustered in Clade 2 and human hosts are in Clade 3) (Lu et al., 2020) .",

Five gene trees namely orf1ab, spike (S), envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) were used for gene tree analysis (Figs. 3-7) . Except N gene tree (Fig. 6) , other four gene trees have shown similar evolutionary pattern with respect to their subgenera and were in concordance with their genome tree. This observation implies that the Betacoronavirus genome evolution is influenced by the genes' evolution. Further deep analysis found, though subgenera-wise four gene trees are similar, but within subgenera there are widespread phylogenetic incongruences (Jeffroy et al., 2006) . This result led us to hypothesize that HGTs and/or recombination had occurred among Betacoronaviruses in the past that are caused to evolve new strains including the emergence of pathogenic lineages. However, it was found that N gene tree has significant topological difference with other gene trees. This might be possible as gene tree differs species tree for various analytical and/or biological reasons (Degman et al., 2009; Som, 2013; . We conducted both genome (Betacoronavirus) and gene recombination analysis using RDP5 package (Martin et al., 2015) . The genome recombination analysis detected 21 putative recombination signals (Table 1) . Recombination results show that major recombination events took place between Clade 2 and Clade 3 of Sarbecovirus (Table 1) . Gene recombination analysis found there are widespread recombination events in orf1ab and S proteins (Table 2) . M and N proteins reported few recombination events and envelope (E) protein did not show any recombination event.",

In a similar line, a recent article by Lu et al. (2020) outbreak also happened in the same time interval of 17 years in 2019 and also in the same winter season. Further, evolutionary studies have shown that 2019-nCoV is genetically distance from SARS-CoVs with 88~96% sequence similarity between them (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020; Lu et al., 2020) . So the open question is which factors made 2019-nCoV is highly pathogenic: mutation, recombination, structural changes of spike protein, combination of multiple factors, or something else which needs to be explored. Thus, further studies on detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genomes, particularly the spike protein sequences and structures, as well as the receptors for the individual novel coronaviruses will enable to understand the origin, pathogenicity and mechanism behind interspecies jumping at the molecular level, which will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events.",
