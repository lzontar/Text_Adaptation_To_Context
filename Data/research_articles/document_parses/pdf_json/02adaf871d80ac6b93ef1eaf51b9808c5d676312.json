Two PRRSV receptors have already been identified on PAM. The glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate is a PRRSV receptor that is involved in PRRSV attachment 6 and porcine sialoadhesin is essential for both PRRSV attachment and internalization. 4 PRRSV attachment to porcine sialoadhesin on PAM is mediated by sialic acids potentially present on the viral glycoproteins. 7 PRRSV infection is characterized by reproductive failures in sows and respiratory problems in pigs of all ages. 1, 8, 9 PRRSV causes major economical losses in swine farms. Vaccination of both sows and young piglets is frequently performed to prevent this disease, however there are some problems associated with the currently used vaccines. Inactivated vaccines are safe to use in sows, becuase these vaccines do not induce reproductive failure, but their capacity to induce a protective immunity against challenge with wild-type virus has been questioned, especially in naive pigs. [10] [11] [12] Attenuated live vaccines have been proven to be effective in inducing protective immunity upon challenge with virulent PRRSV. 13, 14 However, they only protect against virus-induced disease if the challenge virus is genetically and antigenically similar to the vaccine virus. 13, 15 Only some degree of protection against heterologous strains is observed. 16 Further, there are concerns about the safety of these attenuated vaccines. Reversion of vaccine virus to virulence has been shown to occur causing major problems. 17 They can themselves spread, change genetically and be the cause of reproductive disorders. Due to the highly variable nature of RNA viruses and more specific of PRRSV, one of the major challenges of future vaccine research is to make vaccines that are safe to use and either are capable of inducing protective immunity toward the antigenically heterogenous array of viruses that are circulating, or can be quickly adapted to new circulating virus strains that are antigenically different.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 81, "end": 83, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 84, "end": 85, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 178, "end": 180, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 181, "end": 182, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 417, "end": 420, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 421, "end": 424, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 425, "end": 428, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 583, "end": 584, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 670, "end": 671, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 796, "end": 797, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 910, "end": 912, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 913, "end": 915, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 916, "end": 917, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1386, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1391, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1396, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1526, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1529, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1673, "end": 1676, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1677, "end": 1679, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1753, "end": 1755, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1919, "end": 1921, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Development of inactivated vaccines that are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies would be one good strategy, as (1) the presence of neutralizing antibodies was previously shown to protect towards challenge and virus-induced disease, [18] [19] [20] (2) inactivated vaccines cannot induce disease by themselves and are thus safe to use, and (3) inactivated vaccines can rapidly be adapted to new circulating virus variants.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 241, "end": 245, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 246, "end": 250, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 251, "end": 255, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "In this study, we wanted to investigate if neutralizing antibodies can be induced in pigs upon vaccination with an inactivated vaccine, and if vaccinated pigs were virologically protected towards challenge with wild-type PRRSV.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Three different inactivated vaccines were used in the experiments: one based on a commercial, European type attenuated vaccine virus, one based on Marc-145 grown Lelystad virus (5 th passage) and one based on porcine alveolar macrophage grown Lelystad virus (13 th passage).
