Blood-feeding by mosquitoes on vertebrate hosts is initiated by probing, which results in physical damage to the epithelium and vasculature as well as simultaneous introduction of virus and MSP into the cutaneous layers of the skin. [33] [34] [35] [36] MSP contains biologically active proteins that modulate host hemostasis and immune responses, which in turn facilitate blood-feeding and virus transmission. [37] [38] [39] The effects of MSP on mosquito-borne viral infections have been reviewed previously, and include 1) alterations to vascular permeability in DENV infection, 2) changes in cytokine and innate signaling profiles, such as decreased expression of IFN\u03b2/\u03b3, IL-2, and TLR3/7 and increased expression of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 in DENV, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and West Nile virus (WNV) infections, and 3) migration of monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and plasma cells to the site of infection for DENV, CHIKV, and WNV, as well as increased WNV neurovirulence. [38, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] Additionally, Aedes aegypti MSP increased the prevalence of disease signs and extended the viremic period in DENV-infected, humanized mice.

[59] In an attempt to further increase the clinical relevance of the dengue macaque model, we compared different viral infection modalities including live mosquito vector-mediated, ID inoculation of virus with and without MSP, and conventional SC viral inoculation, all using low-passage, i.e., near wild-type, contemporaneous DENV clinical isolates. In order to reduce the impact of variation in past exposure to MSP antigens, all animals in the study were primed by multiple, sequential exposures to uninfected, feeding Ae. aegypti before being exposed to DENV.
