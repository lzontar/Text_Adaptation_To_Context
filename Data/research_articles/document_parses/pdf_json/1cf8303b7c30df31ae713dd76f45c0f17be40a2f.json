They are one each from Spain, Israel, India and Peru, and 9 genome sequences from the USA (Fig. 38 1).

The probe had 1 bp mismatch with sequence 67 MT159720 (2019-nCoV/USA-CruiseA-4/2020) and the forward primer had 1 bp mismatch with sequence 68 LC534419 (SARS-CoV-2/Hu/Kng/19-437 RNA from Japan). 69 The protocol for diagnostic detection laid out in Berlin on January 17, 2020 consists of RdRp and E gene 70 qRT-PCR using one probe (P2) specific for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and a generic probe (P1) that cross-reacts 71 with SARS-CoV and bat SARS-related CoVs, in addition to SARS-CoV-2. The other set of primers and 72 probe is specific for the E gene of SARS-CoV-2. In Canada, Public Health Ontario uses these protocols 73 with E gene amplification for detection and RdRp gene amplification for confirmation 7 . The RdRp gene 74 primers and probe were 100% identical to the biding sites of 100% (388/388) available RdRp gene 75 sequences of SERS-CoV-2 deposited in GenBank. The E gene qPCR primers and probe were identical to 76 the biding site of 99.7% (375/376).

The primer and probe sequences are identical to all but one of 386 SARSfor C/T) which has 50% possibility aligning with \"C\" of the reverse primer. 90 Discussion 91 After looking at available primer and probe sequences, it appears as though at present (April 2020) most 92 sequences for the qRT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 largely match the current reported genomic 93 sequences. The three bp disparity between the Chinese CDC N gene primers and strains isolated from 94 five different countries including Spain, Israel, India, Peru and America highlights the importance to 95 continue monitoring the performance of the PCR protocol and re-evaluate them at the least in silico 96 when more sequences become available. 97 Given the challenges in obtaining clinical samples from which virus may be detected and variations 98 between laboratories, even single bp mismatches represent errors of 5% in the primer sequence and 99 depending on their location and the nature of the substitution, these could affect performance of the 100 reaction and yield false negative results 8 . Indeed, a single base pair mismatch was shown to reduce 101 sensitivity in a qRT-PCR test kit distributed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic 9 . This evaluation was on 102 primer and probe sequences only. The other characteristics, e.g. annealing temperature, primer dimer 103 and hair pin forming possibility of the primers and probes were not evaluated. Given substantial 104 contributions to qRT-PCR efficiency from these factors, sequence changes represent a point of 105 importance when considering diagnostic tests. 106 SARS-CoV-2 likely mutates at a rate similar to the first SARS coronavirus, over 60 mutations per genome 107 per year 10 . It is important then, that continued sharing of sequencing data becomes increasingly 108 important as the pandemic currently shows few signs of slowing down and could remain in circulation 109 for a number of years. Already there are over 8,000 sequences in the GISAID hCoV-19 database (as of around the world are rushing to acquire sufficient testing capacity and develop containment 117 strategies 14 , it will be particularly important to ensure that design of primers and probes search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane 122 Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, therapeutic drugs and vaccines for Severe 123 Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel 124 coronavirus (2019-nCoV), in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 125 Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 126As of April 6, 2020, a total of 447 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 pathogen) sequences were available from the 127 GenBank, including 375 complete or close to complete genome with greater than 29,161 bp (hereafter 128 name as full genome), 72 partial genome sequences with 87bp to 1,411 bp. 129All 375 full-length sequences were downloaded and used to create a custom SARS-CoV-2 genome 130 database using a bioinformatic software Geneious version 11.1 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). 131 PCR protocols were collected from publication of WHO, US CDC and other literatures.
