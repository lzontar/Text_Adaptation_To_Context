            "text": "Since the onset of the COVID-19's global spread we have been following the debate around contact tracing apps-the techenabled response to the pandemic. As corporations, academics, governments, and civil society discuss the right way to implement these apps, we noticed recurring implicit assumptions. The proposed solutions are designed for a world where Internet access and smartphone ownership are a given, people are willing and able to install these apps, and those who receive notifications about potential exposure to the virus have access to testing and can isolate safely. In this work we challenge these assumptions. We not only show that there are not enough smartphones worldwide to reach required adoption thresholds but also highlight a broad lack of internet access, which affects certain groups more: the elderly, those with lower incomes, and those with limited ability to socially distance. Unfortunately, these are also the groups that are at the highest risks from COVID-19. We also report that the contact tracing apps that are already deployed on an opt-in basis show disappointing adoption levels. We warn about the potential consequences of over-extending the existing state and corporate surveillance powers. Finally, we describe a multitude of scenarios where contact tracing apps will not help regardless of access or policy. In this work we call for a comprehensive and equitable policy response that prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable, protects human rights, and considers long term impact instead of focusing on technology-first fixes.",

            "text": "Communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, spread between people in close proximity. This is why, in addition to social distancing, business closures, and wearing masks, public health interventions include contact tracing. It is a method of identifying people that were in physical proximity with a positive patient, so that they can be isolated, tested and, if necessary, treated. Traditionally, contact tracing has been done by human tracers, who interview infected patients about all their recent contacts and then follow up with them. Human tracers engage directly with their interviewees and are trained to address any potential health and confidentiality concerns. 1 However, this approach has two drawbacks. First, low recall: we humans tend not to remember all the people we were in close contact with during the period where we were potentially infectious (up to two weeks before onset of symptoms 2 ). It is also impossible to identify strangers we have been close to on the bus or in the store, etc. And second, slow process: human tracers have to reach out to all the reported contacts and talk to them. This can be a painstakingly slow process and it might well take days to get a hold of all the people we listed. Smartphone based contact tracing promises to solve both of these limitations. If it works as intended we would not have to rely on our faulty memory. The app could \"remember\" the people we do not even know, as long as both we all have compatible smartphones and installed the app. Once we are diagnosed, the app would instantly notify all our contacts who meet certain criteria, such as duration of contact, closeness, etc. and recommend testing and/or isolation, But of course only if everyone has a smartphone, the app, and reliable internet access.",

It is paramount we ensure that any attempted technological interventions to the pandemic do not exacerbate existing inequalities and are, instead, a part of an equitable public health response. While it might appear that smartphone based contact tracing is a promising approach in selected geographies, we must not forget that the pandemic is, by the very nature of how much we are connected, a global problem and not one of separate societies.

The latest GSMA report (see Figure 1 ) further illustrates large differences between regions: in Sub-Saharan Africa only 26 out of 100 people have a mobile Internet subscription; for comparison, in Europe the number is 76 out of 100. Internet connectivity (necessary for contact tracing apps to work) is similarly unevenly distributed, leaving nearly half of the world's population, 3.5 billion people, without access. 9 These staggering differences are related to the wealth of countries measured here in GDP per capita, see Figure 2 . In the poorest countries only one out of 10 people have a smartphone. This number is eight to nine times higher in the wealthiest countries meaning only one or two out of 10 people do not have one.",

It is, however, quite clear that this success rate cannot be achieved in countries where less than 60% of the population owns a smartphone regardless of adoption levels and efficiency of the app itself.

A single phone can be shared by an extended family or, in rural areas, a neighborhood or a village. (...) Outside of larger cities, fewer Sierra Leoneans have cell phones. But in Freetown and Kenema, the capital city of the Eastern Province, I met many people who had more than one. 15 The consequences of this are two-fold. First, the data on penetration rates of smartphones and mobile internet users are potentially overly optimistic: 20% penetration does not mean two out of ten people have one smartphone each, but it might mean that 1 out of 10 has two devices. Second, even the smartphones might not be relevant for contact tracing efforts as they do not correspond to one person but are instead shared among multiple individuals: 20% penetration does not mean that two out of then people have one smartphone each and the others have none. Instead, it might mean that a group of ten people share two devices and use them each at different times.",

This is much further than the distancing advisory of 2 meters (6ft). Current app proposals rely on a combination of (1) lowering the transmission power to prevent such long distance reception and further (2) relying on Bluetooth signal strength measurement to identify short-distance proximity events -they assume a strong signal means a short distance while a weak signal means two people were further away from each other. Unfortunately for contact tracing, this is not really the case. For example, the human body weakens the Bluetooth signal quite well, which means that the app's distance estimate between two people talking to each other will be vastly different depending on whether their phones are in their front or back pockets. At the same time, Bluetooth signals can go through walls so your neighbors (both next door and up/down-stairs) are likely to be logged as a close contact. In fact, a few years ago we tested treating Bluetooth received signal strength' as a proxy for physical distance in ideal conditions, i.e. we used the exact same model phones, we placed them in an empty room (no human body attenuation) and various distances and found that it was very difficult to tell whether two phones were 1 meter (3 ft) apart (crucial for epidemic measurements) or 3 meters (9 ft) apart (much less relevant for transmission, as most virus-carrying droplets will fall within 2 meters, or 6ft). 27 These problems will be even more difficult to solve with different phone models and different places where people carry them. Solving them will require smartphone producers to closely collaborate with Google and Apple -in each phone model the relationship between signal strength and distance will be a bit different. The code that translates signal strength to distance will need to be further calibrated for different scenarios. This translation will be different outside vs inside, for phones carried in front pockets vs back pockets, backpacks vs purses, and so on.",

False positives happen when the app reports a potential exposure to the virus even though such exposure was very unlikely, for example the phones detected each other through a wall. These two kinds of errors have the potential to further drive societal inequities as they affect certain groups of people unequally. False negatives will mean that those who do not have smartphones or choose not to install the app might find it more difficult to obtain testing and adequate healthcare.

Most of the academic work with this data revolves around simulations of spread dynamics. Rather than tracking who exactly was exposed, academics are interested in probabilistic estimates of how quickly the disease will spread, how many people will be infected, and so on. When we do focus on the risk to particular individuals, we get to run dozens of thousands of simulations to estimate the probability of each person being infected. Only when the system is deployed in the real world, will we have a chance to learn whether this probability corresponds to real infections well enough to support manual contact tracing efforts without overwhelming the system with false positives.

In this ideal scenario, adoption of any contact tracing technology would be voluntary, based on informed consent and trust in the apps' efficacy and the institutions governing them. This trust should be built through guarantees regarding transparency (of code, of operation, but also of decision making processes and public procurement), legality, well enforced data protection standards, and accountability. 31 However, we have seen both democratic and non-democratic governments rushing to implement tracing apps and centralised data collection systems (see https://privacyinternational.org/examples/apps-and-covid-19). Many initially proposed tools suffer from mission creep and are designed and/or operated by private companies, lacking public oversight, a defined legal framework and adequate privacy protections. 32 The result of this situation is a lack of public trust expressed in a low willingness to opt in and install the existing apps. A poll from April 2020 shows that Americans have low levels of trust in tech companies, universities, insurance companies, and public health agencies. As a result, half of those who have smartphones in the US will not install a contact tracing app. 33 Experiences from around the world seem to reflect these findings. The first country to roll out an official and voluntary contact tracing app was Singapore with TraceTogether. Popular app uptake proved to be disappointing, despite promises of data minimisation and privacy safeguards, and the opening of the app source code. Six weeks after deployment only 1.1 million (or less than one in five) residents installed it. That is far below the minimum goal of 75%, set by their national response team. 34 Norway's experience was similar. Two weeks after the release of their contact tracing app it had 860,000 users, corresponding to only 16% of the population. 35 Such low adoption in small populations known for high levels of trust in their governments does not inspire confidence in adoption elsewhere. Unfortunately, we do not have accurate data about active users of other tracing apps. Apple does not publish download statistics and Google only provides a rough estimate. And even with that data we still would not know how many downloads actually translate into active users. Our approximations presented in Figure 7 show that adoption is, in fact, very low across the board (see Section Materials and Methods at the end of this article to find out how we arrived at these estimates). At the time of this analysis (mid-May 2020), we clearly see that only two countries, Israel and Czech Republic, might have reached the 60% threshold of installs that is commonly referred to as the minimum for tracing to work, and that is only if we make the most optimistic assumption.",

In the latter case an app might not be legally mandatory and still based on consent, but that consent is not meaningful if the reward is too high for citizens to actually be able to say no. While international law allows for limitations to civil liberties during a public health crisis, including on the right to privacy, it also clearly defines how the government should implement such limitations to balance rights and prevent abuses. 39 It is yet unclear whether directly or indirectly enforcing proposed tools would actually withstand legal tests. 40 A coercive approach is also problematic if it ignores the fact that many people might not have internet access or smartphones as shown in Assumption 1. Notwithstanding these concerns, the Indian government made their contact tracing app mandatory for workers across the country and for everybody in select cities (resulting in 90 million downloads corresponding to less than 7% of the population). 41 Poland's quarantine app is obligatory despite its privacy flaws. 42 Calls for mandatory app use are gaining traction in Singapore 43 and Italy. South Korea requires foreigners to install a tracking app when entering the country. 44 Kazakhstan, 45 Russia, 46 and the Gulf States 47 require installing tracking tools as a prerequisite for people to leave the house during quarantine. To understand what mandating really means for people's lives, it is worth looking at enforcement actors and practices. India 48 and Poland 49 task the police with enforcing tools through fines or even jail time. In Russia, the enforcement is built into the quarantine app: failure to comply with the instructions given by the app automatically results in a fine, even if it's caused by a bug in the app itself. 50 We also have major concerns about how enforcement will look like for people who do not have phones or the Internet to comply, or for people whose economic situation forces them to keep leaving the house. Looking at patterns of quarantine enforcement to date, we can expect that extended police powers will also aggravate already dire patterns of over-policing, racism, 51 and police brutality. 52 The future of the surveillance infrastructure Finally, we are also seeing how the crisis is used as a cover to further extend surveillance powers and introduce unrelated infrastructure often targeting the already over-surveilled. Reportedly, China intensified hacking campaigns against the Uighur community 53 and started installing cameras outside and sometimes inside people's homes. 54 Israel requires Palestinians who want to ensure the validity of their permit to stay in Israel to install an app giving the military access to their phone data. 55 Moscow introduced drones to police quarantine orders 56 and Paris has adopted AI tools to assess mask adoption on public transport. 57 The US Senate has passed a law allowing the FBI to access the browsing history of all Americans without a warrant 58 in times where we all have to rely on the internet to get on with our lives. And finally, the police in South Korean and Hong Kong track people's movements with wristbands, a tool often considered as a potential alternative to apps including in 8/15 5/20/2020 Total COVID-19 tests per 1,000 vs. GDP per capita",

In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. introduced the Patriot Act to drastically extend their surveillance apparatus with the goal of curbing terrorism. We do not know how effective it was in its stated objective, but, through the Snowden leaks, we do know that it has been widely abused to encroach on the rights of people worldwide. 61 19 years after the attacks, the Patriot Act has still not been repealed, setting a dangerous precedence.

Why do we need so many? Without the tests we will not know whose contacts to trace. Moreover, if we cannot test these contacts, we will need to isolate them. At this stage of the epidemic, with a sizable infected population, isolating all contacts would not be much different than a complete lockdown.

The lack of tests and limited access to those available drives the health divide rooted in social status and economic differences even further. There are three factors at play: first, the economic feasibility of ceasing to work or working from home while isolating; second, the efficacy of staying at home in order to slow down the spread; and third the ability to isolate at all. Wealthier people will isolate at their homes (or summer houses 64 ), but not everybody can afford to not work, or work from home. WHO guidelines state that individuals expected to stay at home ...need to be provided with health care; financial, social and psychosocial support; and basic needs, including food, water, and other essentials. The needs of vulnerable populations should be prioritized. 65 Unfortunately, this is not the reality for a large fraction of the world's population. The latest brief of the International Labour Organisation reminds us that the 2 billion informal workers worldwide are faced ..with an almost unsolvable dilemma: to die from hunger or from the virus. 66 This holds also true in richer countries. In the US, only two months into non-essential business closures, food insecurity has reached an unprecedented level. According to the COVID Impact Survey and the Survey of Mothers with Young Children, 67 two in five households run by mothers with children up to 12 years old could not afford enough food, more than a two-fold increase compared to the same time of year in 2018.",

Seda G\u00fcrses emphasises the existence of two distinct classes in the society. The delivery class delivers the goods and health care to the receiver class. 76 Individuals in the latter can afford to stay at home and will neither be at a heightened risk of the virus, nor exposed to the inherent privacy risks of running surveillance apps on their phones. The delivery class, on the other hand, will be expected, or even forced, to install the apps and carry the biggest burden both of the pandemic but also of privacy loss, as well as intensified scrutiny and surveillance from law enforcement. The voices of the delivery class are strikingly absent in the debates on how to design public health responses in general and technology in particular.",

The Top10VPN data also reports if each app has an iOS version. If it does, we use Statcounter to obtain the estimate of Android market share in that country. We assume, that the same fraction of iOS users installs the app as Android users. We then report the pessimistic estimate as the lower bound reported by Google Play Store plus the corresponding number of installs from iOS users, and the optimistic estimate as upper bound plus the corresponding number of iOS installs, both divided by the country's population.",
