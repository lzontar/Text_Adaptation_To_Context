Invasive ventilation is recommended for these patients. NIV may be considered to prevent further deterioration and intubation needs in patients with mild-to-moderate hypercapnic ARF due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or exacerbation of a chronic respiratory disease secondary to H1N1 infection in the absence of pneumonia, multi-organ failure (MOF), or refractory hypoxemia. It can also be used to prevent postextubation respiratory failure in patients with resolving ARDS secondary to H1N1 infection, preferably when patients are no longer contaminated.",

Examples of leaks of unfi ltered gas include: (1) situations where no bacterial/viral fi lters are available and therefore Staff should be trained in infection control. Gown, gloves, and eye protection should be worn for all aerosol-generating procedures. The use of an FFP3 respirator instead of a surgical mask may be advisable until there are data that allow better assessment of the risk associated with the various procedures. Patients should be managed in negative-pressure single rooms with anterooms, where this condition is available. If such facilities are not available, the patients should be cared for in standard single rooms or, if there is no other option, in cohorted groups. A nonvented patient mask or helmet should be used. Although bilevel pressure support (BiPAP) NIV is likely to be preferred, CPAP ventilation may be used in certain circumstances. A high-effi ciency bacterial/viral breathing system fi lter (BS EN 13328-1) should be used between the nonvented mask and the expiratory port and at the outlet of the ventilator. Expiratory port options include a whisper swivel or controlled leak valve (each with a proximal fi lter, as above). Ideally, expiratory fl ow should be directed through a single jet away from patients and staff. NIV masks should be applied to the patient's face and secured before the ventilator is turned on. Double-tube circuit ventilators may be advantageous. The ventilator should be turned off before removing the close-fi tting mask or when lifting the mask away from the face (e.g., for mouth care or fl uid sips). Water humidifi cation should be avoided.",
