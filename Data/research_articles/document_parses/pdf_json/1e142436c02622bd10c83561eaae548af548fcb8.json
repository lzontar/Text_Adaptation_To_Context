The Canadian Association of Head & Neck Surgical Oncology (CAHNSO) has recently published thoughtful guidelines for the management of patients with head and neck cancer during COVID-19. 6 In combination with other guidelines and expert opinions, suggestions on how to proceed with our patients are accumulating for COVID-19. [7] [8] [9] Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) developed pandemic clinical practice guidelines in 2009 which have been recently updated to reflect the province's strategy for COVID-19. 10,11 A priority classification system is currently used to triage resources to oncology patients with the greatest needs. Most head and neck cancer care remains at the highest level of priority, and the need to provide ongoing head and neck oncology care remains clear. However, application and operationalization of these various guidelines can differ across institutions and real-world experience is needed. This paper describes the regional institutional practices in Toronto, Canada and Wuhan, China, and how we have operationalized such guidelines. We outline key practice considerations for personal protective equipment (PPE), triaging and decision making for new referrals, ongoing surgical care, and follow-up practices from the perspective of two large cancer institutions with experiences in pandemic management.",

Indications for endoscopy must be made clear, as to avoid any unnecessary procedures, and to minimize exposure to head and neck surgeons. In many clinical scenarios, endoscopy can be delayed or avoided in the pandemic setting with increased reliance on history, other physical examination maneuvers, and imaging. In Wuhan, airborne precautions were taken during all head and neck examinations. To protect health care providers, the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery has stated that airborne precautions should be taken for all aerosolizing procedures including, but not limited to, the use of N95 respirators, face shields or goggles, gloves, gowns, disposable medical caps, and shoe covers. 17 In cases of limited PPE, avoidance or deferral of full physical examination may be warranted.",

We have restricted access to the operating room to a single entry and exit point. A nurse observes all donning and doffing of PPE while providing support and instructions to ensure high quality and compliance. Moreover, there are no trainees in the room for portions of the procedure that may lead to aerosolized exposure. For instance, if a patient is undergoing an oral cavity resection and neck dissection, the neck dissection is performed first with involvement of trainees, while the oral cavity resection is performed separately with only staff physicians in the room. As an additional measure, within the University of Toronto hospitals, we are currently saving N95 masks. Efforts have been put toward developing a process for N95 mask re-sterilization utilizing equipment similar to other centers in the United States, though this is not yet needed nor standardized across Ontario. 18, 19 3 | TRIAGING NEW REFERRALS Ontario has one of the most mature and regionalized head and neck cancer programs in the world, with all care being provided at one of seven designated cancer centers. [20] [21] [22] [23] To meet the needs of this pandemic, both Wuhan and Toronto initiated a centralized system within their regionalized cancer centers for the intake of new referrals. For example, all new referrals to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Odette Cancer Centre in Toronto are now first virtually reviewed by a team consisting of medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists. Together, the determination is made in regard to any additional testing required prior to patient consultation. If at all possible, patients are seen virtually via the Ontario Telehealth Network (OTN), which allows for two or three-way audio with video support, allowing family members to be present, even if not physically with the patient. This is particularly important within our elderly population, minimizing social contacts, while maintaining physical distancing. The virtual interaction through OTN is particularly useful if the physical examination will not change the next steps in management (ie, pathology review, discussion of treatment options, or where the need for additional imaging and testing remains). This step allows for the collection of information from patients, while reducing the risk of exposure with face-to-face consultations, and has been shown to be an effective avenue for patient care. 24 In circumstances that necessitates in person consultation, such as the need for biopsy, patients are seen in person.",

Both the CAHNSO as well as Wuhan University have held the view that surgical management should be offered when a worse outcome is expected should surgery be delayed more than 2 to 6 weeks. In practice this means operating largely on patients with advanced mucosal disease, high grade salivary malignancy with rapid progression, advanced melanoma, and other pathologies where surgery could be potentially curative. Salvage surgery is being approached with great caution given the poor oncologic results and necessity to limit institutional resource use where possible. 34, 35 The Stanford University group have recently outlined their stratification of urgency according to disease process and show general agreement with these suggestions. 36 Within the operating room, significant thought has been put toward minimizing exposure and conserving PPE. Resident trainees are either not involved in cases or are brought in only for portions of the procedure appropriate for their level of training. In head and neck oncology, clinical equipoise often exists between various treatment modalities. In an effort to limit operating room use and build intensive care unit capacity, for patients who could expect equivalent results for radiation or surgery, the former is preferred. An example is early stage glottic cancer, where transoral laser microsurgery has traditionally been discussed as a treatment option. As this is a high-risk aerosol generating procedure, with similar oncologic outcomes to primary radiotherapy, the latter is being preferentially used. Head and neck cancer sites must also consider the potential future need for primary radiation in the treatment of oral cancer. However, each patient must be managed on a case-by-case basis, while considering other possible side effects, such as chemotherapy and radiation induced immunosuppression.",

We recognize in certain cases this is not possible, and individual patient safety must be weighed, as well as the risk of increased aerosolization should an uncontrolled airway intervention be required. Our institutions have also elected to reduce manipulation of tracheostomies as much as possible. The use of non-fenestrated cannulas, delay of tracheostomy tube changes, and corking of deflated, cuffed tubes have been employed to facilitate this goal. 37, 38 From an adjuvant therapy perspective, both the radiation oncology and medical oncology services across Toronto hospitals are adapting their practices to help mitigate risk to head and neck patients with cancer in the wake of COVID-19. For instance, there has been increased consideration placed toward hypofractionated or accelerated radiation schema, as well as weekly outpatient cisplatin regimens for select cases; both with the goal of reducing hospital visits. In cases where a regionalized cancer center in Ontario is no longer able to safely offer cancer services, protocols are in place to transition care to another provincial care center.",

In Ontario, SARS resulted in many hospitals being closed for 6 weeks, leading to treatment delays and even longer wait times in an already strained system. With this crisis, however, came the opportunity to better cancer care delivery. The SARS pandemic highlighted the shortcomings of Ontario's public health system and helped catalyze initiatives to improve health care accessibility including regionalization of head and neck cancer care and the establishment of quality metrics. 39 Periods of immense stress on the health care system can ultimately drive system improvement. They are also periods of reflection on the capacity of a sometimes already stretched system. In Ontario, operating room use, and hospital occupancy, is generally high and reliant on efficient through-put. However, pre-COVID-19 there was very little allowance for large aberrations in volumes. With a large decrease in hospital capacity and operating room resources, surgical delays and rationing have been required.",
