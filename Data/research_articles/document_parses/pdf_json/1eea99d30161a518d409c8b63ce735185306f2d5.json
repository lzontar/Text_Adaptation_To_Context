Therefore, monitoring and maintaining the mental health of HCWs is crucial during a pandemic. Moreover, a solid understanding of factors that influence HCWs' mental health is needed to develop and optimize protective measures. 13 Existing research on mental health of HCWs during a pandemic largely stems from the SARS outbreak at the beginning of this century. 14 Several studies conducted in Canada have demonstrated the risk of pandemic-related stressors to HCWs' .

For example, HCWs working in a clinical unit dedicated to the treatment of SARS patients experienced higher levels of stress than their peers. 15 Another study found low organizational support as well as distrust in equipment to be associated with emotional exhaustion and anger. 16 Moreover, a higher workload, assignment to unfamiliar tasks, health fears, and social isolation mediated the relationship between treating SARS patients and acute traumatic stress. 17 Although these studies can provide preliminary evidence, their generalizability to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is limited due to the peculiarities of each pandemic. Thus, timely research on mental health of HCWs during the current pandemic is needed. A first study was conducted in China by Lai et al. at the beginning of February 2020 among 1257 Chinese HCWs. These authors demonstrated that women, nurses, frontline workers, and those working in Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic, had elevated symptom levels of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and traumatic stress compared to men, physicians, second-line workers and those not working in Wuhan. 18 In contrast, a second Chinese study conducted by Li et al. at the end of February 2020 found that 214 individuals from the general public and 292 non-frontline nurses reported higher levels of vicarious traumatization than 234 nurses working at the frontline. 19 In a third Chinese study conducted between the end of February and the beginning of March, Zhang et al. reported that 927 medical HCWs had a higher prevalence of insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsives symptoms than 1255 non-medical HCWs. 20 Furthermore, being a woman was a significant predictor of insomnia, anxiety, and depression, and exposure to COVID-19 patients was a predictor of anxiety and insomnia. 20 However, a study among 470 HCWs in Singapore undertaken during the same period of time found the opposite, namely lower levels of stress-related symptoms in medical compared to non-medical HCWs. 21 Lastly, in a .

By conducting the first network analysis on mental health and associated factors during the pandemic, we were able to map relationships between several variables while controlling for their mutual influence. Here, we highlight some specific associations. While support by the employer was associated with anxiety and burnout, working in a COVID-19 ward was not. Exposure to COVID-19 patients was only associated with burnout. Hence, although we found group differences in mental health between frontline and non-frontline staff and between HCWs who have and have not been exposed to COVID-19 patients, these associations did not remain significant after adjusting for all factors within the network. Taken together, COVID-19 exposure only partially predicted burnout, while support by the employer was a significant predictor of both burnout and anxiety. The role of perceived support has been studied extensively in occupational and health psychology, 31 and its direct relationship with mental health of HCWs is well documented. 6, 7, 42 For example, as postulated by the job-demand-control-support model 43 , which has a broad empirical foundation, 44 support is not only important to well-being but reduces the mental strain caused by job demands such as, in this case, COVID-19 exposure. Moreover, the importance of support was also recently emphasized in a qualitative study on HCWs' concerns with regard to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 13 Another possible interpretation for the absence of individual effects of COVID-19 variables is that these effects were very small and thus did not survive regularization.

First, the cross-sectional nature of the study with a single period of data collection and no control group does not allow to draw conclusions about changes in symptoms. In other words, we do not know whether symptoms changed compared to before the pandemic, whether changes are a consequence of the pandemic, or whether HCWs reacted in a specific way different from the general population. These important questions need to be addressed by future studies with an appropriate design (e.g., within the frame of ongoing cohort studies). Second, given the non-targeted recruitment, our sample was likely not representative of HCWs in Switzerland. Moreover, the non-targeted recruitment might have introduced several kinds of selection bias (e.g., very busy HCWs might not have been willing to participate). In addition, due to the non-targeted recruitment, we are unable to calculate a response rate. Still, the 857 physicians participating in this study represent approximately 2.3% of all 37'882 licenced Swiss physicians in 2019. 46 This exceeds the per capita rate of participating HCWs of previous studies by far.
