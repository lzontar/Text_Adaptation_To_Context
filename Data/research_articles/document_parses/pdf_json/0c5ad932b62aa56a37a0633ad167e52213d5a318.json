Speaking about cardiac surgery units, the pandemic affects our daily routine in different ways: limited intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilation sites, necessity to postpone elective and/or complex cardiac surgeries, shortage of healthcare workers, sick healthcare staff and/or risk of infection of our Teams, risk of developing COVID-19 after cardiac surgery, and patients with COVID-19 needing urgent cardiac operations without having a properly organized operating room and ICU.",

On the other hand, some in-hospital patients might face the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2, with a possible fatal outcome during the perioperative period [4] : based on the central role of interleukin-6 and other pro-inflammatory mediators to cause tissue damage during the more severe COVID-19 cases, it's reasonable that during the postoperative period -normally characterized by a pro-inflammatory state -the patient who gets infected by SARS-CoV-2 would face an increased risk of severe COVID-19 [5] .",
