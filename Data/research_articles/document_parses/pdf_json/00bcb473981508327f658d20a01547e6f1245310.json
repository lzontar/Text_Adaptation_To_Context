This ensures that you will get enough poly(A)-containing RNA to perform several RT reactions using the same RNA preparation. 2. There are different Magnetic Particle Concentrators recommended, depending on the size of the tubes. To lyse the cells and bind the RNA to the oligo(dT) 25 magnetic beads, we use 15 mL tubes. Before we elute the poly(A)-containing RNA, we transfer the oligo(dT) 25 magnetic beads into a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube. 3. If the oligo(dT) 25 magnetic beads appear to clump and do not resuspend well, you have cellular DNA in your sample. However, you can proceed without affecting the RNA quality or yield, if you perform additional washing steps (2-4) until the oligo(dT) 25 magnetic beads can be resuspended easily. 4.

In both RNA preparations, it is possible to identify the HCoV 229E genomic RNA (27.3 kb) and the six subgenomic mRNAs (1.7 kb-6.8 kb) that are characteristic of Fig. 2 . Pulse-field gel electrophoresis of HCoV 229E RT-PCR products. Five microliters of each PCR reaction were separated by PFGE together with a 5-kbp DNA ladder and a highmolecular weight DNA marker (Life Technologies). Also shown are the cycle profiles that have been used to produce RT-PCR products ranging from 11.5-20.3 kbp in length. coronavirus infection. The hybridization analysis indicates that the material prepared using the oligo(dT) 25 magnetic beads (lane 2) is less degraded than the material prepared using poly(U)-Sepharose (lane 1). RT-PCR amplifications of more than 5 kbp were only possible when poly(A)-containing RNA shown in lane 2 was used as the template for reverse transcription. 5. The oligo(dT) 25 magnetic beads can be regenerated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal). However, during the repeated washing steps, you will loose about 20% of the magnetic beads. 6. Add the reagents in the order listed in Subheading 3.2. To melt RNA structures before the reverse transcription, some protocols recommend to heat the RNA for 10 min at 70\u00b0C. However, in most cases this is not necessary. 7. Because the RT is performed at 42\u00b0C, cDNAs can be generated during the RT reaction by \"less stringent\" priming events. This is the reason for most of the background PCR products observed in our system. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to use a highly specific RT-primer and to adjust the optimal primer concentration in the RT-reaction (6). Furthermore, we recommend the use of different primers for the RT and PCR reactions. 8. Before adding the SuperScript II enzyme, the RNA template and the RT-primer should be at 42\u00b0C to minimize unspecific binding. 9. We recommend incubation for 90 min when cDNA synthesis of more than 10 kb is desired.",

Some protocols for the amplification of long mRNAs have required digestion of the RNA with RNase H after cDNA synthesis (11). This step did not seem to be necessary for amplification with HCoV 229E genomic RNA. This may be owing to the fact that in our protocols the HCoV 229E RNA was relatively abundant. Experiments with dystrophin mRNA required treatment with RNase H prior to amplification (6). 11. The PCR cycle conditions have to be optimized according to the amount of template, the PCR primers and the cycle profile. We recommend that these parameters should be optimized with RT-PCRs of expected product sizes below 5 kbp before trying to synthesize longer RT-PCR products. 12. This will result in a Mg 2+ concentration of 2 mM. 13. Optional: a \"real\" hot start can be performed by adding the enzyme mix after the PCR sample has reached 94\u00b0C.",
