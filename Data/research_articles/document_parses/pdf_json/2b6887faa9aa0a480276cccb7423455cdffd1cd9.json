Rabies virus infection causes encephalomyelitis in humans with a nearly 100% case fatality rate. Current strategies of post-exposure prophylaxis treatment (PEP), for example after a dog bite, are highly effective and involve vaccination together with infiltration of the wound with anti-rabies immunoglobulins (RIG's). Each year tens of thousands of people, many children, succumb because of rabies and the societal cost worldwide is estimated to be in excess of US$ 6 billion including US$ 1.6 billion spent on post-exposure prophylaxis [1] .",

The rare survivors, often from infection with less virulent bat-derived lyssaviruses, have high titers of antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In fatal rabies cases only a minority of patients have antibodies in serum and none have neutralizing antibodies in the CSF [2] . This indicates that in survivors neutralizing antibodies reach the CSF and effectively halt and eliminate virus replication. Therefore, blocking rabies virus replication in the central nervous system (CNS) could be an effective treatment. The pathogenesis of rabies remains a subject of study. Adverse or detrimental host responses are expected to play a role as well. Successful treatment may require a combination of antivirals and inflammatory drugs.",

Ketamine showed some effect on rabies infection in animal studies while for amantadine efficacy in animals could not be demonstrated. A combination of ketamine and amantadine was explored in patients, together with other treatment interventions, in the so-called 'Milwaukee Protocol'.

Intracellular host enzymes convert favipiravir to its active form favipiravir-4-ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate (T-705-RTP). The mechanism of action of T-705-RTP remains a topic of discussion. It mimics a purine nucleotide analog that selectively inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or causes lethal mutagenesis upon incorporation into the viral RNA [6] . Favipiravir is currently approved for treatment against influenza in Japan, and is in clinical development the United States [5] . Recently Yamada et al. [7] showed that favipiravir also has antiviral activity against Rabies virus. In vivo experiments showed that it, under conditions of early start of treatment, improves the clinical signs and survival rate of mice infected intramuscularly. If the start of favipiravir treatment is delayed for 1 or 2 days no significant protective effect can be observed. This indicates that favipiravir might be ineffective against viruses located within the nervous systems and may be only effective before neuroinvasion.",

Biochemical studies revealed that ALS-008112-5 0 -triphosphate is a potent and selective inhibitor of RSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (K i of 0.09 mM), via a classic chain termination mechanism. In vitro experiments also show that ALS-008112 is active on Parainfluenza virus and Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The EC 50 on VSV was reported as 3.4 mM, which is 20-fold less active as on RSV but still with a good selectivity (CC 50 > 100 mM). No activity was detected on negative strand RNA viruses beyond the Paramyxoand Rhabdoviridae families, nor was activity noted against any of the tested positive strand RNA viruses [8] . As indicated above ALS-008176 is a prodrug that needs metabolisation to become active.

This RNP is the template for transcription and replication by the RdRp (L protein). Viral RNA synthesis is mediated by the viral Phospho-(P) protein, which is a multifunctional protein that interacts with L and N. The P-protein allows efficient and specific recognition of the RNP template by the RdRp and subsequent RNA polymerization.
