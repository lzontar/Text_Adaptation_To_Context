However, its availability is still limited to some selected states in our country (Singh 2013) . The present chapter focuses on the crucial attributes of B. bassiana that are responsible for its biocontrol activity. In addition, certain strain improvement techniques have also been taken under consideration that would augment the in situ action of the fungus. Besides, the heavy-metal remediation by B. bassiana has also been discussed. B. bassiana is the most appreciated endophytic fungal entomopathogen to date, with a widespread commercial availability as a potent mycopesticide. The fungus establishes itself as an endophyte either naturally, e.g., by stomatal penetration, or with the aid of inoculation methods such as soil drenches, seed coatings and immersions, radicle dressings, root and rhizome immersions, stem injection, and foliar and flower sprays. Hence, it is widely acknowledged as a success in a variety of plants such as grasses; agricultural crops, viz., tomato, cotton, corn, and potato; the medicinal group including opium poppy, cocoa, and coffee; and trees such as Carpinus caroliniana and western white pine (Vega et al. 2008; Ownley et al. 2008) . The most preferred protocol for endophytic colonization of B. bassiana includes the use of formulations augmented with solid inert carriers or diluents such as diatomaceous earth, talc, clay, vermiculite, corn cob grits, and alginate gels (Wagner and Lewis 2000; Parsa et al. 2013) . Irrespective of the multifarious inoculation techniques, the extent of colonization depends on the type of plant part evaluated, the inoculation method used, and the initial spore density on the plant tissue (Posada et al. 2007; Ownley et al. 2008) . While leaves respond best to foliar sprays, roots colonize only to drench inoculation with stems responding equally to both forms. A plausible yet untested hypothesis suggests that the extent of endophytic colonization correlates positively with the extent of endophyte-mediated resistance by the host. The insecticidal attribute of B. bassiana recommends its use in biopesticide industry with particular reference to the malaria-causing mosquito vector. The spores of B. bassiana have a high affinity for the female Anopheles mosquito. However, for proper infestation, spore sufficiency and direct contact with the insect is required so that the fungus can efficiently penetrate and germinate the insect cuticle. Female Anopheles stephensi, the causal agent of human malaria in Asia, relishes on the dead and dying caterpillars heavily infested with B. bassiana, thereby letting themselves be infested in turn with this fungus. George et al. (2013) premiered a caterpillar sans innovative technique of using oil-formulated dried spores sprayed on a cloth that resulted in the fungal infestation efficiency of 95 % in the mosquitoes.

Fungi are comparatively more tolerant to heavy-metal stress and thrive well in the acidified environment owing to their adaptation of several strategies of rendering the metal ions into innocuous forms. Hence, their use in bioremediation of industrial effluents and wastewaters containing heavy metals has been reported globally (Rajapaksha et al. 2004 ). The main principle for bioremediation is biosorption that primarily utilizes amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and carbonyl groups of the cell wall for metal binding as elucidated by FTIR analysis. A plethora of fungal species, such as Aspergillus niger, Mucor rouxii, Rhizopus spp., etc., have been reported to be utilized in heavy-metal remediation. Besides this, B. bassiana is reported to efficiently adsorb Cd and Pb from aqueous metal solutions. Physicochemical factors like solution pH and contact time at room temperature positively affected the rate of metal biosorption (Tomko et al. 2006) . Another strategy of heavy-metal uptake by fungal species involves immobilization followed by precipitation. Fungal metal leaching is promoted by proton efflux or metabolites with chelating properties. Metal immobilization can also occur through other processes of reductive metal precipitation such as synthesis of metallic nanoparticles that suggests its novel applications in the corrosion control of metal and stone artifacts. B. bassiana is reported to be endowed with the ability of heavy-metal chelation using oxalates as organic chelators. The beauverial oxalate reportedly chelates a variety of metals, involving iron (iron oxalates were directly sequestered on the fungal hyphae), copper (formation of characteristic \"Liesegang rings\" due to simultaneous diffusion and precipitation of copper oxalates), and silver (coprecipitation of copper and silver oxalates) (Joseph et al. 2012 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 572, "end": 595, "text": "(Rajapaksha et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1172, "end": 1191, "text": "(Tomko et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2066, "end": 2085, "text": "(Joseph et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Bioremediation of Heavy Metals: Potential Capacity of B. bassiana in the Biosorption of Heavy Metals"}, {"text": "B. bassiana produces a plethora of secondary metabolites having multifarious roles not only in pest control but in other human benefits too ( Fig. 10 .1).

However, these structural changes were not reported to be caused by hemolymph pigmentation with the simultaneous production of toxic quinones. The pigmentation activity was carried out by the enzyme prophenoloxidase, activated by bassiacridin.

Post synthesis, these domains catalyze the condensation of the monomers to form the octadepsipeptide with a 24-membered macrolactone ring. This structure further isomerizes to the final cyclic tetrameric ester form (Suzuki et al. 1977) . Comparative in vitro infection studies against selected insect host establish bassianolide as a highly significant virulence factor of B. bassiana, inducing atony to the larvae of H. zea and toxicity to silkworm larvae. Knockout mutants with a targeted disruption of bbBsls gene were unable to produce bassianolide and showed a drastic reduction in virulence against the model insects Galleria mellonella and H. zea.

Thus, bassianolide represents a bona fide virulence factor of the entomopathogen significantly contributing to the commercial biological insecticide preparation containing the spores of the fungus. Besides being a potent insecticide, purified bassianolide inhibits the acetylcholine-induced smooth muscle contraction, as well as displays in vitro cytotoxic, moderate antiplasmodial and antimycobacterial activities (Jirakkakul et al. 2008 ).

Fungal enzymes, particularly superoxide dismutases (SODs) capable of scavenging the ROS, establish their virulence and field persistence. SODs are superoxide species scavenging metalloproteins that offer the first line of defense against superoxide damage. The SODs function in cell response, cell differentiation and infection yielded the benefit of mycelial growth, ordered conidiation rhythm, and increased sporulation potential and timely conidial germination in fungi.

The ability to control conidiation and thermotolerance in insect pathogenic fungus as well as the ability to control the dissemination of genetically modified strains in field application has an important implication for the mass production of this biocontrol agent.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 847, "end": 865, "text": "(Fang et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of G-Protein Signaling (BbRGS1) in Conidiation and Conidial Thermotolerance of B. bassiana"}, {"text": "The entomopathogenic ability of B. bassiana has been extensively studied and advocated in insect pest management (Roberts and St Leger 2004; Wang et al. 2004; Thomas and Read 2007) . However, a major hindrance toward its commercialization and application is its slower action compared to chemical insecticides, which enables the infected insects to cause a serious damage to crops until controlled (St Leger et al. 1996) . To overcome such obstacles, there have been constant efforts for the improvement of the desired strains which render their quick action and high reproducibility. Various approaches have been employed to develop enhanced B. bassiana strains, including the recovery of mutants after UV-light irradiation (Hegedus and Khachatourians 1995; Meirelles et al. 1997) . Other reported methods involve genetic recombination (Viaud et al. 1998 ) and genetic constructs (Fan et al. 2007; Fang et al. 2005; Joshi et al. 1995; Sandhu et al. 2001) . Genetic engineering, involving the identification and manipulation of the virulent genes, has elevated the insecticidal efficacy and biocontrol potential of the fungus. The expression of a neurotoxin AAIT from the scorpion Androctonus australis and an insect cuticle-degrading protease PR1A from Metarhizium anisopliae has permitted a high efficiency of B. bassiana.
