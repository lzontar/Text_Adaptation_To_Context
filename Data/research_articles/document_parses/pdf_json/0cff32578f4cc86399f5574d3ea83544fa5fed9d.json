Fortunately, the majority of practical teaching was able to be completed prior to lockdown, except for Year 3 Medicine students who would have returned after the Easter vacation. The practical element of two, ongoing blended anatomy postgraduate courses was also suspended. At the same time, several surgical skills courses catering for c.100 delegates had to be cancelled. Postgraduate (PhD) student work on cadaveric material also ceased. All anatomy staff commenced working from home by 20 March, and the anatomy building closed to all but essential staff, which comprised two licensed teachers and two technicians. The extensive collection of prosected cadaveric material and freezer content was monitored weekly. As the building is shared by the University and the National Health Service (NHS), it was immediately opened for essential training which was coordinated by staff in the Clinical Skills Centre. To date, no requests have been forthcoming for assistance with mortuary facilities. The Anatomy team donated all basic Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to the NHS.

Three weeks of anatomy teaching remained for most students, who comprised c.900 undergraduate and postgraduate students in anatomical sciences, forensic anthropology, medicine, dentistry, oral health sciences, and medical and forensic art. Medical students are taught for a longer period, with classes for Year 3 students continuing well into May. However, there was no more dissection in that period, with only some anatomy revision sessions remaining. MSc students carrying out practical projects on Thiel embalmed bodies either completed data collection swiftly before university closure, or moved to literature projects instead. PhD students using Thiel specimens had to suspend data collection for the foreseeable future. All external activities, including surgical skills courses, research projects, service work with medical device companies, and any other events utilising Thiel bodies were suspended. While most staff members commenced working from home on 19 March, technical staff continued to enter the building for essential maintenance, and both technical and administrative staff were permitted to go into work to prepare bodies for cremation. The local Dundee COVID-19 response teams requested provision of the following: (a) access to dissecting rooms for body storage if the local mortuaries were stretched beyond capacity; (b) assistance from technical staff to ease anticipated pressure on pathologists and technicians at the local police mortuary, where Anatomy staff had already undergone induction, as well as the mortuary at the local teaching hospital; (c) loan of the Anatomy van, which has the capacity to transport six bodies at a time; and (d) provision of any excess PPE as part of a Dundee-wide initiative.",

The summer term at the LMU started on 20 April with online teaching. The university acquired a one-year campus licence from the commercial provider Zoom for all academic staff and this was used for preclinical teaching. Due to reported security problems, Zoom was only used when no personalised data (i.e. patient data) were transmitted during teaching. For sensitive meetings, a different system, dfnconf, was utilised. All medical students, especially those who have passed their first major examination (M1 or Physikum), were asked to apply for a part-time contract of 19 hours a week at the university hospitals, which are expected to see high numbers of COVID-19 patients. These students were provided with an adapted curriculum adjusted to their clinical duties. ",

The longer-term impact of the pandemic on anatomy teaching will depend largely on when the University reopens. There is optimism for a return to the 'new normal' by the start of the academic year in October 2020, but if the situation extends beyond this, the level of disruption will be considerable. If the University does not reopen fully by then, considerable reorganisation of the medical curriculum will be required. Significant resources have already been devoted to developing online teaching, which migrated from a 'Weblearn' system to a new 'Canvas' application. The way in which online teaching might best be developed is currently being investigated within a broad framework offering a variety of learning resources, including Instant Anatomy and Acland's Anatomy as well as an extensive set of in-house notes, diagrams and videos to cover the curriculum. Intensive pre-professional examination preparation courses held in the evening for regional surgical trainees were suspended.",

These syllabi provide a useful standardised framework for anatomy educators to design and assess the content of courses, whether delivered face-to-face or online, albeit with efforts to validate their potential application and usefulness currently ongoing . What remains unclear is the extent to which online replacement of anatomy teaching, or the uptake of blended learning models (combining on campus with online approaches), will leave unavoidable gaps in core content, knowledge and practical application. This issue will need to be investigated in significant detail over the coming months and years, together with the longer-term impact on student knowledge and professional capabilities. Whilst the move to online teaching is going to affect all subjects to a greater or lesser degree, the loss of hands-on practical teaching using cadaveric material is of particular importance and relevance for the study of Anatomy. Early, largely anecdotal, experience suggests that the online resources and opportunities being made available at short notice are not capable of replacing the face-to-face, practical-based experience of an anatomy teaching laboratory. It will, therefore, be important to address how students that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can replace or substitute these activities in the future, taking into consideration their own concerns and views. Such factors may also influence the decision-making process for students considering applying for enrolment on courses with an anatomical component over the coming years.",

Such activities, with associated benefits concerning student engagement, cannot be replaced or substituted for by virtual/online methods alone. Moreover, considerations regarding the value of working with cadaveric specimens in terms of developing necessary professionalism and manual dexterity need to be considered, when students are missing the opportunity to have a platform for developing and practising empathy, hand and teamwork skills, as well as an appropriate professional attitude. The cancellation of practical-based examinations is also a concern. When such methods of assessment have been largely removed, with no detriment to student progression in many cases, it is important to try to assess students' practical skills and knowledge using other robust methodologies. In the long term, therefore, reinstatement of practical-based anatomy examinations will be one of the most important elements of resuming 'normality' once the pandemic is over. This situation is likely to be particularly pertinent with regards to surgical trainees, since Royal College Membership is required for entry into specialist training, but at present, the Royal Colleges have suspended their MRCS Part B examinations (which by definition contain a substantial anatomy component) until further notice. This raises significant concerns in terms of the progression of trainees to surgical training with inherent workforce planning implications for the delivery of front-line medical care. Taken together, it is clear that the short-and medium-term consequences of COVID-19 disruption for the assessment of anatomical knowledge and skills will need to be addressed by targeted, quantitative research studies over the coming months and years.",

There will need to be national/ international guidance on the requirements to add coronavirus to other existing risk factors (e.g. prion/BSE, HIV and TB) as potential post-mortem risks for both staff and students. Given that a number of institutions rely on imported anatomical material to meet demand, the development of an internationally recognised framework and reporting procedure (as well as best practice guidelines) will be important. Moreover, the resumption of bequeathal programmes will be important in order to meet demand for anatomy training over the coming years. Many universities and medical schools continue to receive several enquiries a day from donors and/or their relatives, despite the closure of body donation programmes. Fortunately, most potential donors do appear to understand that the cessation is temporary. Nevertheless, there is likely to be a decrease in donor acceptance rates due to COVID-19 as a cause of death and the increased mortality during this period, which may result in a decreased death rate among the donor base in future years. Therefore, when the pandemic is over, raising public awareness of the continuing need for donors for Anatomical Examination may be necessary. It should be noted that some elderly potential donors have been distressed at the thought they will not be able to complete their lifelong intention to donate their body for Anatomical Examination. Anatomists, as a community, must not forget what an important decision this is, both for them and their families.",

Year 3 students were scheduled to undertake the intensive Principles of Clinical Anatomy course in June, during which they would have daily sessions in the dissecting room revising all aspects of anatomy before proceeding to clinical school. While this course remains under review dependent on further Government directives, extensive preparations were being made to deliver the teaching online if necessary. Graduate Entry Medicine and Biomedical Science students were also significantly affected. Final year medical students graduated early so that they could start helping on the NHS front-line. The body donation programme was suspended and locked down, with a small number of technical staff permitted to access the building regularly for monitoring of the current donors. The Nuffield Department of Surgery training course was cancelled, during which experienced surgeons would come for an intensive week to undertake cadaveric procedures in their specialty, an invaluable resource for junior surgical trainees. 2.10 | Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) An Irish Government directive required the closure of all schools and universities from 12 March. As a result, all campus-based anatomy teaching ceased for 375 Year 1 medical and physiotherapy students and 15 postgraduate Physician Associate students, who had 4 weeks of teaching term still to run.

Due to the submersion of bodies in a Thiel tank for six months, the risk from COVID-19 was considered to be relatively low, except at the time of embalming. However, on 16 March, HMIAS, after consultation with all the anatomy centres in Scotland and to ensure a consistent approach across the country, suspended all acceptance of body donations until further notice. The Inspector also proposed extending the law compelling cremation or burial of donors within 3 years of their date of death. As this required passing through the Scottish Parliament, the provision was heard and approved as part of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Bill on 1 April. Information on COVID-19 and the risks associated with the deceased was sparse, except for the Royal College of Pathologists' guidance for mortuary staff dealing with COVID-19 bodies (Royal College of Pathologists, 2020; Royal College of Surgeons, 2020). Subsequently, the International Committee of the Red Cross published general guidance on the management of the deceased with COVID-19",

On 16 March, official advice was issued from the Scottish Government to suspend all donor-related activities, including cremations, which was immediately actioned in Glasgow. No information was immediately available concerning the response of donors and relatives regarding suspension of the donor programme.

The Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College London (ICL) was placed in lockdown on 20March, which was the last day of the Spring Term. ICL should have sufficient donors for teaching in the academic year 2020-21, but was unable to release donors for funerals. Although the Human Anatomy Unit was in lockdown, several members of staff, as designated key workers, were permitted access to the facilities to ensure that donor material was maintained in accordance with the provisions of the UK Human Tissue Act(2004).",

The two Gastrointestinal and Renal system modules, which are taught to 185 medical students, were affected by the crisis. These are normally delivered in the last six weeks of the second semester and are taught as integrated systems-based modules with lectures from Anatomy, Physiology and Biochemistry as well as clinical disciplines. They would also include laboratory sessions in Anatomy and Physiology. While 60% of the Gastrointestinal System Anatomy practical components had been completed, the Renal System practical classes could not be held. Three BSc modules comprising 40 students were also affected. For these students, half of the laboratory component for the Gastrointestinal System module could not be completed, as well as half of the Head and Neck module. One Gross Anatomy demonstration session was cancelled for the 24 students taking the second year Podiatry module. Commercial Biomedical Device Gross Anatomy teaching was suspended, as were the remaining Gross Anatomy sessions for the 19 students enrolled on the MSc/ Postgraduate Diploma in multidisciplinary Radiology. All teaching was delivered online, generally via VLE Blackboard using Blackboard Collaborate Ultra tool and Audio enhanced Lecture material delivered via Audio PowerPoint or MP4 files. Students were also supported via a host of e-learning materials: Acland's Video Atlas of Anatomy, Visible Body Atlas of Human Anatomy, OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology, Complete Anatomy, Anatomus, BioDigital Human, BioDigital Studio and IMAIOS. All first year examinations for medical students in the second semester were conducted online in MCQ format, with cadaveric images from donors who had provided consent. In addition, Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins made many of their anatomy texts and resources freely available for use during the crisis.",
