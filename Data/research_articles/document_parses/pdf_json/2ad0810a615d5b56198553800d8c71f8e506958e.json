PLA is the most widely used polymer in Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technology. PLA is a recyclable, biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastic; and it is obtained from corn and sugar cane. The low thermal expansion coefficient of PLA facilitates its printing. Therefore, PLA printed parts show high precision and surface quality [3] . Additionally, toxicity levels associated with PLA filaments during 3D printing are lower than those derived from fossil fuels, like (ABS) [7] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 Nevertheless, there are two critical parameters when surgical devices are manufacturing by 3D printing: the porosity and the surface roughness. Surgical instruments require a smooth surface to avoid that it can damage tissues or wear away the tool over time, to limit the risk of bacterial contamination and to guarantee a high corrosion resistance. Nowadays, the use of 3D printing technology is limited in the surgical field because this technology produces rough tools, so after the initial manufacturing process it is necessary to apply additional processes such as electro-chemical machining (ECM), thermal deburring or electro-polishing, for improving the initial surface finish. These processes are critical for 3D printing devices; compromising its mechanical properties [8, 9] .",

Unlike more traditional methods, the application of coatings by atmospheric pressure plasma polymerization does not require working under vacuum conditions or using solvents; so it is cheap, versatile, clean and the properties of the coatings could be modified by controlling different processing parameters (e.g., passes, power, speed, etc.). Besides, cold plasma treatments are suitable for PLA filaments because the low temperature that is reached during these treatments does not cause damage to heat sensible biomaterials [23] . Many researches have applied atmospheric plasma coatings to reduce bacterial attachment. Stallard et al [24] quantified the protein adsorption and bacterial adhesion onto silicon and titanium substrates previously modified by atmospheric pressure plasma polymerized siloxane coatings. Fluorinated siloxane coatings increased the hydrophobic wetting behavior and produced a significant reduction of Staphylococcus aureus attachment and protein adsorption. Hern\u00e1ndez-Orta et al [25] evaluated the bactericidal capacity of atmospheric pressure plasma polymerized 4-vinyl pyridine (4VP) coatings on high-density polyethylene substrates. The 4VP coatings achieved a complete E. coli inactivation. Further explanation of these studies is carried out in a previous work [26] , in which we reviewed different mechanisms that employ atmospheric pressure plasma technologies for the deposition of antibiofilm coatings. Among these antibiofilm approaches, coatings that modify the physicochemical surface properties stand out. In food industry, the modification of physicochemical substrate properties can be a good prospect compared with the disadvantages that may arise with other alternatives, such as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 coatings containing antibacterial and biocidal agents. The coatings that produce a change in the surface properties can decrease biofilm formation avoiding the bacterial adhesion rather than killing them once attached. Besides, this approach does not use biocidal agents, so it gives places to non-toxic surfaces with antibiofilm capacity; which is ideal for food contact surfaces. Functional groups added in the substrate by the fragmentation of the precursor molecules, form a layer of water that generates a steric repulsion and prevent direct contact between bacteria and substrates. However, antibiofilm mechanism is not yet totally understood. In a recent work [27] , we applied acrylic acid (AcAc) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) plasma-polymerization coatings over 3D printed polylactic-acid (PLA) Petri dishes with the aim of reducing P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes biofilms, three important species in the food industry. AcAc coatings incremented the amount of oxygen functional groups and PLA wettability; and therefore, reduced biofilm formation.",

            "text": "P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are two of the most significant opportunistic pathogens in the clinical field and are capable of causing a broad range of infections. P. aeruginosa is responsible of important nosocomial infections, can cause infections normally associated with hospital instruments where the bacteria adheres and adapts (including catheters, stethoscopes, drainage implants...) and causes serious infections in patients who have cronical respiratory issues or immunosuppression [28] . S. aureus causes a range of recalcitrant device-related infections, such as intravascular catheter infections, prosthetic joint and valve infections, etc. [29] . The aim of this work was to reduce the microbial adhesion and contamination of PLA 3D printed tools by applying antibiofilm plasma-polymerized coatings using an atmosphericpressure plasma jet (APPJ) system. Over the last years, numerous studies have described the benefits of using 3D printed instruments in surgical operations but have warned about the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 9 risks associated with the contamination of 3D printed surfaces. Hsu et al [30] evaluated the advantages of employing 3D printing surgical splints and templates during maxillofacial surgery. The 3D printed surgical devices increased the accuracy in repositioning the chin segment. Mardini et al [31] employed 3D printed positioning instruments (manufactured by stereolithography) to guide the location of osteotomies and the fixation of bone segments. It allowed a more precise and rapid reconstruction. Anton de Vez et al [32] used a 3D printed PLA surgical guide during a rhinoplasty. They observed that 3D printing technology incremented the accuracy; making the intervention easier and faster than the conventional osteotomy. Chuan et al [33] designed a 3D printed ABS armband coated with a gelatinous substance used to attach the armband to the patient's burnt skin. This research stablished that 3D printing technology is useful for replacing the current bandages, and consequently, for reducing patients' pain and promoting healing. However, they warned that the material for medical applications should be sterilized easily, so we have to choose them carefully.",

The characteristic superficial pattern of FFF printing, with grooves due to the deposition of fused filament, is showed (Fig. 3[c] ). The impossibility of setting up a water drop on those grooves involved that the wettability (water contact angle, WCA) of the plate surfaces was not measured. The SEM images magnification, increasing from x100 to x2000, provided a more detailed view of the PLA surface. The lumpy surface shows many spaces and holes where bacteria could attach and proliferate ( Fig. 3[b,d] ). Plasma-polymerized particles could easily approach and deposit on higher surface points (hills). Then, these particles could either stick to such points or bounce off. Nonsticking particles were re-emitted and could arrive at lower surface points (valleys). This phenomenon leads to the generation of rougher surfaces [41] .",

The most complex and textured surface was obtained when one AcAc pass was applied (Sdr: 8.6\u00b11.61%, Fig. 5 ). As a greater number of passes were applied, the AcAc coating was filling the surface grooves, so the surface irregularities decreased (Sdr: 2.62\u00b10.09%, Fig. 5 ). However, the highest surface roughness was obtained when two passes were applied (Ra: 531.5\u00b131.58 nm, Fig. 5 ). Most spaces were filled and disappeared after applying 6 passes (Fig. 4[c,d]) , which leds to a smoother surface and a lower roughness.

They observed the magnification effect of surface roughness in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f hierarchical structures. The water contact angle greatly decreased when increasing surface roughness if the surface was originally hydrophilic. This increase in the hydrophilic character reduced the bacterial adhesion, which was attributed to the formation of a tightly bound water layer adjacent to the film interface that brought repulsive forces between the bacteria and the gel films. Yuan et al. [46] , applied an air plasma treatment over smooth and fibrous polystyrene (PS) films.

As the chemical characterization suggested, the plasmapolymerized coatings may have increased the hydrophilic character of the samples by providing their surface chemistry with polar groups, which would promote surface hydration and consequently, a repulsive force ( Fig. 8[a,c] ). In addition, the reduction of the number of plasma-polymerization passes caused an increase in the surface roughness. Such roughening effect could magnify the hydrophilicity of the coatings and hence, the repulsive forces that would hinder bacterial adhesion (Fig. 8 [c-f]). This seems evident for the interaction of the coatings with S. aureus strains, which showed the highest and lowest biofilm productions on the coatings with the lowest and the highest roughness values, respectively (with the exception of S. aureus ATCC29213).",

            "text": "The different behavior of P. aeruginosa strains on sample Ac1p can be explained by the size and shape of these bacteria and the profiles of the plates [47] . As other authors have defined, the rough patterns are propitious to reduce bacterial attatchment and, consequently, biofilm production. In contrast, the biofilm formation is favored by smooth surfaces, where the bacteria tend to accumulate in large groups. In particular, when the distance between peaks is lower than the bacterial size, they undergo structural modifications that hinder the superficial adhesion [48] . They might even cause an elongation of the cell membrane, its subsequent rupture and, consequently, the cell death [49] . P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative and rodshaped (0.5-1 \u00b5m width and 2-4 \u00b5m length) bacterium, while S. aureus is a Gram-positive and round-shaped (0.5-1 \u00b5m diameter) bacterium [48] . Ac1p is the coating which presents the lowest distance between peaks and the maximum Sdr value (1.22\u00b10.84 \u00b5m and 8.6\u00b11.61%, respectively). These spaces between peaks are 2-3 times lower than P. aeruginosa length ( Fig.   8 [b]) and could reduce their adhesion for any of the aforementioned reasons. For these reasons, Ac1p coating resulted in the lowest biofilm production by P. aeruginosa strains. On the other hand, the length of S. aureus bacteria (Fig. 8 [c-f]) is lower than the space between peaks of any of the AcAc coatings in the present study. So, for these strains, the distance between peaks had no effect on the biofilm production.",

The medium was removed at the end of the incubation period, and the biofilm was washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and fixed with methanol during 15 minutes at room temperature. Plates were dried during 10 minutes at room temperature after removing the methanol. Then, 3 mL of CV solution was added (Sigma, final concentration 10% in PBS) and incubated at room temperature during 20 minutes. The CV excess was removed under running water and dried.Finally, the cell bound crystal violet was dissolved in 3 mL of acetic acid 66% v/v, incubated at room temperature for 1 h and quantified by absorbance at 590 nm. Measures were performed on a plate reader (POLAR star Omega microplate reader, BMG Labtech). Three PLA Petri dishes with no treatment were included as control in all assays. Four PLA Petri dishes were used per each treatment and microorganism. ANOVA test has been realized to",
