Maximum material removal (MR) has been obtained at processing time (60 min) and higher surface rotational speed (300 RPM). It may be hypothesized that as surface rotational speed is increased, there will be more surface abrasion. On the other hand, material removal is continuously increased with increase in processing time upto 60 minutes. After 60 minutes of processing time, most of the surface asperities have been removed. So material removal starts decreasing. Figure 4 shows combined effect of processing time and chemical concentration on material removal (MR). Initially MR is increased by increasing the chemical concentration and processing time. But after processing for 45 minutes with maximum chemical concentration (700 gms/lt) material removal start decreasing. Further, material removal keeps on increasing with increase in processing time but decrease in chemical concentration of etchant. Maximum material removal is achieved at maximum processing time (75 min) and minimum chemical concentration (500 gm/lt).It may be hypothesized that effect of chemical concentration is limited upto certain processing time. Figure 5 shows the combined effect of surface rotational speed and chemical concentration on material removal (MR). It can be observed that MR is increased by simultaneous increment in surface rotational speed and chemical concentration of etchant. Maximum material removal (MR) is obtained at maximum chemical concentration (700 gm/lt) and surface rotational speed (300 RPM). It may be due to the fact that at maximum chemical concentration (700 gm/lt), surface molecular bonds become very loose. On other hand, as surface rotational speed is increased, more surface abrasion occurs resulting more material removed from workpiece. It is interesting to observe that maximum material is removed with medium Wt % of abrasive particles (35 %) and maximum surface rotational speed (300 rpm). As Wt %age of abrasives is further increased, material removal (MR) decreases drastically. Material removal is minimum at highest value of Wt %age of abrasives (45%) and at minimum surface rotational speed (60 rpm).

Figure 9 (b) shows that more material has been removed from work surfaces. Chemically diffused surfaces have been efficiently improved by removing most of surface irregularities at maximum speed (300 RPM).
