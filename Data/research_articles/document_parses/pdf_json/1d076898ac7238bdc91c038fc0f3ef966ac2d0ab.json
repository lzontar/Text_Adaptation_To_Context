In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this behavior may inadvertently lead to further spread of hospital acquired (nosocomial) infections and overload the healthcare system. For example, intensive care physicians report an influx of patients who can better contact their GP (8, 9) . The pressure to test can also lead to higher numbers of false positives. Which further fuels the pandemic anxiety unnecessarily (10) . 30 years of research show a clear link between psychological stress and the human immune system (11) . It is well understood that chronic stress is a major modulator of immunity and thus directly influences probability of infection (12) . For example, colleagues recently found a link between depression and the immune responses measured in the blood after a covid-19 infection (13) . It is therefore plausible that populations under stress have a lower resistance, which can be a breeding ground for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (stress as a virus niche).",

The results can be used to understand to what extend anxiety in the population can put a stress on the healthcare system. Also to become more critical as to what are possible sources of anxiety. Given the already high societal cost to prevent covid-19 related hospitalisations and deaths, it is crucial to address whether anxiety worsens the situation or not. Latest data from France and Belgium indicate that when the epidemic wave subsides, anxiety also decreases (21, 22) . The anxiety curve seems to follow the epidemic curve quite well.",

Thirdly, by the nature of the current epidemic, we will likely include many preliminary research findings through preprint, which lessens the robustness of findings.

As studies represent data at the population level, it will not be valid to make statements about the individual chances of people being hospitalized or dying from anxiety. Fifth, precision of findings is likely to be limited as countries register hospitalizations and deaths related to Covid-19 in different ways.
