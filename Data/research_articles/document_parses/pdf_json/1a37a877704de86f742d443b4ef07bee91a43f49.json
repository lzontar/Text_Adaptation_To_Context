            "text": "Mortality due to Covid-19 is highly associated with advanced age, owing in large part to severe lower respiratory tract infection. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the host ACE2 receptor for infection. Whether ACE2 abundance in the lung contributes to age-associated vulnerability is currently unknown. We set out to characterize the RNA and protein expression profiles of ACE2 in aging human lung in the context of phenotypic parameters likely to affect lung physiology. Examining publicly available RNA sequencing data, we discovered that mechanical ventilation is a critical variable affecting lung ACE2 levels. Therefore, we investigated ACE2 protein abundance in patients either requiring mechanical ventilation or spontaneously breathing. ACE2 distribution and expression were determined in archival lung samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tissues were selected from the specimen inventory at a large teaching hospital collected between 2010-2020. Twelve samples were chosen from patients receiving mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF). Twenty samples were selected from patients not requiring ventilation. We compared samples across age, ranging from 40-83 years old in the ventilated cohort and 14-80 years old in the non-ventilated cohort. Within the alveolated parenchyma, ACE2 expression is predominantly observed in type II pneumocytes (or alveolar type II / AT2 cells) and alveolar macrophages. All 12 samples from our ventilated cohort showed histologic features of diffuse alveolar damage including reactive, proliferating AT2 cells. In these cases, ACE2 was strongly upregulated with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.004) or cellularity (p = 0.003), associated with prominent expression in AT2 cells. In non-ventilated individuals, AT2 cell reactive changes were not observed and ACE2 expression did not change with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.231) or cellularity (p = 0.349). Additionally, we observed prominent pulmonary endothelial ACE2 expression in 2 patients on either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). In summary, ACE2 expression increases with age in the setting of alveolar damage observed in patients on mechanical ventilation, providing a potential mechanism for higher Covid-19 mortality in the elderly.",

ACE2 is a transmembrane metalloprotease belonging to the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) which processes angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7 leading to vasodilation 24 . The gene encoding ACE2 (Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2, Ace2) exhibits strong RNA expression in the kidney, lung, bladder, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and adipose tissue of rodents 25 . In rats, lung ACE2 protein expression has been shown to drastically decrease with age 26 , raising the question of why older individuals are more susceptible to severe lower respiratory infection than the young 27 . Previous studies of ACE2 levels in the human lung have revealed no significant change with respect to age in bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis 28,29 . Similar findings have been observed in single cell RNA (scRNA) expression data for Ace2 in rodents 29 . In order to investigate this apparent paradox, we reexamined publicly available ACE2 RNAseq data from human lungs 30 , adjusting for various donor phenotypes. Our analyses reveal a significant increase in detected ACE2 RNA levels associated with mechanical ventilation. After including the effect of mechanical ventilation, we find that ACE2 expression increases with age in human lung samples from deceased donors. Although RNA levels often correlate with protein expression, exceptions are common 31,32 . We sought to validate our findings at the RNA level by investigating ACE2 protein expression in archival human lung tissue from patients receiving supportive mechanical ventilation. Consistently, ACE2 protein expression strongly increased with age in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. These findings, at both the RNA and protein level, provide a potential explanation for the preponderance of severe Covid-19 cases among the elderly.",

GTEx version 8 contains data from 578 unique deceased donor lungs, binned by decade of age at death 33 . In unadjusted analysis, ACE2 expression was not significantly associated with age (\u03b2 = 0.082 TPM/decade, p = 0.227, linear regression) or sex (p = 0.303, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) ( Figure 1A and 1B) . The dataset also describes the mode of death, summarized by the Hardy scale 36 , which categorizes clinical circumstances proximate to the end of life. The strongest category associated with ACE2 expression was ventilation at the time of death showing a 103% increase in median ACE2 levels (0.715 TPM without vs. 1.452 TPM with ventilation, p < 1x10 -15 , Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Lung ACE2 expression, when stratified by Hardy score, revealed a significant relationship with age; expression of ACE2 increased by 0.208 TPM for every decade of life (p = 0.003, multivariable regression), or a 14% increase each decade when compared to individuals in their 20's ( Figure 1C ). Transcript abundance from deceased donors can be affected by the tissue ischemic time that transpires prior to sample stabilization 37 . In order to assess whether this variable contributes to ACE2 abundance from deceased donor lungs, we incorporated this feature as a covariate in our model (Suppl. Figure 3 ). The contribution of tissue ischemic time to ACE2 expression was not significant (\u03b2 = -0.0003 TPM/minute, p = 0.248) and did not change the effect of age on ACE2 expression or its significance (\u03b2 = 0.212 TPM/decade, p = 0.002). We also compared ACE2 expression across the human body. Interestingly, when controlling for the manner of death, the lung exhibited the most significant increase in ACE2 expression with age over all tissues (Suppl . Table 1) .",

Our ACE2 IHC staining on healthy control tissue revealed a strikingly similar pattern, which highlighted the kidney cortex and specifically the apical membrane of brush border cells ( Figure 2A) . We also detected strong ACE2 expression along villi and the apical membranes of small intestine enterocytes ( Figure 2B ). Within the lung, ACE2 has been shown to localize to epithelial cells of the alveolus 38 . Data from murine scRNAseq reveal detectable expression of Ace2 within type II pneumocytes (or alveolar type II / AT2 cells), ciliated columnar cells, alveolar macrophages, and to a lesser extent, stromal cells (Suppl. Figure 4) . Consistent with these data, our IHC revealed strong ACE2 staining within AT2 cells in normal alveoli, concentrated within the membrane, as well as alveolar macrophages ( Figure 2C ). Taken together, these data indicate that our staining protocol accurately identifies ACE2 expressing cells within human tissue, including the lung. Therefore, we investigated whether the distribution of ACE2 in the lung is associated with ventilation and age.",

All tissue was collected prior to 2019 (range 2010 -2018), excluding the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 involvement. H&E control sections revealed the expected histologic findings, depending on the phase of DAD, with reactive AT2 hyperplasia, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial thickening and/or fibrosis, and exudative edema (Suppl. Figure 1B) . When stained by IHC, prominent ACE2 expression within the alveolar parenchyma was observed in reactive AT2 cells with increasing ACE2 staining intensity detected with advanced age ( Figure 3A and 3B). ACE2 expression was quantified either by normalizing to tissue area ( Figure 3C ) or cellularity ( Figure 3D ) which revealed a significant increase with age (p = 0.004 and p = 0.003, respectively, linear regression). As a control for precision, 1 of the 11 patients had a double lung explant with 2 samples collected contemporaneously (1 from the left lung and 1 from the right lung). In this 67 year-old-man, the pathological findings were the same for each sample (Suppl. Table2). Importantly, both specimens yielded similar results when quantified for ACE2, indicating that our procedure measured its expression with good intra-individual reproducibility ( Figure 3C and 3D). Excluding either of these samples did not change the effect of age on ACE2 expression (p = 0.009 by area and p = 0.003 by cellularity excluding the right lung; p = 0.008 by area and p = 0.006 by cellularity excluding the left lung, linear regression).",

Within the mammalian body, expression of ACE2, along with transmembrane serineprotease 2 (TMPRSS2)--the human protease responsible for activating the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein--coincides with cell types involved by Covid-19 39 . ACE2 protein is highly expressed in differentiated gut enterocytes, leading to productive infection with SARS-CoV-2 40 . Interestingly, ACE2 expression is upregulated in the airway and lungs of smokers 29 , a potential risk factor for severe disease 41 . Additionally, children have lower ACE2 RNA expression in their nasal epithelium compared with adults 42 . A growing body of evidence suggests that ACE2 is highly associated with disease susceptibility and severity. Given that the mechanism of death in Covid-19 typically involves severe lower respiratory tract infection, a disease feature strongly correlated with age, previous studies have sought to connect lung ACE2 expression with aging 28, 29 . Although we analyzed a subset of the same publicly available data, we highlight the critical impact of mechanical ventilation on ACE2 expression, an important physiologic change for the lung. By incorporating this feature into our model, we find that ACE2 expression indeed increases in older individuals through what is likely a combination of advanced age, and either the need for or consequence of mechanical ventilation.",

Patients in our ventilator supported cohort uniformly exhibited DAD with abundant hypertrophic AT2 cells. Our IHC analyses reveal that AT2 cells, as well as alveolar macrophages, are the primary cell types expressing ACE2 in the alveolus. Although we cannot rule out a subtle shift, changes in ACE2 expression among alveolar macrophages was minor when compared visually to AT2 cells and the former's abundance showed no relationship with age in ventilated patients. Rather, the age-related increase in ACE2 expression we observed appears to be primarily mediated by the level of this protein's expression in individual AT2 cells, with a potential lower contribution from other cells types. This trend was not seen in spontaneous breathing patients suggesting that the response of AT2 cells to alveolar injury drives this change. ACE2 expression in AT2 cells has been shown to dramatically decrease upon cell cycle entry 47 . Furthermore, a recent study has revealed that ACE2 expression is upregulated in human respiratory cells in response to inflammatory signals including IFN\u03b12 and IFN\u03b3 39 . Immune changes associated with aging include the chronic, low-grade endogenous production of inflammatory cytokines, frequently referred to as \"inflammaging\", which is caused by a number of processes [48] [49] [50] [51] . One potential model for the age-related differences we observe would be that in response to alveolar damage, AT2 cells enter the cell cycle and ordinarily downregulate ACE2 expression. However, in older individuals, the increase in circulating inflammatory cytokines prevents this downregulation or even leads to ACE2 upregulation alongside AT2 cell proliferation. Alternatively, epigenetic dysregulation may preclude the proper downregulation of ACE2 in aged AT2 cells 22 . This model implies that the relationship of aging to ACE2 expression is associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (i.e., the alveolar damage itself) instead of being caused by it. However, the reverse scenario also merits consideration.",

The pathological features of VILI are indistinguishable from other causes of ARDS and are induced by volume and pressure stress within the alveolus 53 . Ventilation strategies that result in VILI provoke higher levels of inflammatory cytokine release 54, 55 . In animal models, advanced age is associated with an increased likelihood of VILI 56 and exacerbated cytokine release in response to ventilation 57 . If lung ACE2 expression is triggered by mechanical ventilation itself via inflammatory cytokine production, then these factors may predispose older individuals to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The relative contributions of these and other potential mechanisms remain to be explored.",

The remaining 29 cases were taken from patients not receiving either class of medication.

A) Human lung ACE2 expression is colored by decade of life when the individual died. In unadjusted linear regression, there was no significant effect of age on ACE2 expression (p = 0.227, n = 578 individuals). B) ACE2 expression in lung stratified by sex. Analysis adjusted for age and sex, revealed no significant effect for either variable (p = 0.228 for age, p = 0.920 for sex, multivariate regression, n = 395 males, n = 183 females). There was also no significant difference when compared by sex alone (p = 0.303, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). C) ACE2 expression in lung stratified by the Hardy scale. This scale indicates the length of time spent in the terminal phase before death, which is depicted above each grouping of data points. Within each Hardy scale group, the data are sub-stratified by age. (n = 26 for a score of 1 representing a violent and fast death lasting <10 minutes, n = 156 for a score of 2 representing a fast death by natural causes lasting 10 minutes -1 hour, n = 31 for a score of 3 representing an intermediate rate of death lasting 1 hour -24 hours, n = 64 for a score of 4 representing a slow death with a terminal phase lasting > 24 hours, n = 299 for a score of 0 representing donors supported by a ventilator preceding death, n = 2 with an unknown score). For all panels, each point represents a sample from a unique individual. Box plots indicate quartiles. A linear model fit to the data is inset, indicating the estimated coefficient for age (\u03b21) and its significance. Quantitative IHC for ACE2 was carried out on samples from ventilated patients (n = 12 samples from 11 patients). Total ACE2 expression from 5 low power fields is plotted relative to the patient's age at the time of specimen collection. A linear fit to the data is indicated by the dashed line with the 95% confidence interval highlighted in grey. D) The same specimens quantitated in (C) were normalized by cellularity and the average ACE2 expression per cell is plotted along with a linear fit to the data and its 95% confidence interval. The red arrow in (C) and (D) indicates a patient providing 1 sample from the left lung and 1 sample from the right lung during the same procedure, utilized as a control for intraindividual reproducibility. Sections were stained for ACE2 using DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin. Figure 4 . ACE2 protein expression does not change with age in non-ventilated patients. A) Representative images of lung stained for ACE2 from a 77-year-old man undergoing wedge resection for suspected metastatic angiosarcoma are shown at low power (left, scale bar 200\u00b5m) and high power (right, scale bar 50\u00b5m). The normal alveolated lung parenchyma adjacent to the lesion reveals AT2 cells which are positive for ACE2 (red arrowheads) scattered among largely ACE2 low type I pneumocytes. B) Representative images of lung stained for ACE2 from a 26-year-old female who underwent blebectomy for a spontaneous pneumothorax are shown at low power (left, scale bar 200\u00b5m) and high power (right, scale bar 50\u00b5m). Histologic findings were similar to those found in (A) with strong ACE2 staining in scattered AT2 cells (red arrowheads) and occasional alveolar macrophages. C) Quantitative IHC for ACE2 was carried out on samples from non-ventilated patients (n = 20 patients). Total ACE2 expression from 5 low power fields is plotted relative to the patient's age at the time of specimen collection. A linear fit to the data is indicated by the dashed line with the 95% confidence interval highlighted in grey. D) The same specimens quantitated in (C) were normalized by cellularity and the average ACE2 expression per cell is plotted along with a linear fit to the data and its 95% confidence interval. Sections were stained for ACE2 using DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin. Figure 5 . Two patients on ACEI/ARB therapy exhibit intense endothelial ACE2 expression. A) Representative images of lung stained for ACE2 from an 83-year-old man in the organizing phase of diffuse alveolar damage are shown at low power (left, scale bar 200\u00b5m) and high power (right, scale bar 50\u00b5m). In addition to high ACE2 expression in reactive AT2 cells (green arrowheads), strong staining can be seen in numerous vascular endothelial cells (red arrowheads) throughout the thickened septal area in this patient on valsartan 4 days prior to specimen collection. B) Representative images of lung stained for ACE2 from a 53-year-old man with organizing diffuse alveolar damage superimposed on fibrosing interstitial lung disease are shown at low power (left, scale bar 200\u00b5m) and high power (right, scale bar 50\u00b5m). AT2 cell hyperplasia can be seen with lower level ACE2 expression present along the alveolar septum (green arrowheads). Strongly stained endothelial cells (red arrowheads) can be seen throughout the entire specimen from this patient who was on daily lisinopril at the time of specimen collection. Sections were stained for ACE2 using DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin.",

C) In normal human lung from a 23-year-old female, strong ACE2 expression is observed in AT2 cells (red arrowheads) along the alveolar septum at low power (top, scale bar 200\u00b5m) and in alveolar macrophages (green arrowhead). At high power (bottom, scale bar 50\u00b5m), ACE2 staining can be seen concentrated along the membrane of AT2 cells (red arrowheads) and within the cytoplasm of an alveolar macrophage (green arrowhead). Sections were stained for ACE2 using DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin.",
