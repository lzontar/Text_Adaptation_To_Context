Several studies have recently emerged but there is great benefit in aligning data collection efforts at a global scale. Objectives: Our mission is to scale-up COVID-19 data collection efforts and provide the MS community with data-driven insights as soon as possible. Methods: Numerous stakeholders were brought together. Small dedicated interdisciplinary task forces were created to speed-up the formulation of the study design and work plan. First step was to agree upon a COVID-19 MS core data set. Second, we worked on providing a user-friendly and rapid pipeline to share COVID-19 data at a global scale. Results: The COVID-19 MS core data set was agreed within 48 hours. To date, 23 data collection partners are involved and the first data imports have been performed successfully. Data processing and analysis is an on-going process. Conclusions: We reached a consensus on a core data set and established data sharing processes with multiple partners to address an urgent need for information to guide clinical practice.

With the current lack of robust data, approaches to the clinical management of MS during the pandemic diverge between countries. To overcome the insecurity, now and in the future, various COVID-19 data collection initiatives have recently been developed. 1 However, because of the relatively low prevalence of MS, 2 the absolute number of symptomatic COVID-19 infection in people also affected by MS is likely to be relatively low. This reduces the ability of single registries to achieve significant insights via individual national efforts.

In contrast, we believe indepth analyses of population-based data sources including history and follow-up information will be required to address some research questions, such as risks of COVID-19 in the MS population and contributing factors such as DMTs or the long-term effect on MS progression of having had a COVID-19 infection, which will require a longer term follow-up. We aim to achieve methodological insights during this global data sharing initiative that can stimulate this on-going and future scientific research led by others within the MS community.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Next steps"}, {"text": "The COVID-19 pandemic represents a humanitarian crisis on a colossal global scale and there is evidence that the crisis will not be solved soon, so initiatives to minimize the risks of COVID-19 are fundamental. For people living with MS, it is not only the threat to their health imposed by the virus itself but also the wider impact of reduced access to healthcare and medications that are essential for managing their symptoms, preventing relapses and reducing disability. PwMS and the healthcare professionals providing their care are in urgent need of evidence on which to base challenging clinical decisions. Uncertainty over the true threat of COVID-19 to PwMS has stimulated a cautious approach to preventing infection, including from the clinical community, patients themselves and many governments as well. PwMS are frequently classified as 'high risk' and advised to follow the strictest social distancing measures. These measures have reduced access to routine healthcare, including rehabilitation, exercise and sources of emotional support and as such come with significant risks to physical and mental health. There are several advantages of formulating global recommendations for data collection as rapidly as possible. These include, for example, providing a framework to enable data collection in a wider number of countries and regions; enabling comparative analysis of treatment regimens and outcomes across different countries; and reducing the time and cost of future collaborative research using COVID-19 and MS case data (compared to using retrospective data harmonization efforts).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "The prompt establishment of a global data sharing initiative due to the natural urgency is an ambitious undertaking. Nevertheless, we were able to motivate numerous stakeholders in the field of MS (neurologists, patient organizations, researchers, registries, etc.) to join our effort in bringing together data from patients, clinicians, registries and other COVID-19 in MS initiatives. We aim to continuously improve our approach while we move ahead. We hope the data sharing approach used here can be used as a template for different stakeholders to work together on an international scale also outside of the scope of the COVID-19 crisis.
