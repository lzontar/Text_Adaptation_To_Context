HDTs were responsible for only 12.9% and 9.9% of NOx and PM2.5 emissions from all vehicles, much lower than previous estimations (14, 15) , because of the implementation of a HDT low emission zone in Beijing. Compared to estimations for 2013 based on a similar bottom-up method (14, 15) , NOx and PM2.5 emissions from on-road traffic reduced by 43.5%-49.4% and 52.3%-55.3%, indicating the effectiveness of the continuous vehicular emission control measures. All these features influenced the role of local traffic emissions in air pollution. Fig. 2 -A shows the observed temporal variations of daily AQI and PM2.5 concentrations before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. The haze pollution became more severe during the Lockdown period compared to that in either the Pre period or the Transition period, with the mean daily PM2.5 level unexpectedly increasing from 48.0 \u03bcg/m3 to 99.0 \u03bcg/m3. Moreover, in the Lockdown period, half of the days were polluted with daily PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 75 \u03bcg/m3, the level II standard of the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The PM2.5 level remained at more than 150 \u03bcg/m3 for two episodes from January 25th to January 28th and February 11th to 13rd (the first of these was excluded from this analysis since it was probably caused by fireworks (16) ). The variation of PM2.5 concentrations on polluted days was seen as an asymmetric \"saw tooth\" pattern, rising slowly before two days and then falling abruptly (17) . Both in the Pre period and Lockdown period, these \"saw tooth\" periods were selected as the heavy pollution periods (HPPs), and other consecutive clean days (daily PM2.5 level less than 75 \u03bcg/m3) were defined as non-heavy pollution periods (NHPPs). In this study, we separate episodes of HPPs and NHPPs to make comparisons between the Pre period and the Lockdown period. Fig. 2 -A also shows the time series of the secondary aerosol enhancement, using the ratio of PM2.5 major secondary components (including sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and organic matter hereafter SNAO) to the elemental carbon (EC), to eliminate the impacts of the mixing-layer height on pollutant concentrations (18) . The ratios of SNAO to EC were stable between the Pre period and Transition period, while a significant rise was found in the Lockdown period under either the HPP or NHPP, with an average increase of 51.8% compared with that in the Pre period. We further investigated the changes in the diurnal variations of SNAO/EC between the Pre period and Lockdown period (Fig. 2-B) . The enhancement of secondary aerosols during the COVID-19 outbreak was evident during the entire day with a peak level in the early morning (9:00-10:00 a.m.).

Compared to the Pre period, NO3 radical concentrations also increased especially at night during the Lockdown period.

The O3 concentration increased by up to 16 parts per billion by volume (ppbv or nmol/mol) covering the northwest to the southeast of Beijing. The estimated vehicular NOx emission also showed an obvious decrease in the same areas, including urban areas within the 6th ring road and major freight corridors with massive HDTs (Fig. 2-E ). In addition, the surface ozone in southern downwind areas also increased most likely due to the prevailing north wind in NHPPs carrying high O3 and precursor gases concentrations from urban areas. As the O3 formation was VOC-limited in urban areas, the relatively larger emission reduction of NOx compared to VOCs raised the VOC/NOx ratio ( Fig. 1-C) , which consequently led to an increase in O3 concentrations (22) (23) (24) . By contrast, a relatively small emission reduction led to little changes or declines in O3 in western and northern rural areas, where O3 formation is in the transition or NOx-limited regimes (22) (23) (24) . When focused on emissions within urban areas from different sources, we found that on-road NOx emission reductions due to the lockdown were responsible for over half (53.4%) of total NOx emission decrease, while the ratio for VOCs was only 17.8%.

It indicates that local traffic emission reduction is the main driving force for the enhanced oxidization capacity in urban areas of Beijing. Compared to changes in O3 concentrations, the increase of NO3 radical was relatively small at the surface level because of the sharp decline of ambient NO2 concentrations ( Fig. 3-B) , while a more obvious enhancement was found in the upper air within urban areas (approximately 46m above the ground) due to relatively weak NO-titration effects (SI Appendix, Fig. S9 ).

Our results show that during the Pre period, the local sources only contributed 19.1% and 30.1% of PM2.5 concentrations in winter HPP and NHPP, respectively, which was much less than the results in previous researches with target years of 2012-2014 (44.0%-69.5%) (27) (28) (29) (30) . This was mainly owning to a more significant reduction of local emissions in Beijing compared to those of surrounding areas in recent years, particularly for the notable decline in local power and heating, industry, and residential sectors from 2013 to 2017 (7) .

Our modeling results showed that the enhancement of atmospheric oxidizing capacity during the Lockdown period was recognized in not only Beijing, but also most areas of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and its surrounding regions (SI Appendix, Fig. S11 ), consistent with recent research (31) . Differing from \"significant increased O3 but modest enhanced secondary aerosols\" in Beijing, the increased oxidants in the case of relatively abundant gaseous precursors outside Beijing facilitated more chemical formation of secondary organic and inorganic aerosols, which were transferred into Beijing and significantly increased the local secondary PM2.5 concentrations. The contributions of almost all local sources to PM2.5 and SNA concentrations decreased sharply during the Lockdown period, while the contribution of \"other\" local sources still remained at a normal level due to the important role of its NH3 emissions in the chemical growth of secondary inorganic aerosols.

Even during the Lockdown period, most of the heavy industries in Hebei province were still in continuous operation with little emission reductions (34) . On the other hand, since Beijing is already in the \"low concentration pool\" of BTH region, a significant enhanced local atmospheric oxidizing capacity caused by the imbalanced vehicular emission reduction of NOx and VOC, only leads to a modest increase of secondary aerosols and PM2.5 concentration due to the inadequate precursors.

In addition, based on a series of sensitivity runs modifying the local on-road emissions in winter normal days (Pre period), even without vehicle emissions, the ambient PM2.5 concentration could only be reduced by 1.2 \u03bcg/m3 on average in urban and southern rural areas of Beijing (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 ). Although vehicles accounted for 65.6% of local NOx emissions, the concentrations of oxidants and fine particles would be consistently enhanced, with the reduction ratio of the vehicular NOx emissions rising from 0% to 100%, even when VOC emissions from vehicles were reduced by 100%. On the one hand, the abundant nitrate precursors in neighboring regions suppresses the effectiveness of local NOx emission control. On the other hand, reducing NOx emission favors the enhanced atmospheric oxidation ability to form more secondary particles, since many urban areas in China are prevailing under the VOC-limited condition (36) . Although reducing vehicular VOC and primary PM emissions were both positive in decreasing the PM2.5 levels, unfortunately, traffic control usually leads to greater NOx reduction than VOCs, which goes to explain why the annual reduction of vehicular emissions has resulted in reductions in VOCs that are only half (in percentage terms) the NOx reductions over the past years (37) .

Compared to its surrounding regions, local sources in Beijing reduced faster in the past years, which lead to the share of regional transport for the air pollution in Beijing increasing to 76.1% on average in the winter. As for the differences in local species controls in Beijing, the reduction rate of NOx and VOCs emissions used to be approximately 1:1, while the ratio is still large enough to increase the atmospheric oxidizing capacity under the strong VOC-limited condition in winter, which is proved by the enhanced oxidants during the COVID-19 lockdown (7, 39) .

The real-time hourly air quality data (including NO2, O3, and PM2.5) based on Thermo Scientific samplers and analyzers, were obtained from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center (BJMEMC, http://zx.bjmemc.com.cn/). In addition, five dominant chemical components of PM2.5 including element carbon ( ), organic matter ( ), sulfate ( 4 2\u2212 ), nitrate ( 3 \u2212 ) and ammonium ( 4 + ) were discussed in detail, and observations were collected from the National Research Program for Key Issues in Air Pollution Control. In general, the model can capture the temporal and spatial variations of the air quality with correlation coefficients (R) higher than 0.5 of all species. The simulated hourly PM2.5 was well agreed with observations, with the overall model performance within the performance criteria suggested by Boylan and Russell (48) (Mean fractional bias (MFB) \u2264 \u00b160% and mean fractional error (MFE) \u2264 \u00b175%). The O3 concentrations were slightly underestimated, mainly due to uncertainties in emission inventory and unavoidable deficiencies during meteorological and air quality simulation. Table S4 showed their detailed performance statistics. The simulation errors for each species were relatively small, with MBs ranging from 0.3 \u03bcg/m3 to 4.3 \u03bcg/m3. However, all species were a little overestimated with NMBs (Normalized Mean Bias) ranging from 7.3% to 32.2%, especially for clean days (a day with 24-hour averaged PM2.5 concentration lower than 75 \u03bcg/m3). Since EC was mainly from the primary emissions, the uncertainties in emissions inventory and meteorological field were probably responsible for this overestimation. During the heavily polluted days, the revised model slightly overestimated the Moreover, we quantified the differences in PM2.5 and its species concentration between modeling results from CMAQv5.0.1-ISAM model with the observations (Table S4 ). In general, the simulation error of PM2.5 was also within the recommended criteria (MFB \u2264 \u00b160% and MFE \u2264 \u00b175%), and the performances in predicting EC and SNA (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium) were both similar with those of CMAQv5.2, with a small MBs ranging from 0.3 \u03bcg/m3 to 3.6 \u03bcg/m3. However, due to the lack of additional SOM formation pathways included in CMAQv5.2 (e.g. aging of S/IVOC and primary organic aerosol), the OM was underpredicted with a NMB of -62.6%, leading to a lower estimated PM2.5 concentration (49, 50) . As mentioned in section S3, since the SOM formation was not traced in the ISAM model due to the existing limitation, the underestimated SOM would not affect the source apportionment results. In sum, the predicted PM2.5 and its chemical components concentrations in both CMAQv5.2 and CMAQv5.0.1-ISAM showed a acceptable agreement with observations, which provided confidence in the source contribution as described in the results section of main text.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2737, "end": 2741, "text": "(49,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2742, "end": 2745, "text": "50)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 296, "end": 304, "text": "Fig. S16", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 326, "end": 334, "text": "Table S4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1447, "text": "Table S4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 2206, "end": 2215, "text": "(Table S4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Section S4 Evaluation of model performances"}, {"text": "The uncertainties of this research are mainly from the estimation of emission inventories and the WRF-CMAQ modeling system, as discussed below. 1 ) Vehicle emission inventories. The on-road emission inventory estimated by the SLOVE model was subject to a few inherent uncertainties and limitations, such as the systematic error of local speed-volume models and the emission factors chosen. In addition, HC emissions from other VEEs processes, including refueling loss, hot soak loss and diurnal loss, were not calculated in this study due to lack of related activity data. However, the traditional uncertainty estimation method (e.g. Monte-Carlo method) was not available for methods based on big data in this study due to large burden on computing time. Therefore, we compared our results with vehicle emissions from other previous studies using a similar bottom-up method (Fig. S6) (51), probably resulting in an overestimation of emissions. However, these uncertainties were relatively minor during the COVID-19 Lockdown period, as most of the industrial activities are largely limited and the emission was reduced to a low level. 3) WRF-CMAQ model. Although we have applied SLUCM in the WRF model and incorporated the heterogeneous reactions of SO2 into the CMAQ model to improve the predictions during haze pollution, there were still inevitable uncertainties due to the chemical processes and physical parameters. In addition, the sensitivity analysis by setting emission reduction scenarios in the WRF-CMAQ model may result in uncertainties of the O3 concentration due to its nonlinear relationship with its gaseous precursors. However, the model performances have been proved to be reliable in Section S4, which was in line with other recent modeling studies in Beijing (52, 53) . 4) ISAM model. Due to the limitation of the existing ISAM model, VOC emissions could not be tagged to trace the formation of SOM in the source apportionment. While the SOM was one of the major PM2.5 components in winter of Beijing, especially with a rapid growth during heavy pollution days ( Fig. 2-A) . Therefore, we probably underestimated the contribution of vehicle emissions to PM2.5 concentrations since (a) aromatics from gasoline vehicle exhausts is a critical determinant of urban secondary organic aerosol formation (54) and (b) synergetic oxidation of vehicular exhaust leads to efficient formation of ultrafine particles (UFPs) under urban conditions which was also not included in this model (55) . Quantification of vehiclar contribution to SOA and UFPs is necessary and suggested for future investigation. S19 .
