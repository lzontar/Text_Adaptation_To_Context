ARDS is characterized by a direct or indirect lung insult that results in the disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier and stimulates the proliferation of inflammatory mediators. An increase in protein-rich interstitial fluid results in the loss of surfactant, thereby impairing gas exchange and decreasing pulmonary compliance.

The approach to the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis is a challenge for clinicians due to the complex, multisystem nature of the disease [32] . The majority of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis do not require therapy due to the absence of symptoms, nonprogression of disease, and likelihood of spontaneous remission. For symptomatic patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, dyspnea remains the indicator for initiation of therapy. The goal of therapy is to relieve symptoms and reduce the burden of granulomatous inflammation. Oral glucocorticoids remain the first line therapy for relieving pulmonary symptoms, although steroids have not been shown to modify the overall course of the disease. For this reason, treatment with corticosteroids is usually reserved for patients with worsening symptoms or organ-threatening pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. The typical initial therapy for symptomatic sarcoidosis is prednisone 0.3-0.6 mg/kg ideal body weight for 4-6 weeks after which the patient should be reassessed (evaluation of symptoms, radiographic imaging, and PFTs). If the reassessment demonstrates stable or improved disease, the dosage can be tapered to 0.2-0.4 mg/kg for an additional 4-6 weeks. A maintenance dose of oral glucocorticoids can be continued at 0.25-0.5 mg/kg per day with reassessment at 4-12 week intervals. Length of therapy in patients who demonstrate positive response to oral glucocorticoids is unknown, although a 12-month treatment course is generally accepted to minimize relapses. There may be a role for inhaled steroids in the treatment of symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis; however, there is limited data to support their use. For patients who cannot Typically found in upper lung fields tolerate glucocorticoids, alternative regimens may include antimalarial drugs (chloroquine, hydroxhycholorquine) or immunosuppressive agents (methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide). Complications due to opportunistic infections while on immunosuppression therapy are rare, although clinicians should monitor patients for these risks.
