The number of cases follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion; we chose as a starting point in each country the first day di with 30 cases and we fitted for 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth. We looked then for linear correlations of the exponents \u03b1 with other variables, for a sample of 126 countries. We find a positive correlation, i.e. faster spread of COVID-19, with high confidence level with the following variables, with respective p-value: low Temperature (4\u00b710 \u22127 ), high ratio of old vs. working-age people (3\u00b710 \u22126 ), life expectancy (8 \u00b7 10 \u22126 ), number of international tourists (1 \u00b7 10 \u22125 ), earlier epidemic starting date di (2 \u00b7 10 \u22125 ), high level of physical contact in greeting habits (6 \u00b7 10 \u22125 ), lung cancer prevalence (6 \u00b7 10 \u22125 ), obesity in males (1 \u00b7 10 \u22124 ), share of population in urban areas (2 \u00b7 10 \u22124 ), cancer prevalence (3 \u00b7 10 \u22124 ), alcohol consumption (0.0019), daily smoking prevalence (0.0036), UV index (0.004, smaller sample, 73 countries), low Vitamin D serum levels (0.002 \u2212 0.006, smaller sample, \u223c 50 countries). There is highly significant correlation also with blood type: positive correlation with types RH-(2\u00b710 \u22125 ) and A+ (2\u00b710 \u22123 ), negative correlation with B+ (2\u00b710 \u22124 ). We also find positive correlation with moderate confidence level (p-value of 0.02 \u223c 0.03) with: CO2/SO emissions, type-1 diabetes in children, low vaccination coverage for Tuberculosis (BCG). Several of the above variables are correlated with each other and so they are likely to have common interpretations. Other variables are found to have a counterintuitive negative correlation, which may be explained due their strong negative correlation with life expectancy: slower spread of COVID-19 is correlated with high death-rate due to pollution, prevalence of anemia and hepatitis B, high blood pressure in females. We also analyzed the possible existence of a bias: countries with low GDP-per capita, typically located in warm regions, might have less intense testing and we discuss correlation with the above variables.",

The growth rate of the contagion has however a very high variability among different countries, even in its very early stages, when government intervention is still almost negligible. Any factor contributing to a faster or slower spread needs to be identified and understood with the highest degree of scrutiny. In [1] the early growth rate of the contagion has been found to be correlated at high significance with temperature T. In this work we extend a similar analysis to many other variables. This correlational study could help further investigation in order to find causal factors and it can help policy makers in their decisions.",

Subsequently the exponential growth typically gradually slows down, probably due to other effects, such as: lockdown policies from governments, a higher degree of awareness in the population or the tracking and isolation of the positive cases.

Such a simplistic interpretation is somehow contradicted by the case of generic cancer death rates, discussed in section III, which is indeed less significant than lung cancer.

In general also all RH-negative blood types correlate with faster COVID-19 contagion. It is interesting to compare with findings in clinical data: (i) our finding that blood type A is associated with a higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 is in good agreement with [26] , (ii) we find higher risk for group 0-and no correlation for group 0+ (while [26] finds lower risk higher risk for groups 0), (iii) we have a strong significance for lower risk for RH+ types and in particular lower risk for group B+, which is probably a new finding, to our knowledge.

In this respect, note that in countries where testing is not prevalent, registration of the illness is dependent on the development of severe symptoms. Hence, while this study is about infection rates rather than mortality, in quite a few countries we are actually measuring a proxy of mortality rather than infection rate. Hence, effects affecting mortality will be more relevant. Pre-existing lung conditions, diabetes, smoking and health indicators in general as well as pollution are likely to be important in this respect, perhaps not affecting \u03b1 per se but the detected amount of \u03b1. These are in turn generally correlated with GDP and temperature for historical reasons. Other interpretations, which may be complementary, are that co-morbidities and old age affect immune response and thus may directly increase the growth rate of the contagion. Similarly it is likely that individuals with co-morbidities and old age, developing a more severe form of the disease, are also more contagious than younger or asymptomatic individuals, producing thus an increase in \u03b1. In this regard, we wish to point the reader's attention to the relevant differences in correlations once we apply a threshold on GDP per capita. It has long been known that human wellness (we refer to a psychological happiness study [53] , but the point is more general) depends non-linearly on material resources, being strongly correlated when resources are low and reaching a plateau after a critical limit. The biases described above (weather comorbidity, testing facilities, pre-existing conditions and environmental factors) seem to reflect this, changing considerably in the case our sample has a threshold w.r.t. a more general analysis without a threshold.",

We find higher contagion to be moderately correlated only with and CO 2 /SO emissions. Instead we find a negative correlation with death rates due to air pollution and PM2.5 concentration (in contrast with [48] ). Note however that correlation with PM2.5 becomes non significant when combined with GDP per capita, while CO 2 /SO becomes non significant when combined with tourist arrivals. Finally death rates due to air pollution is also redundant when correlating with life expectancy.",

In the last column and row we show the p-value of each variable when performing a one-variable linear fit for the growth rate \u03b1. Note also that the fits that include vitamin D variables (D and Ds) and UV index are based on smaller samples than for the other fits, as explained in the text. The variables considered here are: Temperature (T), Old age dependency ratio(OLD), Life expectancy (LIFE), Number of tourist arrivals (ARR), Starting date of the epidemic (DATE), Amount of contact in greeting habits (GRE), Lung cancer (LUNG), Obesity in males (OBE), Urbanization (URB), UV Index (UV), GDP per capita (GDP), Alcohol consumption (ALCO), Daily smoking prevalence (SMOK), Prevalence of anemia in children (ANE), Death rate due to pollution (POLL), Prevalence of hepatitis B (HEP), High blood pressure in females (PRE), average vitamin D serum levels (D), seasonal vitamin D serum levels (Ds), CO2 emissions (CO2), type 1 diabetes prevalence (DIAB), BCG vaccination (BCG), percentage with blood of RH+ type (RH+), percentage with blood type B+ (B+).",
