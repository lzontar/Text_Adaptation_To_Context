In this context, it is attempted to reveal the effects of independent variables on CO 2 (dependent variable) for China from 1980 to 2013 (annual data) by implementing Phillips-Perron (PP), Zivot-Andrews unit root tests, FMOLS, DOLS, CCR, ARDL and GMM methods. According to results of FMOLS, DOLS and CCR models there is a long-term stable relationship between sea transportation, trade liberalization, industrial development and carbon dioxide emissions which is proved empirically. Similarly, Short term ARDL estimation results reveal that the main determinants of CO 2 in the short-run are changed in industrial development and maritime transport at 1% significance level. Table 6 summarizes the short-term ARDL results and the findings regarding the error correction model. According to Table 6 , error correction model works in order to reach short-run adjustment. In the short term, approximately 78% of shocks in industrial development, maritime transport and trade liberalization are compensated within a period of time and the system is re-established in the long term. China produced half of the 1.2 million electric media used worldwide; the government directs its attention to the rehabilitation and reuse of all these lithium-ion batteries. Large-scale production of biofuels can still be several years away. Crude oil might be very difficult to promote alternative fuels on a national scale unless crude oil prices surge so high as to become unaffordable. Authorities underline: China will become the world's number one economy. Now renewable energy will be more important, which should be encouraged to use by government on transportation so as to reduce the CO 2 emissions. However, China can be leader excess oil use for transport if they want to dominate the economy worldwide.",

The main cause of global warming is the very rapid increase in the rate of gases that cause the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere. The main gas causing the greenhouse effect through carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) gas emitted to the atmosphere by the use of fossil fuels such as gasoline, coal and natural gas. Mass production and excessive consumption, which started through the industrial revolution, increased energy needs and this requirement was met largely from fossil fuels. For many years, fossil fuel energy demand has reached exponential growth, causing pollution on the environment. Thus, the countries that focused on the economic growth target also caused the CO 2 emissions and global warming. The emergence of environmental pollution and industrialization has begun to be discussed in academic literature. One of the most important sources of this trend is the report \"The Limits to Growth\" prepared by the Roman Club in 1972. According to the report, \"If the current growth of industrialization continues in terms of food production, consumption of natural resources and CO 2 emissions, economic growth will damage the environment in our world in the next 100 years\" [1] .",

In this sense, local consumption in any country is incrementally performed throughout the world of supply chain. The transportation sector has developed through industrialization process and as a result carbon emissions has increased day by day especially in certain countries. Therefore, in this case, it imposed some restrictions in terms of trade and supply chain. Trade liberalization, transportation, industrial development and CO 2 are widely discussed regarding the environmental consequences of trade in academic literature. Hassan and Nosheen [2] investigate the effects of trade openness energy usage and economic growth on carbon dioxide leakage in terms of EKC hypothesis for Pakistan by implementing yearly data beginning from 1980 to 2016. In order to reach the results they implement econometric models including ADF unit root test, Johnsen co-integration test to reveal the long-term relationship between variables and vector error correction. According to their findings, economic growth is positively connected with carbon dioxide leakage. Population growth and trade liberalization have a considerably negative effect on CO 2 leakage during the short-term, whereas, in the long-term, the course is opposite. In addition, Granger causality test indicates that a bi-directional causality acts from energy consumption and economic growth to CO 2 leakage. One-way causalities running from trade liberalization to CO 2 emissions as well. Jebli and Belloumi [3] state that sea transportation, waste usage and combustible renewables significantly affect the carbon dioxide emissions, while any rise in sea transportion reduce the consumption of combustible renewables and waste usage. Besides, sea transportation is significantly correlated with carbon dioxide leakage, demonstrating that the Tunisian transportation is so contaminated due to the excessive non-renewable energy consumption.",

Past works demonstrate that when the continental sea transport is performed especially in 90-150\u00b0E,40-60\u00b0N, it causes CO 2 emissions. Zhu, Yuen, Ge and Li's [5] the findings indicate that sea transport emissions in terms of trading system can motivate main actors to benefit from new technologies, provide more carbon efficient vessels in terms of green energy. Besides, the efficacy of sea transport emissions trading system is more obvious when bunker fuel prices are excessive. In this sense, the findings ascertain that bunker fuel prices have a larger impact on CO 2 reduction than implementing stricter CO 2 allowance allocation as well. Their work involves the formulation of sea transport emissions trading system policies and ensures suggestions in order to decrease the sea transport emissions to fulfill the shipping industry's impetus by providing its environmental performance.",

Thus, exploitation of the natural resources can cause undesirable environmental effects including excessive CO 2 leakage, air pollution and erosion.

In addition, lowering import tariff causes CO 2 emissions and the costs of abating the trade-induced CO 2 emission are relative to the welfare gains of free trade. In this context, analysis of the trade-induced CO 2 emissions demonstrates distinct differences among emissions caused by lowering import tariff on energy products and by on non-energy products. It demonstrates distinct differences in leakage responses between developing countries as well. Managi, Hibiki and Tsurumi [13] point out that the effect of trade liberalization on environmental pollution by implementing the instrumental variables technique. They show that the effect is considerable in the long-run, after the dynamic adjustment process, although it is small in the short-run and trade is determined as an advantageous factor in terms of the environment in OECD economies. It has prejudicial impact, however, on CO 2 leakage and sulfur dioxide SO 2 in non-OECD economies, although it does lower biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) emissions in these countries. Consequently, trade liberalization affects CO 2 leakage by way of the environmental regulation impact and capital influence.",

In 2017 China produced half of the 1.2 million electric media used as worldwide; the government directs its attention to the rehabilitation and reuse of all these lithium-ion batteries. Large-scale production of biofuels can still be several years away. Crude oil might be very difficult to promote alternative fuels on a national scale unless crude oil prices surge so high as to become unaffordable. Developing battery science, solar panels and electricity are obtained from the sun rays. This obtained energy is also included in the systems to assist the ship's shipbuilding auxiliary power or ship's daily use needs. Some certain industries are using the solar panels for production. First looked at the solar panel due to the attitude and the cost of initial setup, it is necessary to actively wait for the future in the maritime industry. Therefore, first step reuse of waste energy CO 2 emissions can be reduced. Thus, since the amount of fuel consumed by the ship decreases, the amount of CO 2 emissions decreases. Moreover, methods to reduce CO 2 emissions include reducing fuel costs and using alternative fuels with low or zero carbon content. Therefore, carbon emissions will be greatly reduced with burning low emission's fuel in diesel engines.",

It is possible to achieve 1% energy efficiency with this system. It is used not only to reduce CO 2 emissions, also to reduce SO2 emissions. It is possible to achieve 1% energy efficiency with this system. Four types of engines are used in the manufacturing industry in the world, and these are equivalent engines IE1, IE2, IE3 and IE4, IE4 motors are the least energy consuming and most efficient motors in the world. In order to make the use of IE4 engines more common, efforts to reduce the cost of such machines should be given importance. However, roller bearing is usually found in automated machines such as CNC, and their usage rate should be increased with R&D supports by government. Intelligent start-stop systems are widely used today. Logically, the software is thrown in batteries electronic circuit, so that parameters are protected without the need for high energy. Thus, the machine start-up setup time is eliminated, and the machine can be used for longer production. This system should be applied in all machines with PLC panels and even adding start-stop batteries to the low-tech machines together with the panel will provide CO 2 emissions, energy consumption and high profitability. Uninsulated and high-volume environments are cooled by fans in enterprises, resulting in high energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. As an alternative system, the environment cooling system that works by rotating cold water in the company is much cheaper and environmentally friendly.",

Combining with all the estimated elasticities of scale and technique influences, composition impacts and trade intensity on CO 2 leakage, found that raising trade volume has opposite effects on CO 2 emissions because of different pollutants. Both SO2 and dust fall cause emissions, whilst trade openness decreases emissions. Oh and Bhuyan [17] examine the linkage among energy usage, GDP, trade liberalization, and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) leakage in Bangladesh from 1975 to 2013. They use ARDL bounds test to cointegration for establishing the existence of a long-term linkage. Conversely, the estimated coefficients for trade openness and GDP are negative both in short-term and long-term. They recommend that the government of Bangladesh should support the appropriate policy to use alternative energy facilities which would not emit much CO 2 . Zandi and Haseeb [18] investigate the effect of trade openness on CO 2 emissions. They implemented the panel data analysis for 105 developed and developing countries from the period of 1990 to 2017. The findings of FMOLS and DOLS verify that all variables are linked in the long-term. The findings of long-term coefficient verify that the trade openness has a positive impact on CO 2 emissions and cause to increase environmental pollution. The findings of heterogeneous panel causality verify that there is a one way causal linkage among trade openness and environmental pollution where causality is running from trade openness to environmental pollution. Besides, they determine a two-way causal linkage of environmental pollution with renewable energy utilization in all chosen countries. Ozatac, Gokmenoglu and Taspinar [19] examined the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for Turkey from the period of 1960 to 2013 by considering the energy usage, trade openness, financial development and CO 2 emissions. The findings of the ARDL bound test and the error correction model through autoregressive distributed lag mechanism demonstrated long-term",
