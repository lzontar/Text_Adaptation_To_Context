There are few studies addressing what factors might predict poor outcomes in this patient population. The purpose of the current study was to investigate characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with HRF. Methods A study of patients \u2265 18 years admitted with HRF in a 1-year period. Patients with limited life expectancy related to other conditions, and those with a non-respiratory cause of HRF, were excluded. Results 202 subjects met eligibility criteria: 24% had a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, 6% obesity hypoventilation, 46% chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 10% asthma. Fifteen (7%) died during the index admission. Forty-one patients (23%) were readmitted within 30 days: peripheral vascular disease [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.78, CI 1.45-15.74] and tachycardia (aOR 2.97, CI 1.22-7.26) were associated with an increased risk of readmission. Sixty-six patients (36%) died after discharge. Risk of death was increased in older patients (aOR 1.32, CI 1.13-1.54 per 5 years), those with peripheral vascular disease (aOR 12.56, CI 2.35-67.21), higher Charlson co-morbidity index (aOR 1.39, CI 1.09-1.76), use of home oxygen (aOR 4.03, CI 1.89-8.57), and those who had been readmitted (aOR 3.07, CI 1.46-6.43). Conclusions Hospitalization for HRF is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Our observation that home oxygen use was associated with increased mortality suggests that oxygen use could be a risk factor for death in patients with HRF.",

Our results suggest that patients admitted with a diagnosis of HRF have significant mortality during their index admission, a high 30-day readmission rate, and a high mortality rate overall. Certain characteristics independently identify patients at particularly high risk of adverse outcomes: older age, a diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, and use of home oxygen. Patients with HRF have a high mortality rate during their index admission-in the current study, 7% died during their index admission. There are few prior studies reporting on the inpatient mortality of patients with HRF, as most prior publications have focused exclusively on patients admitted with acute HRF requiring NIV. Ahmed reported that 53% of patients requiring NIV died during hospitalization and Lemyze found a 30% mortality rate among obese patients treated with NIV for acute respiratory failure [18] . Our study differs from these prior studies, which focused only on patients requiring NIV, which likely explains the lower initial mortality rate observed in our study.",

            "text": "Certain co-morbidities were associated with an increased risk of 30-day readmission. Active smokers were less likely to be readmitted, but this was not significant in multi-variate regression, suggesting that still smoking was related to some other factor such as perhaps reduced overall level of chronic illness, rather than an independent factor. A diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease identified patients at particularly high risk of readmission in multivariate regression analysis. Peripheral vascular disease has been identified as a risk factor for readmission following catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [23] , percutaneous coronary intervention [24] , admission for heart failure [25] and acute hospitalizations in older adults [26] , suggesting that peripheral vascular disease may particularly be a marker of chronic illness severity that increases risk of readmission for patients. Another factor that predicted an increased risk of 30-day readmission in this cohort was tachycardia during the first 24 h of the index hospitalization. Tachycardia would appear to be a factor limited to acute illness during the index admission. We are not able to explain why this would predicted subsequent 30-day readmission, but perhaps it is a marker of chronic cardiovascular dysfunction, which might predict increased risk. Identifying these patients as being at high risk of 30-day readmission may be a first step to providing targeted interventions to prevent readmission. Only 17% of patients were discharged on any form of ventilatory support [and this included only continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP)]. Use of CPAP or BIPAP did not appear to affect outcomes, but as there were so few participants discharged on these modalities, it is somewhat difficult to interpret these data. Thirty two percent of patients admitted with HRF had comorbid OSA or obesity hypoventilation, indications for ventilatory support, and so there are likely many patients who could have benefited from institution of CPAP, BIPAP or NIV on discharge for these indications. There are also likely to be patients with chronic pulmonary disease that might benefit from ventilatory support: Murphy et al. reported that NIV for patients with persistent hypercapnia and hypoxemia 2-4 weeks following hospital discharge significantly reduced the risk of readmission or death at 12 months [27] , and Kohnlein et al. reported that an NIV intervention in patients with chronic hypercapnia targeting reduction in Pa CO 2 significantly reduced 12 month mortality [28] . Some patients with COPD likely have the overlap syndrome (overlap of COPD with OSA), and an observational study by Marin et al. suggested that treatment of such patients with CPAP reduces the risk of death and COPD exacerbation [2] . The data supporting NIV for patients with COPD suggests this intervention is most effective when initiated after the acute exacerbation, so it is possible that many patients were not discharged on CPAP or BIPAP as it was not deemed medically necessary, though such patients should be closely followed up on discharge. Our study suggests that there may be an opportunity to increase the rate of ventilatory support for some patients.",

A number of co-morbidities and factors were more common in those who died, but factors that were independent risk factors for death Bold values indicate statistical significance OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval a Among those admitted to the ICU (n = 103) b Based on Quan et al. [15] c Among those readmitted (n = 95) d 38-41% Data missing included age, use of home oxygen, Charlson co-morbidity index, diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease and hospital readmission. Age and hospital readmission are both factors that will obviously increase risk of death. The Charlson comorbidity index has been designed and validated as a predictor of death [15] , and so this was also to be expected. The fact that peripheral vascular disease-a risk factor for 30 day readmission-was also a risk factor for death in patients with HRF was unexpected. We do not know the reason that peripheral vascular disease increases the risk of adverse outcomes related to HRF, though certainly it is a risk factor for readmission related to cardiovascular disease as noted above. It is possible that the combination of vascular insufficiency and respiratory insufficiency is a physiological combination that particularly increases risk of poor outcomes. Another interesting observation was the fact that use of chronic home oxygen was associated with increased risk of death. It is certainly possible that use of home oxygen is a marker of more advanced disease, but it is conceivable that home oxygen in patients with HRF could actually be harmful, as it may mask worsening disease related to hypercapnia, and even exacerbate hypercapnia through worsened ventilation:perfusion matching [29] . There are some limitations to the current data. This was a single center investigation which may limit generalizability, but does improve the internal validity of the study as data available via the electronic medical record were consistent across patients-our findings provide the basis for future studies at multiple sites. Another limitation is that patients were identified using ICD 10.0 codes for HRF; patients who were misidentified with HRF could have been included, others not identified with HRF would have been missed and not included in our analysis. However, as we reviewed all the medical records and excluded participants we felt had other reasons for HRF (such as cardiac arrest, seizure or neuromuscular disease) or limited life expectancy (related to advanced cancer, or conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would limit life expectancy to less than three months), this should be pertinent to patients suffering with HRF that would otherwise be expected to survive. On review of the electronic record, the authors felt that 80% of the deaths and admissions were definitely or possibly related to hypercapnic respiratory failure.",

Admission with HRF is a marker of patients at risk of poor outcomes. Certain factors are associated with particularly poor outcomes such as increased age, increased chronic comorbidities, and the presence of peripheral vascular disease. It is notable that use of home oxygen was associated with an increased risk of death-independent of other factors-and that few patients were treated with CPAP or BIPAP and none with NIV: it is possible that oxygen alone may actually be harmful in this patient population.
