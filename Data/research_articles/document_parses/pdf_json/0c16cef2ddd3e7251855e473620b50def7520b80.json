            "text": "This topic has been difficult to evaluate, as the intervention under scrutiny (EWSS/response teams/MET systems) is a complex one and the outcomes being measured (reduced cardiac and respiratory arrests) are impacted by factors other than the specific intervention being studied. For example, during the period of most studies there has been a major international focus on improving other aspects of patient safety, e.g., hospital acquired infections, earlier treatment of sepsis and better medication management, all of which have the potential to influence patient deterioration and may have a beneficial impact on reducing cardiac arrests and hospital deaths. Additionally, a greater focus on improving \"end of life\" care and the making of \"do not attempt resuscitation\" (DNAR) decisions may also have had impact on cardiac arrest call rates. The studies do not correct se confounding factors. for the The Rapid Response System has several components (an event detection and response triggering arm, a planned response arm, a quality monitoring arm, and an administrative support arm) -some of which may be important in changing outcomes, some of which may not. It may of course also be the case that all components should be present, and functioning optimally, for benefit to be achieved. The components include staff education, vital signs monitoring, recognition of deterioration using early warning systems or calling criteria, systems for calling for help and the response (the Rapid Response Team). There are no data isolating the impact of one arm from the other 3 so it is impossible to determine the magnitude of each arm's contribution to an outcome effect (if any). Consequently, evaluations may have to be of the whole system (or \"bundle of care\") rather then any single component. Determining how best to perform the function of each arm may be important, as some significant impact may be achieved at a lower cost, and improvements in certain components might not be associated with cost-effective improvements in outcome.",

For example, efforts aimed at improving the recognition and treatment of cardiac arrest have enjoyed greater visibility than those aimed at its prevention. Published evidence shows that ward staff education in preventing patient deterioration has been poor, vital signs monitoring has often been infrequent and inadequate, early warning systems or calling criteria have not always been used, there were no routinely used systems for calling for help and the response from responders to requests for help have sometimes been found wanting. One of the greatest difficulties in interpreting the data is the fact that almost no organization has chosen to compare an improved existing system with a newly implemented Rapid Response System. Hence, it is difficult to assess whether the introduction of a Rapid Response System per se was actually required to solve the problem. Of course, it could be argued that efforts to improve detection of deterioration, improving response to deterioration, improving the education staff resulting in error reduction, and improving the staff and equipment support for crisis response is itself a Rapid Response System.",

A number are of poor scientific quality and provide inadequate data on which to make a definitive conclusion about the benefit, or not, of the Rapid Response System. Factors such as the Hawthorne effect, the impact of publicity in newspapers and medical journals concerning \"failure to rescue\", secular trends in cardiorespiratory arrests, changing case-mix and patient admission numbers over duration of studies, and alterations in DNAR decision rates have the potential to influence the findings considerably. However, due to the before and after design of most studies, their potential impact is unaccounted for in the reports. Where these \"before-and-after\" studies suggest an impact on cardiac arrest rates, it is important to understand that this does not necessarily signify causality.

In this RCT, both arms demonstrated improved outcome compared to baseline, results in line with all before-and-after trials. Post-hoc analysis (to determine a potential source of the demonstrated outcome improvement) of the data from this study using intervention rate (number of MET calls)-an as-treated analysis-shows that there was a downward trend for cardiac arrests and unexpected deaths that was present and identical in both control and MET hospitals during the study period. Still, these results do not rule out the possibility that any benefit is due to a particular component of a RRS (including simply an educational effect, or increasing the awareness of the adverse consequences of physiological instability, or the result of an increase in DNAR decisions.",

The system of care (RRS) is possible to measure if there is appropriate assessment for process measures to demonstrate the system was actually functional, A failure to account for many of the confounding factors in the reviewed papers makes it difficult to come to a definite conclusion about whether the use of EWSS or response team systems compared with no such responses decrease cardiac arrests or mortality. Rapid Response Systems may decrease these outcomes, but the level of evidence is not high. It seems logical, and inexpensive, to ensure that education about deterioration and its detection, better vital signs monitoring of patients, greater use of calling criteria or early warning scores, and a system of calling for assistance are in place. Whether it is necessary to introduce a specific Rapid Response Team, rather than an improved local response at ward level, is as yet untested. There do not appear to be any ill effects of introducing a Rapid Response System, although Rapid Response Teams cannot usually be intr duced without introducing all four arms of the system. Cost, and cost-effectiveness has not yet been o studied. Acknowledgements: S ugg st e ion areas for future research 1. Given the finding that, in some studies, clinical benefit resulted from education about the MET and the calling criteria, the importance of each of the components of the rapid response system -education, monitoring, calling criteria, ation of staff regarding appropriate mechanism of calling and response should be evaluated.

As more than 90% of deaths in the study hospitals were preceded by a formal DNAR order, this activity might be important. Thus, in RRS hospitals, patients may still die but not be counted as an unexpected cardiac arrest or unexpected death.

This may in part explain the decreases seen in both total and unplanned ICU admissions that we observed. The 35 patients who had their resuscitation status changed by the RRT also influenced the incidence of cardiac arrests, although not the overall mortality rates. An arrest was recognized only if a resuscitation attempt was made, whereas mortality rates were calculated based on total deaths regardless of resuscitation status. However, even adding these 35 arrests to the total for the study period still leaves a sizable impact on the arrest rate by the RRT. The fact that without the RRT, 10% of patients would have been subject to life support interventions that they did not desire is a topic that should be investigated in future studies. Although the case mix index of all hospitalized patients was the same in the year before and during the first year of the RRS, this does not adequately account for differences in acuity that might have been present. Nursing staffing patterns were also generally unchanged, but we could not account for day-to-day variations in unit staffing that might have affected recognition of a decompensating patient. A type of Hawthorne effect in which staff performance improves due to knowledge of observation is likely also at play. Finally, other quality improvement projects were ongoing, although the RRS was the major improvement project undertaken during the study period. Comparison groups were clearly defined.

Assuming 47,000 admission per year (as reported), this means a reduction from 258 to 160. Unanticipated cardiac arrests (excluding respiratory arrests): reduced from 2.53 to 0.95 per 1000 admissions (p<0.001) in first full calendar year after MET introduction (2006). Assuming 47,000 admission per year (as reported), this means a reduction from 118 to 45. BUT in the years 2005 and 2006, there were a reported 1931 MET calls at which the DNAR status was changed at 8%. This means 154 patients seen by MET had DNAR status changed and therefore an average of 77 per year, which could account entirely for the reduced cardiac arrest rate. ICU admissions from in-patient wards: reduced from 42.3 + 7.3 to 36.6 + 5.1 (p=0.05) Readmission to ICU (overall): reduced from 13.5 to 8.8 per month (p=0.01) Readmission to ICU within 48 hrs of ICU discharge: reduced from 4.4 to 2.8 per month (p=0.01) Major post-op complications: reduced from 69 + 25.3 to 60 + 23.8 per 100 procedures (p<0.01) Overall mortality unchanged (3.57% vs 3.55%)There were apparently favourable trends, but no SD, in:",

The study included six control (non-RRS) patient care units (90 beds) with predominantly cardiology, hematology, and oncology patients. The intervention (RRS) units included four general medical patient care units (60 beds). Patients with a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status were eligible for treatment by the MET, but patients with a comfort-measures-only (CMO) status were not candidates for use of the RRS.

The admitting diagnoses reflect the different services across the units, and these diagnoses were not significantly different between the baseline and intervention periods. A total of 25 admissions (0.2%) were excluded from analysis because of transfer between RRS and non-RRS units.Cardiac arrests: During the study, there were 28 cardiac arrests (16 on the non-RRS units and 12 on the RRS units).

In addition to setting expectations for recognition and response, the program includes a time line for the escalation of care when a physician response is not appropriate or timely. Regardless of the need for escalation, the clinical triggers program explicitly requires that the resident notify the attending physician of a rapid response call within four hours of the event.The authors conclude that outreach may have led to greater detection of myocardial infarctions while reducing the incidence of other serious adverse events. Comment: LOE3, poor, neutral Comparison groups were clearly defined, but wrong data was used for control phase. The outcomes were measured in the same (but un-blinded) objective way in both groups Not all confounders were identified and appropriately controlled for (small selected groups of patients, DNAR rates, secular trends, admission numbers). The follow-up of patients was sufficiently long and complete for the stated outcomes.Single centre prospective, controlled, before-and-after trial. The authors examined the incidence of 11 serious adverse events before and after the appointment of an IMPACT team in three surgical groups (1) vascular: abdominal aortic repair, carotid endarterectomy, lower limb revascularisation;(2) orthopaedic: hip replacement, knee replacement, repair of fractured neck of femur; and (3) colorectal: colonic resection. End-points were adverse events during the first three days after discharge to the general wards (primary end point) and 30-day mortality. One patient could have more than one serious adverse event on more than one day.During the Baseline Phase, the Acute Pain Service tended to focus on pain-related matters.Intervention was the IMPACT team (a nurse and a consultant anaesthetist or anaesthesia trainee) systematically reviewing the patients from the same surgical groups of patients as the Baseline Phase. Patients were extensively reviewed both from an acute pain and a critical care outreach perspective to review high-risk patients and intervene where necessary for first three post-op days. Where appropriate, the team suggested or initiated patient care strategies including use of the well established MET.On weekdays, both a doctor and a nurse reviewed the patients. At weekends, an anaesthesia trainee working alone saw the patients. This makes it difficult to separate any hangover effects of the outreach nurse study or to really evaluate the impact of whatever response (? Pain team) was in place IMMEDIATELY before the IMPACT team.During the Baseline and IMPACT Phases, the proportion of individual patients having serious adverse events was the same at 14% (95% confidence intervals: 6% absolute decrease to 6% absolute increase during the intervention phase, p = 1.0).During the IMPACT Phase, there were about 850 interventions. The most frequent direct interventions were oxygen therapy, aggressive fluid management and changes in pain management (Table 4 ). Many of the interventions involved patient education or patient specific education of nursing or medical staff.There were 23 serious adverse events per 100 patients during the Baseline Phase compared to 16 serious adverse events per 100 patients during the IMPACT Phase BUT in the intervention limb of the outreach study there were already only 18 per 100 patients (absolute decrease of 5 serious adverse events per 100 patients).The authors state that, comparing the IMPACT Phase to the Baseline Phase, a similar proportion of patients had serious adverse events but the number of events per patient decreased. This may be true, but they fail to report the already lower rate in the previously reported outreach study.They also report that the Baseline Phase 30-day mortality was 9% and report that this decreased to 3% during the IMPACT Phase. However, in the intervention limb of the outreach study 30-day mortality was already only 7%.Although the authors claim that decrease in serious adverse events and mortality was associated with the presence of the combined acute pain and critical care outreach service, there are other possible explanations. Firstly, the vascular surgeons introduced a general physician to review their patients both before and after surgery between the Baseline and IMPACT Phases (no data to allow examination of the effects of this change). Second, the vascular surgery group of patients was smaller during the IMPACT Phase than during the Baseline Phase. A third possible explanation is the greater use of the Medical Emergency Team. ",
