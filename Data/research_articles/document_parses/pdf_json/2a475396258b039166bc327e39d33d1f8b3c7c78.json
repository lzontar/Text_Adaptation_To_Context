The outbreak of virus infection has aroused great concern of the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 is highly infectious and has a high infection rate. So far, no specific drug has been found to cure it. China as one of the first countries attacked by epidemic has shown outstanding in fighting against the COVID-19. The contribution of traditional Chinese medicine can not be ignored. As a kind of representative of traditional Chinese medicine, the Chinese patent medicine injection has significant effect in reducing the clinical symptoms of patients and preventing the deterioration of the disease. However, there is no systematic review of its efficacy and safety. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese patent medicine injection in the treatment of COVID-19.",

[4] Spain is currently one of the countries most affected by COVID-19, with 210,773 confirmed cases as of April 28, 2020. [5] Similarly, Italys situation is no better. [6] The main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients were fever, cough and fatigue, and some patients also had nasal congestion, runny nose, and diarrhea. [7] COVID-19 can spread from person to person, [8, 9] and is highly infectious, with a variety of transmission modes (droplets, close contact, faecal, etc.). [10, 11] The population is generally susceptible to infection. Western medicine mainly adopts antiviral, oxygen therapy, nutritional support and other standard supportive treatment, [12, 13] but there is still a lack of specific drugs. [14] Vaccine development is progressing rapidly, but the first wave of the pandemic may not be contained. [15] In traditional Chinese medicine, COVID-19 is classified as \"epidemic disease\", which is caused by the feeling of the Qi of disease.

At present, many authoritative experts of traditional Chinese medicine believe that COVID-19 may be related to dampness, heat, toxin, blood stasis, Qi deficiency, turbid toxin and turbid dampness. [17, 18] In the fight against COVID-19 epidemic, Chinese medicine played a significant role. The specific manifestations are as follows: the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine can reduce the clinical symptoms of common patients, shorten the course of treatment, and promote healing; for severe and critical patients, it can reduce the lung exudation, control the inflammatory overreaction, and prevent the deterioration of the disease; for patients in the recovery period, it can remove the residual pathogens, support the healthy qi, and promote the recovery of the body. [18] As a new and unprecedented infectious disease, COVID-19 has become a global concern of the World Health Organization (WHO) because of its rapid spread around the world. [19] The early intervention of traditional Chinese medicine and the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine are important means to improve the cure rate of the COVID-19 and reduce the mortality. [20] Therefore, it is necessary for us to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese patent medicine injection in the treatment of COVID-19 based on the existing evidence. In order to better guide the clinical application of Chinese patent medicine injection for COVID-19 and provide better treatment options. It is urgently needed to accomplish this review.",

Since the outbreak of the epidemic, Chinese medicine has been widely used in the treatment of COVID-19 and has played a prominent role in disease prevention and control. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese patent medicine injection in the treatment of COVID-19 and to explore the role of Chinese medicine in the treatment of COVID-19. At present, relevant studies have reported that integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment can safely and effectively reduce the clinical symptoms of patients, reduce the case fatality rate and the conversion rate of critically ill patients. [25, 26] Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine is a potential treatment method for COVID-19. This study will systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese patent medicine injection for COVID-19 based on available evidence. The presentation of these results will provide better options and more compelling evidence for clinical treatment. Considering that there may be many studies that have not yet been published, more high-quality clinical evidence will need to be updated to ensure the integrity of the evidence in this study. ",
