The risk of complications and mortality increases with age and significant comorbidities (1) , such as patients residing in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Poor and vulnerable patient populations are disproportionately impacted by disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Among those, patients with severe mental illness may be especially vulnerable due to a variety of factors including those relating to housing (housing insecurity or increased risk of exposure in residential treatment centers or prison settings) effects of underlying disease, side effects of medications, poor access to healthcare and lifestyle factors such as smoking (2, 3) . As of May 11, 2020 , nearly 4.2 million patients have been infected world-wide, many of which are associated with LTCFs. Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a significant cause of death for patients with schizophrenia (4, 5) . Given the absence of effective treatment for COVID-19, factors that could exacerbate immune dysfunction in vulnerable patient populations require close scrutiny.",

Concentrations of RIS and PAL were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis as previously reported (Motyl et al., 2017) . Briefly, RIS and PAL were extracted from both plasma and bone marrow via protein precipitation with acetonitrile. Separation was accomplished using a Waters XBridge C18 analytical column (3.0 x 50 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm). Mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in purified water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B). The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min, and heated to 60\u00b0C. Gradient elution was employed, with initial conditions 95% A and 5% B. Solvent composition was held at the initial conditions for 1.0 minutes, and then was ramped over the following 1.5 minutes to 95% B. Composition was maintained at 95% B for 1 minute. RIS and PAL were detected via an Agilent (Waldbronn, Germany) 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive ion MRM mode. The following transitions were monitored: RIS (411.2\u2192191.0) and PAL (427.2\u2192207.0).",

Two hours post-injection, mice were sacrificed by CO 2 asphyxiation and blood was collected for subsequent analysis. Circulating cytokine, chemokine, and other immune factor levels were quantified using the Proteome Profiler Cytokine Array (R&D BioSystems) per the manufacturer's instructions. Arrays were imaged using a FluorChem Q instrument and quantified using ImageQuant v. 8.2. Each duplicate array spot representing a unique immune marker was normalized to each of three reference spots per array (N = 3 measurements per spot). Normalized measurements were averaged for each spot, and the duplicate spots for each feature were then averaged to generate a total measure for each immune marker. Unique arrays were run for each animal. Statistical significance signaling a change in response to inflammatory challenge was determined for each immune factor by two-tailed t test between D VEH/ L VEH and D VEH/LPS groups, and RIS/ L VEH and RIS/LPS groups. Factors with the same effect observed between D VEH and RIS group relative to their respective controls were considered unaffected, whereas those with a different effect were considered dysregulated.

Pathways involving measured features that are not linked to immune function or infectious disease responses were not included in the analysis. Immune marker levels of D VEH-treated mice following exposure to LPS relative to levels of D VEH-treated mice following exposure to L VEH were considered a normal, functional response (regardless of change). The numbers of immune markers in RIS-treated mice that had a normal response following exposure to LPS relative to RIStreated, L VEH-exposed mice (i.e., that of D VEH/LPS mice) were tabulated. RIS-treated mice that had a significantly different response from D VEH/LPS mice were also tabulated. Heat maps reflecting the relative functionality and dysregulation of each KEGG pathway analyzed were generated. Each immune factor present at abnormal levels following LPS challenge during RIS treatment in a pathway was allotted proportional wavelength in their assigned color on a scale from 55 nm to 255 nm (dysregulated factors = red; factors at normal levels = green). Multiple factors contributing to either functionality or dysregulation contribute additively to color intensity.",

Oral administration of RIS or D VEH continued through day 14, when mice were sacrificed as described above. Anti-pneumococcal IgG antibodies were quantified by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (myBioSource) per manufacturer's instructions. Intensity of the chromogenic substrate 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine plus 2N H 2 SO 4 stop solution was detected using an M5 SpectraMax plate reader (optical density \u019b = 450nm). Statistical significance indicating a change in capacity for antibody production in response to vaccination was determined by one-tailed t test between D VEH/VAX and RIS/VAX groups. Individuals were defined as \"responders\" or \"non-responders\" by \u03c7 2 analysis between both D VEH/ V VEH and D VEH/VAX groups and RIS/ V VEH and RIS/VAX groups.",

Our previous preclinical studies demonstrated profound impact of AA administration on inflammatory and adaptive immune factors in multiple tissues (blood, heart, liver) in the absence of substantial immune challenge (9) (10) (11) .

This suggests that it is plausible to expect a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19 infection in patients using AA drugs in an outpatient setting (for diverse psychiatric indications) as well as those in in-patient behavioral health centers, LTCFs, and the prison system. Our findings showing inflammatory and adaptive immune process dysregulation by RIS are especially troubling given the emerging understanding of inflammatory sepsis preceding rapid death in COVID-19 patients. Recent reports have implicated Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)mediated signaling in patient responses to COVID-19, making our observations of dysregulated response to the TLR4 agonist LPS highly relevant. Cytokines and chemokines that increase during normal TLR4 signaling responses include TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, IL-8, CCL5, MIP1-\u03b1, MIP1-\u03b2, CxCL10, CxCL9, and CxCL11 (15) . Of the 8 evaluated in this study, 3 (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and CxCL10) were significantly diminished by RIS and another 2 (MIP1-\u03b2 and CxCL11) were dysregulated. Cytokines and chemokines reported to be elevated in COVID-19 patients include TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, INF\u03b3, CxCL10, CCL7, IL-1ra, CCL2, IL-1 \u03b1/\u03b2, MIP1-\u03b1, MIP1-\u03b2, IL-4, IL-10, and G-CSF (20) (21) . Of the 10 evaluated in this study, RIS significantly diminished 4 (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, INF\u03b3, CxCL10, and CCL2) and dysregulated 4 (IL-1ra, IL-1\u03b1, IL-4, and MIP1-\u03b2). Only IL-10 and G-CSF levels were not altered by RIS during challenge with TLR4 agonist LPS, indicating that COVID-19 responses may be highly impacted by this drug. Furthermore, failure of RIS-treated mice to respond to immunization against pneumococcal antigen is alarming given the increasing concern about secondary bacterial pneumonia, including pneumococcal pneumonia, during ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 (22) .",

RIS/ L VEH animals (n=6) weighed 25.8 +/-1.27g on day 1 and 27.4 +/-1.18 on the final day. RIS/LPS animals averaged 24.1 +/-0.59 g BW on day 1 and 25.6 +/-0.61 g on day last. The dose of LPS employed in this study is sub-lethal, and as expected, all animals survived LPS treatment. Plasma concentrations of RIS and PAL averaged 11.3 +/-1.7 and 47.9 +/-6.3 nM in RIS treated animals. No drug concentrations were detectable in samples from VEH treated animals. In the adaptive immune challenge study, average body weights on day 1 were 24.4 +/-0.59, 24.2 +/-1.17, 23.6 +/-0.76 and 23.9 +/-0.33 g for D VEH/ V VEH, D VEH/VAX, RIS/ V VEH and RIS/VAX animals, respectively (n=6 per treatment).
