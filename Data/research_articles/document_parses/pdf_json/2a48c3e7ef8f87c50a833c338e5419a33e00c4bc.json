            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a highly infectious virus associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Individuals may maintain high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract with significant potential for viral shedding and transmission even if they are asymptomatic. 4, 5 Although primarily transmitted by droplets, airborne transmission is possible through aerosolization in the setting of high-flow oxygen, bronchoscopy, open tracheal suctioning, intubation, extubation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, endoscopy, or transesophageal echocardiography. 6 As the prevalence of COVID-19 increases exponentially, patients presenting with seemingly nonrelated medical problems may expose healthcare providers to increased risk of contracting the disease if not properly protected. Such exposure puts electrophysiology staff, physicians, and other clinical personnel at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Reducing contact between healthcare personnel and patients who have COVID-19 is an integral step in limiting its spread and resource use, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).",

It may be reasonable to delay the following procedures for several weeks or months until the pandemic subsides and restrictions on elective procedures are lifted: confirmed COVID-19 requiring conscious sedation (which carries a risk for aerosolization with high-flow oxygen) or intubation. Close coordination between anesthesia and the electrophysiology laboratory teams is required. For general anesthesia cases, consideration should be given to elective intubation in the intensive care unit or a negative-pressure room before entering the electrophysiology laboratory. Because the care team is restricted to the laboratory or procedure room until the procedure has finished, staff should pay particular attention to having all supplies and equipment in the room at the start of the case. Consideration can also be given to performing procedures on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in a negative-pressure operating room. 12 It is important for hospitals to review the ventilation system of their electrophysiology laboratories to determine whether there is sharing of an air return that might require disinfection of other rooms. Where possible, procedure time should also be minimized. For example, among patients undergoing ventricular tachycardia ablation, extensive ventricular tachycardia induction and activation mapping may be minimized to reduce risk. Same-day discharges after device implantation should be considered to minimize the patient's risk of nosocomial infection. To minimize the transport of infected patients, direct-current or chemical cardioversions can be performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit with suitable anesthesia support. When feasible, patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection should be scheduled as the last case of the day, given the extensive cleaning required after the procedure. The CDC's recommendations for environmental cleaning and disinfection should be followed (see the link later in this article).",

Accordingly, it is critical to conserve valuable resources, such as PPE, medical, and ancillary staff, by minimizing routine patient health care that can be postponed in the short to intermediate term. Although hospitals in currently low-incidence geographies may feel confident of their capacity to handle elective procedures, current projections predict a spread of COVID-19 that is likely to overwhelm resources. Social distancing, limiting exposure of patients with COVID-19 infection to other patients and healthcare personnel, and access to testing regardless of the incidence of the infection are critically important steps. Patient education about these measures should be reinforced at every opportunity.",

In the current COVID-19 crisis, adoption of virtual medical services is rapidly increasing. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have expanded telehealth services to keep people safe and help healthcare providers focus on individuals who have the \"most dire health care needs.\" At the present time, telemedicine can be provided by phone and using several secure messaging applications and platforms. Physicians should familiarize themselves with the federal, state, and local policies/regulations and follow procedures at their own institutions. The Office for Civil Rights for the US Department of Health and Human Services recently released a notification of enforcement discretion for telehealth, and is allowing the use of any nonpublic facing audio or video communication product to provide telehealth during the COVID-19 crisis. To this end, the Office for Civil Rights has expressed willingness to forego penalties for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act noncompliance among providers enacting good-faith measures for telemedicine during the pandemic. 14 One unexpected outcome of the COVID-19 cloud may be advancement of digital health methodology and practices that leverage smart phones, video conferencing systems, wearables, and remote monitoring.",

Although we are not recommending any specific treatment, safety guidance for clinicians using hydroxychloroquine may be requested of electrophysiology providers. Hydroxychloroquine is known to block Kv11.1 (HERG) and can cause drug-induced long QT. 15 The clinical arrhythmic toxicity (syncope and torsade de pointes) is largely limited to chronic use (because of its long half-life of 40 days), use of multiple concomitant QT-prolonging medications (eg, azithromycin), metabolic derangements, renal failure, or in the setting of an acute overdose. 16, 17 To date, it has been widely tolerated in most populations as an antimalarial and has been safely used in the rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus populations without ECG monitoring. 18 Because the proposed hydroxychloroquine therapy for COVID-19 is relatively short (eg, 5-10 days), the risk of arrhythmic toxicity is likely quite low. However, there are specific precautions to be considered for select patients, however: One has responsibility to self, family, patients, other healthcare professionals and to be a good steward for resource conservation. COVID-19 indicates coronavirus disease 2019; and PPE, personal protection equipment. \u2022 Patients with known congenital long-QT syndrome \u2022 Patients with severe renal insufficiency should have the dose reduced (50% for CrCl <10 mL/min) \u2022 Patients on QT-prolonging drugs \u2022 Electrolyte imbalances (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) must be corrected before use, with regular monitoring None of these conditions is an absolute contraindication if use of hydroxychloroquine is warranted. It is reasonable to temporarily stop class III antiarrhythmic drugs, with use of a reasonable alternative if there is evidence of QT prolongation. It is important to note that aggressive electrolyte correction can mitigate arrhythmic toxicity. ECG monitoring should be considered for patients on multiple QT-prolonging medications and avoidance or careful monitoring may be required for patients with congenital long-QT syndrome. Additional guidance for navigating and circumventing the QTc-prolonging and torsadogenic potential of pharmacotherapies for CO-VID-19 has been recently published. 19 ",
