There are suggestions that BCG may enhance antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [21, 22] . RC should be considered in patients at low risk of COVID-19 mortality and with highrisk disease features, for example, presence of high-grade pT1 plus Tis, or tumors with lympho(vascular) invasion, variant histology (eg, micropapillary disease), residual grade 3/highgrade urothelial carcinoma on re-resection, or pT1 stage [23] [24] [25] .

We urge caution and highlight the importance of the TURBT specifically in these highrisk patients [28] . In patients with high-grade NMIBC, induction BCG and one course of maintenance therapy (6 + 3) should be offered as first-line therapy.
