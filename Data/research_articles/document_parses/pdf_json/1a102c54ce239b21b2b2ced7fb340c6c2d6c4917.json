Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments that have been approved after clinical trials. Social distancing measures, including travel bans, school closure, and quarantine applied to countries or regions are being used to limit the spread of the disease, and the demand on the healthcare infrastructure. The seclusion of groups and individuals has led to limited access to accurate information. To update the public, especially in South Africa, announcements are made by the minister of health daily. These announcements narrate the confirmed COVID-19 cases and include the age, gender, and travel history of people who have tested positive for the disease. Additionally, the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases updates a daily infographic summarising the number of tests performed, confirmed cases, mortality rate, and the regions affected. However, the age of the patient and other nuanced data regarding the transmission is only shared in the daily announcements and not on the updated infographic. To disseminate this information, the Data Science for Social Impact research group at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, has worked on curating and applying publicly available data in a way that is computer readable so that information can be shared to the public -using both a data repository and a dashboard.. Through collaborative practices, a variety of challenges related to publicly available data in South Africa came to the fore. These include shortcomings in the accessibility, integrity, and data management practices between governmental departments and the South African public. In this paper, solutions to these problems will be shared by using a publicly available data repository and dashboard as a case study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Accurate data are at the centre of mitigating risk, preventing widespread panic and sensationalism during a natural disaster.

During a crisis, the public needs to minimize exposure to the situation or act accordingly to provide support where needed. The contribution of this paper is a framework that substantiates the type of data employed to capture and modify shared information with the public during a crisis of a biological nature, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first reported case of COVID-19 was in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [? ] . The problem with SARS-CoV-2 is the pressure it puts on the healthcare system because of its high infection rate [13] . Globally, sudden spikes in the confirmed COVID-19 cases are severe because there are limited resources to effectively manage and treat patients in any of the current healthcare systems [3] . As of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic-one of the first biological threats to modern society in the 21st century. [11] . In order for the South African government to reduce the widespread of SARS-CoV-2, travelling restrictions were placed on high-risk regions and border-crossings were closed from one country to another. South Africa experienced the first COVID-19 case on the 28th of February 2020, and as of the 25th of March 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 702, despite efforts to contain the virus by putting a ban on international travel [10] .

Firstly, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) publishes an infographic that contains limited information, providing a bird's-eye view of the outbreak. This information is limited to South Africa and only reports the number of tests performed, number of confirmed cases, which regions are affected, and COVID-19 related mortality [9] . Secondly, the minister of the Department of Health (DoH) in South Africa, Zwelini Mkhize, updates the public regarding the cases as they arise on a daily basis. These updates are published sentences on the DoH website, containing some demographic information about the confirmed cases, including age, gender, travel history and mode of contraction of SARS-CoV-2 [2] . Although these sources of information are valuable, they are potentially ineffective ways of sharing information to the public regarding their usability for a variety of reasons. Amongst these is the number of different platforms a person has to navigate through to gain access to accurate data. Additionally, the format in which the data are presented is not in a computer readable format and has to undergo processing in order to be used and stored. This further complicates legibility, simplicity and accessibility of the information that is shared, a concern about South African government data that was highlighted in prior work [8] .
