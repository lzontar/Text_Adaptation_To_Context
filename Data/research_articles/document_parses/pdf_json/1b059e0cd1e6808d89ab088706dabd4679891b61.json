[1] As of February4 th 2020, there have been more than 20 000 diagnosed cases and 426 confirmed deaths (Xinhua News). As the pathogenesis of this virus is yet to be understood,t here are few treatment options available to healthcare professionals who are fighting this epidemic at the front line. Praise needs to be given to Chinese researchers who have acted quickly to isolate and sequence the virus. The availability of the virus genome sequence (GenBankI D: MN908947.3) makesi tpossible to identify treatments.A lthough it is essential to develop vaccines, small molecules, and biological therapeutics to specifically target the 2019-nCoV virus, it is unlikely that any effort made at the moment will benefitp atients in the current outbreak. However,2 019-nCoV shares 82 %s equence identityw ith severe acuter espiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV,G enBank ID:N C_004718.3) and more than 90 %s equence identityins everalessential enzymes( see figures below). Therefore, what we have learnedf rom several medicinal chemistry studies on SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syn-drome (MERS-CoV) mayb ed irectly used to help us treat 2019-nCoV.C oV relies on its spike proteins to bind ah ost cell-surface receptor fore ntry ( Figure 1 ). [2] For 2019-nCoV,i ti se vident that this receptor is angiotensin-converting enzyme2(ACE2). [3] After the virus' entry into the host cell, its positive genomic RNA attaches directly to the hostr ibosome for the translation of two large, coterminal polyproteins that are processed by proteolysis into components for packaging new virions. [4] Two proteases that participate in this proteolysis process are the coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro) andt he papain-like protease (PLpro). [5] In order to replicate the RNA genome, the CoV encodes ar eplicase that is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). [6] These four proteins are essentialf or the pathogen. Therapeutics currently targeting spike, RdRp, 3CLpro, and PLpro are possible treatments for 2019-nCoV.I nt his viewpoint, we shall analyze similarities in spike, RdRp, 3CLpro, and PLpro proteins between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV,a nd suggest possible prevention and treatment options. Most compounds discussedw ill be experimental compounds and drug candidates; for ar eview of repurposed drugs for treating coronaviruses and other viruses,s ee Li et al. [7] As little is known so far about the virulence of this virus, we shall also discuss the interactions between spike and ACE2 that might challenget he current view that 2019-nCoV is less virulent than SARS-CoV owing to weaker interactions between spike and ACE2.",

The alignment of the RBD from the two origins shows 73.5 %s equence identity ( Figure 2A ). However, many nonconserved mutationst hat interactd irectly with ACE2 have accumulated in the two structuralregions (1 and 2inF igure 2B). [2] Both crystal and cryo-EMs tructures of the SARS-CoV spike-ACE2 complex (PDB IDs:2 AJF and 6ACD) have showed that only regions 1a nd 2e ngage in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with ACE2. As many residues in these two regions have been replaced in 2019-nCoV,t his will lead to al oss of some of these interactions. It has also been predicted that the 2019-nCoV RBD interactsw ith ACE2 more weakly than the SARS-CoV RBD. [3] However,b oth regions are highly looped structures. Large variations in the two regions will inevitably lead to structural rearrangements that potentiate novel and possibly even strongeri nteractions with ACE2. For region 2, there is almost no similarity in the sequence between the two virus origins;however,i tispremature to presume that the protein will fold in the same way to interact with ACE2. Assuming that region 2o f2 019-nCoV folds in the same way as that in SARS-CoV,F486 will be placed right at the position that engages in strong hydrophobic interactions with both L79 and M82 in ACE2 ( Figure 2C ). These interactions do not exist in the SARS RBD-ACE2 complex due to the significantly smaller L472 in that position.A nother residue that potentially engages in strong hydrogen-bonding interactions is Q474, which is at the correct distance to engage ar earranged Q24 in ACE2 (Figure 2C ). In region 1, the criticalr esidue Y484 in SARS-CoV is replaced by Q498 in 2019-nCoV.H owever,P 499, ap roline that is ak nowns econdary-structure disruptor,i se xpected to lead to as tructuralr earrangemento fr egion 1i nt he SARS-CoV RBD. In combination with Q498 and N501, new hydrogen-bonding interactions that might involve K353 and other residues in ACE2 could form ( Figure 2D ). Another notable difference between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV in the RBD is K417(2019-nCoV)/ V404(SARS-CoV). Thisi saresidue in the middle of the concave RBD binding surface that involves no interaction between SARS-CoV andA CE2. However,t he long, positively charged K417 couldp otentially engage in strong hydrogen bonding and salt-bridge interactions with H34 and D30, respectively,i n ACE2 ( Figure 2E ). Although molecular simulation may be used to analyze all thesep ossible interactions in detail,u ncertainty about them will persist until the structure of the 2019-nCoV-RBD-ACE2 complex is determined by crystallography or cryo-EM. Given the urgency of the matter,t here mustb em ultiple research groups working on this. We hope to see their results within as hort time. Alternatively, the 2019-nCoV RBD could be expressed, and its affinity toward ACE2 could be independently determined biochemically and compared with that of the SARS-CoV RBD. Before any solid experimental resultsa re available, any claimsa bout the weaker bindingo ft he 2019-nCoV RBD towardA CE2 than that of the SARS-CoV RBD is premature.",

The development of SARS vaccines based on the spike protein has been summarized in several previous reviews. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Severals trategies including live-attenuated SARS-CoV,k illed SARS-CoV,D NA vaccinesa nd viral vectored vaccines have been successfully used to vaccinate against animal SARS-CoVs. [8, 13, 14] Similar ideas could be applied in de-veloping2 019-nCoV vaccines. Alternative approaches are to directly use the 2019-nCoV RBD in combination with immunitypromoting adjuvants as av accine to trigger the human body to develop antibodies for the 2019-nCoV RBD, thereby neutralizing the virus. [15] Although there are published resultsa bout therapeutic antibodiesa nd peptides developed to neutralize the SARS-CoV spike protein, they are expectedt oh ave little use in neutralizing 2019-nCoV.A sd iscussed above, the two engaging regions in the spike RBD for bindingA CE2 are very different between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV.A ntibodies and peptides targeting two regions in the SARS-CoV RBD are expected to interact weaklyw itht he 2019-nCoV RBD. Novel antibodies and therapeutic peptides that interact potently with the 2019-nCoV RBD can be used to block its interaction with ACE2.S everalr esearch groups,i ncluding ours, have developed methods for building macrocyclic peptidel ibrariesa nd applyingt hem to the quick identification of macrocyclic peptide ligandsf or drug targets. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Application of these libraries to search for potent ligandsfor the 2019-nCoV RBD or the two ACE2-engaging peptide regions will potentially lead to rapid discovery of anti-2019-nCoV macrocyclic peptides. Although our group has initiated this effort, the lengthy drug-discovery process will not make it possible to help patients in the current epidemic in this way.Learning from the study of SARS-CoV,apossible alternative is the direct use of peptides derived from the 2019-nCoV RBD and ACE2. Peptides derived from both the SARS-CoV RBD and ACE2 have been developed as novel therapeutics against SARS-CoV infection by blockingS ARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 binding. For example, ap eptide that overlaps the RBD sequence(aa 471-503) can specifically block the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV RBD and inhibitt he entry of SARS-CoV into Vero cellsw itha nI C 50 of 41.6 mm. [22] Onep eptide comprising two ACE2 motifs (aa 22-44a nd 351-357) linked by glycine exhibited potent anti-SARS activity with an IC 50 value of 0.1 mm. [23] Before any potent therapeutics to neutralize the 2019-nCoV RBD-ACE2 interaction are available, ap ossible quick solution to blockingt his interaction is to use 2019-nCoV RBD-based peptides and cocktails thereof.",

            "text": "Although 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV share 82 %s equence identity at their genomic RNA level, their RdRp proteins share a remarkable 96 %s equence identity ( Figure 3A ). RdRp involves av ery large and deepg roove as an active site for the polymerization of RNA. Residues that show variations between the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RdRps are mostly distal to this active site ( Figure 3B ). [24] This high sequence conservation between the two enzymes makesi tv ery likelyt hat any potent agents developed for the SARS-CoV RdRp will exhibit equal potency and efficacy on the 2019-nCoV RdRp. Although not extensively ChemBioChem 2020, 21,730 -738 www.chembiochem.org explored,s everala gentse xist that target the SARS-CoV RdRp or its catalyzed polymerization process. One such compound found to show antiviral activity was aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA ;F igure 4). ATAi sa na nionic polymer shown to bind to a variety of protein targets, including gp120o fH IV-1 and HIV-2, that has been demonstrated to prevent SARS-CoV replication (IC 50 = 0.2 mg mL \u00c01 ). [25] [26] [27] Despite computational modelsv alidated against known ATAt argets predicting RdRp as the bound target, no experimental evidence has demonstrated this relationship. [28] Beyond this exception,t he remainingR dRp inhibitors have been nucleoside analogues,a nd these provide the most promisinga venue towards disrupting viral RNA replication. The nucleoside analogue ribavirin (RBV,F igure 4) has been tested against SARS-CoV,and in SARS-and MERS-infected patients. [29] [30] [31] [32] At best, efficacy with RBV was inconclusive, with some studies showing aw orsening of patient outcomes (as reviewed by Stockman, et al.). [33] Exonuclease activity by the enzyme nsp14 has been shown to be able to remove mismatches as well as incorporated nucleoside analogues, and inactivation of nsp14'se xonuclease activity has been shown to www.chembiochem.org increaset he efficacy of nucleosides like RBV. [32, 34] In order to develop nucleoside analogues to effectively inhibit viral RNA replication, the nucleoside must either evade detection by the exonuclease or must outcompete exonuclease activity.R emdesivir (GS-5734) is an excellent example of the latter.A na denosine analogue prodrug with a1 '-nitrile, it displayed potent efficacy against SARS and MERS in human airway epithelial (HAE) cell models and in mice (IC 50 = 0.069 and 0.074 mm for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,r espectively,i nH AE). [35] Broad-spectrum activity against various bat coronaviruses was also demonstrated. [35] The susceptibility of CoV to remdesivir was shown to be increased in strains with inactivated exonuclease activity. [36] CoV resistance to remdesivir was studied in the model b-coronavirus, murine hepatitisv irus (MHV). MHV passaged in the presenceo ft he parent nucleoside, GS-441524 (which contains a5 '-hydroxy group instead of ap hosphoramidate), developed two mutations in the RdRp, F476L and V553L. These mutations conferred a5 .6-fold increasei nr esistance to remdesivir in MHV and as ixfold increase in resistance when the homologous mutations were introduced to the RdRp of SARS-CoV (0.01 vs. 0.06 mm). Mice infected with this resistantS ARS-CoV had significantly lower lung viral titers 4days post-infection. [36] Altogether,r emdesivirh as been shown to outcompetet he proofreading ability of nsp12, and mutations that confer resistance at-tenuate virulence. Efforts towardsd rugging coronavirus in a RdRp manner should provide ab asis not only to develop therapeuticsf or 2019-nCoV,b ut could provide broad-spectrum antiviralsuseful for future CoV outbreaks. 3CLpro and PLpro 3CLpro and PLpro are two proteases that process the polypeptide translation product from the genomic RNA into the structural and nonstructural protein componentsv ital for the replication and packaging of an ew generation of viruses. PLpro also serves as ad eubiquitinase that functions to deubiquitylate host cell proteins such as interferon regulatory factor 3( IRF3) as well as to inactivate the pathway for nuclear factor k-lightchain-enhancer of activated Bcells( NF-kB). [37] This leads to immune suppressioni nt he cells of the host being infected by the virus. Because both proteases are vital to the virus for replication and controlling the host cell, they are viable targets for antiviral agents. Similart ot he RdRp protein, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV share ar emarkable 96 %s equence identity in their decoded 3CLpro( Figure 5A ). 3CLpro naturally forms ad imer, and each monomer containst wo regions:t he N-terminal catalytic region and the C-terminal region ( Figure 5B ).
