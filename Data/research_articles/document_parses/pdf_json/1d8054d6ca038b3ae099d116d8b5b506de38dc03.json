            "text": "Up to 4 February 2020, over 20 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection have been reported in China, of which more than 60 % are in Wuhan city and Hubei province. Patients may display a wide range of symptoms, while others are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms after becoming infected [1, 2] . Although fever, fatigue, and dry cough are the most common symptoms, diarrhea has been observed as the first symptom in many young patients, while abdominal discomfort and poor appetite are shown in elderly patients. Our data have shown that more than 50 % of patients with confirmed or suspected infection present with diarrhea (16/28). The transmission rate indicated by reproductive number (Ro) is 4.08 according to a recent study [3] . The total mortality rate of 2019-nCoV pneumonia is only 2 %, according to the analysis of public data. However, the mortality rate of severe cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia has been between 10 % and 40 % on different days of the outbreak in Wuhan. As the Chinese Spring Festival holiday comes to an end, most endoscopy centers in China will reopen to patients who need endoscopic operations. 2019-nCoV has been described to be transmitted from respiratory secretions, feces, and contaminated environmental surfaces [1, 4] . In addition, the virus is spread not only by patients with symptoms but also by asymptomatic individuals [2] . Due to the inevitable exposure to respiratory secretions during upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and exposure to feces during colonoscopy, all individuals in the endoscopy center are at high risk of exposure to the virus, especially the staff in the operating room. To prevent 2019-nCoV transmission in the endoscopy center, we offer the following summary and recommendations for infection prevention and control in digestive endoscopy during the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV according to the epidemiological characteristics we have observed, combined with past experience and the literature (\u25b6 Fig. 1 )",

Identification of patients with potential 2019-nCoV infection is the first critical step in prevention and infection control. Chest computed tomography (CT) is the most reliable approach based on our experiences, as some patients have no clinical manifestations or display only slight digestive tract symptoms; CT scans can reveal interstitial pneumonia in the outer zone of one or both lungs. Moreover, we found that CT manifestations may appear earlier than nucleic acid detection, and in a few patients with epidemiological history, typical chest CT manifestations, and typical clinical outcome of 2019-nCov pneumonia, the viral pneumonia etiologies in the local regionincluding 2019-nCov etiol-ogy detectionare all negative. Therefore, we believe that CT examination of the lung is faster and more effective than etiological examination for screening of 2019 nCov pneumonia. Compared with other kinds of viral pneumonia, the family aggregation of 2019-nCov pneumonia is more obvious. The following workflow is recommended for all endoscopy centers in China based on the current 2019-nCoV pneumonia outbreakinWuhan,Hubeiprovince,China.",

Any member of staff showing fever, fatigue, and dry cough, or who has had contact with a 2019-nCoVinfected patient should be identified and treated appropriately. 2. Compulsory temperature checks should be performed for everyone every day before entering the work area. 3. Hand hygiene: staff are required to wash their hands following the \"sixstep hand-washing method\" or to clean hands with quick-drying hand sanitizer for 2 minutes. 4. Protection at biosafety level 2 is required for staff who are in direct contact with patients, such as wearing disposable gowns, N95 masks, goggles, caps, and shoe covers during the operation. 5. Protection at biosafety level 3 is required when performing tracheal intubation, airway care, and sputum suction in patients without 2019-nCoV. 6.
