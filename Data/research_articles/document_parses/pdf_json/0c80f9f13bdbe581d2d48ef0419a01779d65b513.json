For upper GI bleeding, common reasons were esophageal variceal hemorrhage and peptic ulcer, whereas for lower GI bleeding, common reasons were diverticular bleeding and tumor. In most cases (104/109), endoscopy yielded a diagnosis. All endoscopic interventions were successful without complications. There was no suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 among these patients, and no nosocomial infection occurred.",

When contacting afebrile and patients unsuspected with COVID-19, medical staff should wear a surgical mask or N95 mask (according to local availability), cap, disposable waterproof gown, gloves, shoe covers, and goggles/face shield. During ERCP, enteral stenting, or contacting febrile patients, isolation screens could be used to provide further protection against splashing ( Figure 2 ). Procedures for suspected COVID-19 cases should be performed in endoscopy rooms with negative pressure. In institutions without necessary criteria, avoid performing endoscopy in suspected patients and transfer patients to other institutions, except for inevitable situations. Procedures for confirmed COVID-19 cases should be performed in designated institutions with centralized treatment of COVID-19. During this pandemic, we avoid unnecessary anesthesia to decrease exposure of anesthesiologists. If intravenous anesthesia is needed, the anesthesiologists should wear proper personal protective equipment with goggles or face shield. If intubation is needed, anesthesiologists should wear N95 masks, and only the anesthesiologist stays in the room during intubation, whereas the rest of the team remains outside until intubation is finished. In institutions performing physician-based sedated endoscopy, physicians should be protected accordingly.",

During anesthesia, oxygen mask should be put outside the surgical mask. For patients receiving gastroscopy or ERCP, a special disposable device combing the bite block and oxygen mask (Figure 3 ) is provided to prevent respiratory droplets from spreading. During the procedure, verbal communication should be minimized. Caution should be taken to avoid the biopsy channel facing the operator's face. During this pandemic, endoscopic treatment aims to solve the critical and life-threatening conditions and to minimize cross-infection to the largest extent. For example, when ERCP is performed for choledocholithiasis with acute cholangitis, only biliary drainage with plastic stent or nasobiliary tube should be recommended instead of aiming for complete stone removal.",

Instead, for a careful trade-off between potential risk of nosocomial infection and saving life-threatening conditions, selection of indications for necessary endoscopy cannot be overemphasized. During the pandemic, strict epidemiological survey and differential diagnosis of fever is crucial. With appropriate protection, necessary endoscopic procedures are safe and effective. A clear work flow will be helpful for the performance of safe and effective endoscopy.",
