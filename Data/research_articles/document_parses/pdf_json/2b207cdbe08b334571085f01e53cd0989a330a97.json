The exosomal release serves as a disposal pathway alternative to the lysosome. 24 In addition to this, exosomes are thought to functionally mediate cell-to-cell communication under normal and pathological conditions by transferring active proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and small non-coding RNAs stably in various biofluids 25, 26 and play important roles in metabolic regulation pathways. 27 Especially stem-cell-secreted exosomes are considered to be organ protective by modulating the immune function of the recipient cells 28 or by stimulating the repair of recipient cells. [29] [30] [31] A recent proteomics study indicated that T-cadherin is one of the most abundantly expressed proteins on the cell surface of MSCs. 32 In our previous studies, we developed a new one-step purification method of the clinically important multimer adiponectin from serum 11 and demonstrated that the use of adiponectin obtained through this procedure enhances exosome biogenesis and secretion. 27, 33 Furthermore, the systemic levels of exosome in the peripheral blood decreased by genetic loss of adiponectin and increased by overexpression of adiponectin in vivo. 27, 33 Adiponectin increased exosome biogenesis.

We examined T-cadherin protein expression and accumulation of adiponectin in hMSCs (Figure 1B , WCL [whole-cell lysate]). Western blot analysis confirmed that hMSCs express T-cadherin, as reported previously, 32 and accumulate HMW-APN purified from mouse serum following 48-h incubation ( Figure 1B, WCL) . 11 Next, we tested whether adiponectin enhanced exosome production from hMSCs ( Figure 1B , Exosome).

To determine the amount of exosome specifically produced by hMSCs transplanted in vivo, we developed a new method to detect hMSC-derived exosomes specifically from blood circulation in mice. Gaussia luciferase fused with MFG-E8 (gLuc-MFG-E8) was successfully used to label exosomes in vitro and to monitor labeled exosomes in the circulation using small volumes of plasma. 39, 40 We exploited this technique to label exosomes produced by the transplanted hMSCs by introducing gLuc-MFG-E8 cDNA into hMSCs (Figures 2D and 2E). Exosome-associated gLuc activity was successfully monitored during the time course study following intravenous injection of gLuc-MFG-E8-expressing hMSCs ( Figure 2E ). The activity increased with injection of higher cell numbers and gradually decreased within 3 days ( Figure 2G ). Since exosome-associated gLuc activity in adenovirus-infected cells was in parallel with the growth of hMSCs during 72-h culture after infection in vitro ( Figure S1 ), it is likely that the observed in vivo change in the exosomes is not due to loss of gLuc-MFG-E8 gene expression in hMSCs but rather to the decrease in viability or exosome production by hMSCs. In addition, the increase of circulating exosomes by the hMSCs was also detected by western blot analysis of exosome fractions obtained by ultracentrifugation using exosome marker antibodies ( Figure 2G ). Exosome markers, such as ALG-2 interacting protein (Alix) and Tsg101 (antibodies of these can detect both human and mouse proteins), also significantly increased following hMSC injection ( Figure 2G ).
