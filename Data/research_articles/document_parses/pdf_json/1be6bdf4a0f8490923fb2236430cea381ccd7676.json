Generally, this logical connective provides a solution lower than or equal to the MAX operator, and higher than or equal to the projection of the full alternative, i.e., the solution does not go below any averaging function and above MAX function. Therefore, the optional alternative does not influence the solution when it is satisfied with a degree lower than the degree of full alternative.

The full substitutability means that at least one predicate should be met [7] . In technical systems, it is a desirable property, because if one unit fails, the others substitute its functionality. But, in evaluating records from a large data set, a larger number of records might be selected and moreover a significant proportion of them might get the ideal evaluation score. An example is searching for a house which has spacious basement or spacious attic or suitable tool-shed for storing the less-frequently used items. Such query might lead to the over-abundant answer problem. This problem was discussed in [3] , where several solutions have been proposed. People often consider disjunction as the left-right order of predicates (alternatives), that is, the first predicate is the full alternative, whereas the other ones are less relevant options [10, 13] , or formally P 1 OR ELSE P 2 OR ELSE P 3 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 181, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 718, "end": 721, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 959, "end": 963, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 964, "end": 967, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In the above example, predicates might not be the equal substitutes for a particular house buyer.

This observation leads to the intensified disjunction. The literature offers two approaches: bipolar and asymmetric.
