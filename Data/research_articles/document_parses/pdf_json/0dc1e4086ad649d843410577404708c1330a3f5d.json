We compared the results of two methods and explored how they worked to characterize the 2018 influenza season performance-2018 season. Methods: Historical data from the 2005/2006 to 2016/2018 influenza season performance seasons were provided by a network of 412 primary health centers in charge of influenza like illness (ILI) sentinel surveillance. We used the WHO averages and the moving epidemic method (MEM) to evaluate the proportion of ILI visits among all outpatient consultations (ILI%) as a proxy for influenza activity. We also used the MEM method to evaluate three seasons of composite data (ILI% multiplied by percent of ILI with laboratory-confirmed influenza) as recommended by WHO. Results: The WHO method estimated the seasonal ILI% threshold at 0.9%. The annual epidemic period began on average at week 46 and lasted an average of 18 weeks. The MEM model estimated the epidemic threshold (corresponding to the WHO seasonal threshold) at 1.5% of ILI visits among all outpatient consultations. The annual epidemic period began on week 49 and lasted on average 14 weeks. Intensity thresholds were similar using both methods. When using the composite measure, the MEM method showed a clearer estimate of the beginning of the influenza epidemic, which was coincident with a sharp increase in confirmed ILI cases. Conclusions: We found that the threshold methodology presented in the WHO manual is simple to implement and easy to adopt for use by the Moroccan influenza surveillance system. The MEM method is more statistically sophisticated and may allow a better detection of the start of seasonal epidemics.

The influenza-associated respiratory annual mortality rate for people aged 65 and older in Morocco has been recently estimated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) at 3.7 per 100,000 (95% Credible Interval of 0. 4-22. 3) [1] . The risk of hospitalization due to influenza is 5 to 10 times greater in high-risk populations in Morocco (e.g., the elderly and people with chronic disease) than in the general population [3] . The most effective ways to prevent or mitigate these effects are through vaccination combined with appropriate clinical management of persons infected with influenza. Optimal impact of vaccination campaigns is achieved by timing them prior to the beginning of the influenza season to ensure maximum coverage and protection among the population.

Member States are encouraged to establish influenza baseline and epidemic alert thresholds from surveillance data and to monitor and describe the severity of each influenza season (seasonal, epidemic or pandemic influenza) using these thresholds. For this purpose, a simple method proposed by the WHO was used [22, 29, 30] . WHO is now recommending MEM, which is a more sophisticated method of reporting influenza activity adopted by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [31] [32] [33] [34] and adopted by several countries from other regions [35, 36] . The analysis using the MEM application with 11 seasons of syndromic surveillance data showed clear seasonality to ILI activity and visual inspection of graphed data revealed a single seasonal peak per year. The data show seasonal peaks between December and March, varying by year, as described by Barakat et al. based on visual analysis [18] , matching trends observed in other northern hemisphere countries [37] . The average seasonal peak in Morocco occurs at week 3 (mid-January) using either method. The seasonal threshold established using the method described in the WHO influenza surveillance guidelines was lower than the epidemic threshold calculated by the MEM method when ILI proportions are considered (0.9% versus 1.51% of ILI patients among all outpatients). The average epidemic start week was estimated to be earlier when using the WHO method, with an average start at week 46 versus week 49 or 50 by using respectively ILI proportions or the composite parameter with the MEM method. There is a three-to four-week difference between these 2 methods when describing the typical start to a season; the optimal timing of a seasonal influenza vaccination campaign might vary accordingly. Public health officials must weigh the costs and benefits of the optimal campaign period. Influenza vaccine administration is ideally timed at least several weeks prior to influenza virus circulation as antibody response is achieved on average 2 weeks post vaccination [38] . The average epidemic period estimated by the WHO method was longer compared with the MEM method (24 weeks vs. 14 or 15 weeks respectively). There are few publications with estimates of the typical duration of an influenza season [37] . According to the available evidence, the duration of the influenza season in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, ranges 12-19 weeks in Europe [39] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 316, "end": 320, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 646, "end": 650, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 651, "end": 654, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 655, "end": 658, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 825, "end": 829, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 830, "end": 834, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 835, "end": 839, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 840, "end": 844, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 897, "end": 901, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 902, "end": 905, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1219, "text": "Barakat et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1249, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1320, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2377, "end": 2381, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2613, "end": 2617, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2773, "end": 2777, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The goodness-of-fit calculations from the MEM application indicate that the MEM capacity for detecting epidemic activity had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 92% when using ILI proportions, implying that it is better for eliminating false signals than it is for detecting a true signal. Our finding is similar to that of Vega et al., who also found the sensitivity to be significantly lower than the specificity [27] . Using Cambodian surveillance data, Ly et al. [30] also found that the WHO methodology appeared to have a higher sensitivity for detecting early epidemic activity, but a lower specificity than MEM, implying a greater risk of signalling false starts to the season. Timely detection of the start of seasonal epidemics may be important to alert health services and to mitigate morbidity, mortality and economic costs by allowing resource allocation and adjusting response measures to face the seasonal overload in the healthcare system. The public health implications for this difference between methodologies are that using the MEM method without applying the seasonal threshold established using the WHO method, there is a risk of missing the beginning of the epidemic period and not providing timely guidance to clinicians to indicate influenza season has begun, and to manage patient treatment accordingly. Using the lower WHO threshold for public health messaging regarding the beginning of the influenza season may pose the risk of a false alert and perhaps overprescribing antiviral medications. From another point of view, using a low seasonal threshold could influence decision-makers to recommend earlier vaccination. As our results showed that the seasonal threshold typically occurs between mid-November and mid-December in Morocco, appropriate timing for vaccination could be about 1 month before this date. Of note, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that vaccination should be offered by the end of October, considering the unpredictability of timing of onset of the influenza season and concerns that vaccineinduced immunity might wane over the course of a season [40] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 421, "end": 425, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2139, "end": 2143, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Low seasonal thresholds may be crossed multiple times as was the case in our application of the WHO threshold for several seasons (2005/2006, 2006/2007, 2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2013/2014 [not shown]), due perhaps to variability in reporting by the surveillance sites. Because of this variability, it is possible that declaring the start of the influenza season after two or three sustained weeks of activity above the threshold as recommended by WHO, is a prudent option for considering influenza transmission as epidemic.

It is obvious that the inclusion of virologic data increases the specificity of seasonal threshold estimation. According to the WHO guidelines [5] , \"a combination of parameters may be preferable.
