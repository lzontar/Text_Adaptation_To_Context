They are highly experienced in advocacy and education, and are experts at managing the frail, multi-morbid, chronically or acutely critically unwell patient: the very cohort most at risk of severe COVID-19 related illness is the core SPCS patient population. There remains a mandate to provide quality healthcare to those following a palliative approach in the management of all other conditions, and SPCS are well positioned to provide guidance on how this might be achieved when access and models of care may need to rapidly change. There is an opportunity to present perspective, collective wisdom and clinical skill in addressing the challenges faced, to minimise suffering, and to support the wider healthcare teams less-experienced in providing palliative care.",

Current focus in many health care systems relates to surge preparation and ensuring hospitals are adequately resourced for an influx of critically unwell patients with COVID-19 related illness. Triaging systems mean that in some cases only those with the greatest chance of recovery are eligible for life-sustaining treatment, and it is crucial that there is an equally robust plan for supportive management of those patients outside this cohort, as well as ensuring the needs of those outside the hospital system are still met. SPCS are experts in advocacy and balancing ethical considerations, experienced in decision-making in the face of uncertainty, and should be central in planning. They also have a role in guiding other clinicians in decision-making regarding individualised management, impeccable symptom control, and care of the dying and their loved ones.",
