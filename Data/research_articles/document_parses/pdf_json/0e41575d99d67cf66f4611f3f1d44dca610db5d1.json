Stochastic population data cause oscillations to be sustained rather than damped, and data analysis regarding the oscillations provides insights into the same set of population data. Notably, oscillations arise naturally from the model, instead of from a periodic forcing term or other exogenous mechanism that guarantees oscillation: the model has no such mechanism. These emergent natural oscillations display appropriate periodicity for smallpox, even when the model is applied to different locations and populations. The model and datasets, in turn, offer new observations about disease dynamics and solution trajectories.

These modeller-selected features permit fine-tuned adjustment of oscillations for the purpose of matching a dataset, and periodic forcing terms, in particular, can permit the teasing apart of different contributors to disease incidence. Still, a chicken-and-egg question must be asked: should observed oscillations in the data cause us to construct a model in which periodic behaviour is guaranteed, or should a model written without the expectation of periodicity be permitted to display oscillation, or not, depending on its parameter values and underlying demographics? More questions closely follow: what can we learn from sustained oscillations in a very simple model? What is the role of historical data in determining model parameters?

In particular, the dataset for Hida is 81 years, the dataset for British India is 51 years, and the dataset for Sweden spans only 26 years. Further advantageous for Hida is that it is a relatively small and homogeneous population in a small geographical region. For these reasons, the Hida dataset appears to best lend itself toward this analysis. Hida's peaks of smallpox incidence are clearest, rising the most in comparison with nonpeak years and spanning just one to two calendar years. For contrast, while oscillation is noticeable in the British India and Sweden datasets, it is yet true that smallpox incidence in those regions encompasses a much larger geographical area, so that outbreaks spread spatially and therefore take up multiple years apiece. This smooths and spreads out some of the effects of oscillation.

By using simple models to emphasize the connections between data and mathematical properties such as oscillation, we can thus highlight historical data points of interest for further study.

This further suggests that the underlying dynamical mechanisms in disease outbreaks can be captured well by simple SIR models. Meanwhile, datasets from historical outbreaks worldwide have become widely available for study. We, therefore, call for a renewed interest in relatively simple mathematical models, in conjunction with data from real outbreaks.
