However, some open questions still remain on teledermatology: are clinical photos and videos really valid substitutes for accurate clinical evaluation of skin diseases we cannot see directly live? How many patients and / or doctors are actually familiar with the necessary devices? When teledermatology was born, in the absence of restrictions, it was seen as an aid tool in triaging, diagnosing, and managing many dermatologic conditions, ranging from inflammatory to neoplastic diseases (3). Recent review on teledermatology, conducted in normal, non-emergency settings, have demonstrated comparable results between the live-interactive and the traditional live in person care, in terms of feasibility and accuracy. The evidence to date supports both its diagnostic and treatment accuracy and its cost effectiveness (7). However, there is a high risk of neglect and medical error for dermatologist if photos, videos or images are unclear or misleading. Moreover, the patient could risk providing incomplete information, leaving out details relevant to diagnosis, which would not have escaped the dermatologist if he had performed a live physical examination. During pandemic emergency, patients and doctors may not have adequate available devices and software or may not be sufficiently confident in their use.",
