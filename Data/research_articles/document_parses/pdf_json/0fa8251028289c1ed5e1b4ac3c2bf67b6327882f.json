These findings have been widely interpreted in the context of the \u00d4hygiene hypo-thesis\u00d5 which, in its broadest form, posits that natural exposure to microbial stimulation (both commensals and pathogens) provides obligatory signals required to drive the postnatal maturation of adaptive immune functions (7) . The cellular targets for these microbial stimuli remain to be defined, but are likely to include populations within the innate immune system (7) . Failure in receipt or transduction of these signals is hypothesized to result in postnatal prolongation of fetal Th 2 -polarization within the immune system, thus increasing risk for atopic sensitization and atopic asthma (7) . However, it is also apparent that acute respiratory illness (ARI) can serve as a double-edged sword in this context, as intense wheezing-associated ARI during infancy can synergize with inhalant allergy to drive asthma pathogenesis (8) , presumably by disrupting sensitive differentiation programs regulating the growth and development of airway tissues during this life phase (9) .",

            "text": "We have previously suggested that the increased severity of ARI in infants at high risk for atopy may be due in large part to a developmental delay in postnatal maturation of their adaptive immune functions (9) , in particular their diminished capacity to secrete both Th 2 and (especially) Th 1 cytokines (9) , which are central Atopy is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation associated with recruitment of eosinophil/basophil (Eo/B) progenitors. We have previously shown that Eo/B progenitor phenotypes are altered in cord blood (CB) in infants at high risk of atopy/asthma, and respond to maternal dietary intervention during pregnancy. As respiratory tract viral infections have been shown to induce wheeze in infancy, we investigated the relationship between CB progenitor function and phenotype and acute respiratory illness (ARI), specifically wheeze and fever. CB from 39 high-risk infants was studied by flow cytometry for CD34 + progenitor phenotype and by ex vivo Eo/B-colony forming unit (CFU) responses to cytokine stimulation in relation to ARI in the first year of life. A consistent relationship was observed between increased numbers of granulocyte/macrophage (GM)-colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-and IL-3-responsive Eo/B-CFU in CB and the frequency/characteristics of ARI during infancy. Comparable associations were found between ARI and CB IL-3R + and GM-CSFR + CD34 + cell numbers. Conversely, a reciprocal decrease in the proportion of CB IL-5R + cells was found in relation to the clinical outcomes. The elevation of IL-3/GM-CSFresponsive Eo/B progenitors in high-risk infants in relation to ARI outcomes suggests a mechanism for the increased severity of inflammatory responses in these subjects following viral infection. to host defence. However, it is equally feasible that non-cognate inflammatory effector cells such as mast cells, basophils, eosinophils (Eo/B), or their progenitors may also play a critical role in determining the degree of inflammation and hence frequency/severity of symptoms accompanying ARI during infancy, thus contributing to asthma development. In this context, studies we have recently performed demonstrate that deficient maturation of cord blood (CB) eosinophil progenitors, as evidenced by reduced expression of hemopoietic cytokine receptors, may predict the subsequent development of atopic disease (10), including wheeze and atopic dermatitis in the first year of life (11), a process which is reversed by dietary supplementation with n-3 omega fatty acids during pregnancy (12) .",

At least one parent of each child had a medical diagnosis of eczema, hay fever or asthma; atopy was confirmed by skin prick test (SPT) in one or more parent of 96% of the children. Selection of infants for this sub-study was based on availability of cryo-banked CB cells; preservation and viability of cells has been high and has not been known to alter properties of progenitors (10, 11, 13) . Parents were asked to keep a daily diary of their child's health and to notify the study centre within 48 h of their child developing a runny/ blocked nose, cough or fever (>38\u00b0C). The presence of fever for at least 24 h was recorded but did not form part of the clinical definition of ARI. Home visits were made to take postnasal aspirate samples of mucous within 72 h. Samples were collected and frozen at )85\u00b0C for future polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Follow-up telephone calls were made every 2 wk until resolution of all symptoms. Information collected included the presence, as well as duration, of symptoms of fever, runny/blocked nose, cough, and wheeze. This report utilizes data collected during the first year of life.",

Our laboratory has previously shown that the measurement of cytokine receptor expression on hemopoietic CD34 + progenitors in CB can be used as a marker related to risk and prediction of atopy and in this study, we attempt to demonstrate that progenitors can serve as markers of ARI and symptoms. Specifically, we have observed that there is a significant, inverse correlation between the numbers of undifferentiated progenitors (CD34 + /45 + cells overall) and febrile responses to ARI (Fig. 1) ; this result is totally in agreement with our previous observation of \u00d4restoration\u00d5 of a normal, high ambient level of undifferentiated progenitors after polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) treatment of the mother, which correlates with improved first year atopic outcomes (12, 21) . PUFA has been thought to play in role in the prevention/reversal of allergy. Moreover, we have recently observed that CB CD34 + progenitors of infants at high risk for atopy and asthma (as evidenced by maternal SPT) have an increased expression of IL-3R (p \u00bc 0.018, R \u00bc )0.887), and decreased IL-5R expression (p \u00bc 0.021, R \u00bc )0.879) (Cyr et al, in preparation). Similarly, in the current study, the absence of IL-5 responsiveness, the combined IL-3R and GM-CSFR expression on CD34 + CB cells, as well as corresponding functional (CFU) responses to these cytokines, correlated positively and significantly with ARI frequency and accompanying symptoms from three months through the first year of life. This was also reflected as an apparent skewing towards IL-3 and GM-CSF responsive myeloid progenitor phenotypes and functions, as shown by ratio analyses comparing CB from infants at high risk for atopy/asthma and those at low risk.",

            "text": "One interpretation of these findings is that the intensity of acute inflammatory responses triggered by ARI in infancy, which is determined to a large extent by the efficiency of recruitment of inflammatory effector cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils, may be directly related to the numbers or phenotype of available, lineage- committed hemopoietic progenitors in the circulation. While IL-3, GM-CSF and IL-5 are each involved in eosinophil differentiation, IL-3-and GM-CSF-responsive progenitors represent earlier stages in lineage commitment than IL-5-responsive progenitors, and thus would be expected to be more \u00d4promiscuous\u00d5 in the sense that they could contribute to development of multi-cellular (neutrophilic and eosinophilic) inflammatory responses. Situations in which the frequency of these progenitors exceeds a critical threshold results in significant pathological consequences, contrasting with the situation involving a more \u00d4mature\u00d5 compartment dominated by eosinophil progenitors which have differentiated further towards exclusive IL-5-responsiveness, in which eosinophil generation is tightly regulated by the availability of IL-5 (22) . It is thought that highrisk infants are subject to delayed immune deviation (22) . Therefore, initial lack of IL-5 in infancy could result in compensation by an overshoot of the IL-5 response later in childhood, causing increased deposition of tissue eosinophilia in response to environmental stimuli, deeming the child atopic. Alternatively, decreased IL-5R expression may be a consequence of increased maternal T-cell production of IL-5, causing downregulation of receptor in utero (23). We do not have CB differential counts to accompany the progenitor data, so these explanations remain speculative.",

However, as the individual progresses from infancy to childhood, viral modulation of the host response could result in modification from a multi-cellular inflammatory profile to a purely eosinophilic response. It is the snapshot of the progenitor phenotype in infancy that captures host progenitor regulation processes and allows us to compare these with the picture of inflammation in childhood, thus serving as an indicator that mirrors deficiencies in all other immune compartments.",

For instance, local generation of IL-3 and/or GM-CSF would be an integral component of host defence mechanisms, which in turn may result in fever. The immunological progenitor profiles of infants with ARI accompanied by fever differ from infants who acquired ARI without fever. An imbalance in these profiles is more evident in the symptomatic group, as demonstrated by significant correlations between febrile ARI and IL-3 Eo/B CFU and an inverse significant correlation between febrile ARI and CD34 + cells. This indicates that decreased numbers, but increased ratios of undifferentiated CD34 + progenitors to mature immune cells exist during ARI with fever. The profile that occurs with ARI alone may have this imbalance to a lesser degree, as evidenced by significant correlations between IL-3R and GM-CSFR phenotypes with ARI in the first year of life. A similar imbalance can also be attributed to ARI with wheeze, as indicated by the findings that GM-CSF-stimulated CFU positively correlated with overall frequency of ARI accompanied by wheeze during the first year of life (p \u00bc 0.023). Therefore, imbalances in progenitor phenotypic and functional responses appear to be more evident in symptomatic ARI, as opposed to ARI alone.",

Given the central role of eosinophils and neutrophils in viral wheeze in infancy (22) , this finding provides a plausible mechanism for viral induced wheeze, often termed transient, in at-risk children in this age group. Martinez et al. (24) found that the wheeze present in high-risk infants may be transient or remain persistent through childhood, and have suggested that 15% of infants who wheeze progress to chronic asthma, mostly those associated with familial atopic disease . These principles have been extended by other groups to incorporate the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) profile of different subtypes of wheezers, showing that the total number of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the BAL is increased in wheezing infants compared with controls; this may parallel our findings of increased numbers of \u00d4immature progenitors\u00d5 in CB (25, 26) . RSV may also contribute directly and indirectly to the factor of wheeze, given that 80% of infants experience at least one RSV ARI in the first year of life. Whereas severe RSV ARI are thought to be accompanied by high IL-4/IFN-c production, both Th 1 and Th 2 type responses occur during this infection (27) . Our results showed that RSV ARI at 1 yr of age were not significantly correlated with phenotypic or functional changes in CD34 + cells, with the exception of febrile RSV ARI, which tended towards significance with IL-3 Eo/B CFU (p \u00bc 0.056), consistent with our positing an earlier, perhaps more \u00d4immature\u00d5 progenitor in these high-risk infants.",

Nonetheless, it is also likely that many of these high-risk children have parallel defects in other immune and inflammatory pathways that contribute towards enhanced susceptibility to ARI. In particular, we have established that a central element of genetic risk for atopy and asthma is transient developmental deficiency in adaptive immune function, which manifests as attenuated capacity to secrete both Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines (9) , and this at-risk immunophenotype is already discernible in the fetal compartment (17) . Comparable atopic risk-related developmental deficiencies have also been reported in the innate compartment in monocytic/dendritic cell lineages (30) , and our recent studies (31) indicate that the latter also are associated with increased susceptibility to ARI.",

We postulate that atopic high-risk infants have developmental deficiencies in many compartments, perhaps in conjunction with genetic lung deficiencies and environmental triggers. This has been shown in the Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) study: cytokine dysregulation accompanied by environmental insult could predispose high-risk infants to atopic asthma (32) and predict immune and therapeutic profiles later in childhood (33) . Current concepts of the immunological basis for risk of asthma/atopy must now include altered functional status of cell populations within the bone marrow as well as the cord blood. The common factor for risk of disease development appears to be postnatal persistence of functionally immature cell phenotypes in several (myeloid and lymphoid) compartments. It is yet to be determined how discrete, or lineage-specific, genetic mechanisms and/or environmental factors are involved.",
