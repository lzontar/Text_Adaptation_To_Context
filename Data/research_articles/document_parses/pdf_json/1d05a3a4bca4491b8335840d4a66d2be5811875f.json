Both maps were filtered to 15\u00c5 resolution prior to comparison.

The contrast transfer function (CTF) was determined per micrograph using CTFIT (Ludtke et al., 1999) and corrected by phase flipping with the program Applyctf followed by combination of corrected images that had different defocuses (EMAN; Ludtke et al., 1999 ). An initial reconstruction, with a resolution of 17.6\u00c5, was generated by reference-based alignment and reconstruction using our previous model of 80S SL (Namy et al., 2006 ). This initial model was refined using reference based methods with correlation coefficient-based particle selection calculated over the P-site tRNA, as defined by a spherical mask. The refinement process was iterated six times, whereupon the resolution had reached 13.6\u00c5 and incorporated 24,738/38,720 particles.

            "text": "Data analysis for the PK-stalled ribosome 64,413 particles were excised using Boxer (EMAN program suite; Ludtke et al., 1999) with a combination of automatic and manual particle picking. The dataset used was over four times the size of that previously analysed and as above was collected using a 300 kV microscope rather than a 200 kV one. The CTF was determined and corrected as for the 80S SL sample above. After a few rounds of reference-based refinement starting from a previouslydetermined 80S PK reconstruction (Namy et al., 2006) in Spider (operations AP SH and BP RP; Frank et al., 1996) , the reconstruction converged displaying a bent tRNA, and quite weak EF2 density (Main text Figure 1A , 1B). The resolution of the map could not be improved beyond 16.7\u00c5 (which was also the resolution of our previously-determined 80S PK complex structure). This led us to hypothesise that the particle population was heterogeneous in composition, with higher occupancy of tRNA than EF-2. To examine particle heterogeneity, we created an omit map by electronically removing EF-2, tRNA and pseudoknot density from our pseudoknot-stalled ribosome using a spherical mask for the tRNA and tubular masks for the pseudoknot and EF-2. This model served for a round of reference-based alignment and reconstruction using Spider, as above. As shown in Main text Figure 2C (lower panel) weaker density, and therefore lower occupancy, was found for EF-2 compared to tRNA, which had strong density and clearly was in a bent conformation as previously observed. As it was observed in the context of an omit map calculation, this bent hybrid-state conformation of the A/P tRNA in the pseudoknot-stalled ribosome is further confirmed, similar to the way that the presence of an antigen peptide in a major histocompatibility complex groove confirms a successful molecular replacement solution in crystallography (Stewart-Jones et al., 2005) . Based on our omit map observations we sorted our particle image dataset into three subsets using multi-reference supervised classification (Allen et al., 2005; Gilbert et al., 2007) : 80S Apo , 80S PK-tRNA and 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 . To do this, we generated three models. For the 80S Apo subset we used the 80S Apo reconstruction determined previously (Namy et al., 2006) , for the 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 subset we used the 80S PK reconstruction determined previously (Namy et al., 2006) , and for the 80S PK-tRNA subset we again used our previously-determined stalled complex, but with density arising from EF-2 computationally set to background level. These three models were then used in multi-reference reprojection-based alignment of the data and the whole dataset of 80S PK images sorted by correlation coefficient following alignment, using spherical or generous-threshold masks to focus the correlation calculation on the regions of the images occupied by PK, tRNA and EF-2. Spherical masks were used for the pseudoknot and tRNAs, and a generously-thresholded tubular mask for EF2 were computed using the program GAP (Grimes et al., 1998; Gilbert et al., 2004) assisted by Chimera software (Pettersen et al., 2004) . We thus minimised model bias deriving from selection of particles for reconstruction based on density within masks having the same form as the molecules for which we were searching (Penczek et al. 2006 ). The sorted particles and their corresponding alignment parameters were used to generate three new reconstructions (80S Apo , 80S PK-tRNA and 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 ) which were used again to align the whole dataset and so select particle images for the three subsets; this scheme was iterated 5 times. When we were confident that realistic subclassification of the particle images had been obtained, we refined the 80S PK-tRNA and 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 subsets over four more iterations, using multi-referencebased reconstruction with correlation coefficient-based particle selection, to resolutions of 15.3\u00c5 for 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 and 14.9 \u00c5 for 80S PK-tRNA . The final image distribution was 19,705 images to the 80S Apo subset, 20,215 to 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 and 24,494 to 80S PK-tRNA . The 80S Apo reconstruction was not refined subsequent to the final subclassification since our previous 80S Apo structure is superior, coming from a homogeneous 80S Apo sample preparation. As for the 80S SL structure, all resolutions were estimated by Fourier shell correlation ( Figure S1A ).",

To ameliorate this we computed thermal B factors, after Rosenthal and Henderson (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003) , using Guinier analysis and then applied them, negatively, to the reconstructions. For each of the maps spherically averaged structure factor intensities were calculated using the map analysis program WellMAP (J.F.F. and R.J.C.G., manuscript in preparation). Then, thermal B factors in the data were extracted by fitting a line to the Wilson scattering regime, below 10\u00c5, where the slope determines the B factor applied to each reconstruction (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003) . The 80S SL reconstruction was found to have a B factor of 240 \u00c5 2 , the 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 190 \u00c5 2 , and the 80S PK-tRNA 210 \u00c5 2 .

Each model was manually fitted into reconstructed density with O (Jones et al., 1991) and refined using URO (Navaza et al., 2002) . The tRNAs and EF-2 were fit as single rigid bodies while the 40S (2ZKQ) and 60S (2ZKR) subunit fits were further refined as separate rigid bodies. Small subunit regions protein RACK1 and expansion segment ES6 part I, and large subunit regions protein L12 and ES7, ES9, ES15 and ES19 were treated in this way. In the case where no suitable density was found for a feature of the model it was removed. The caption for Figure S2 lists the removed model segments. For the density arising from EF2 associated with tRNA, the tRNA was fit first, due to its highly distinctive density, allowing us to define more easily the molecular envelope of EF-2. As the tRNA and EF2 have undergone significant conformational changes their fits were refined after rigid-body alignment using NMFF (Tama et al., 2003; using the 20 lowest modes and a maximum displacement of 1\u00c5 per iteration to minimize stereochemical perturbations. After NMFF fitting we performed 10 cycles of RefMac5 (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 (1994)) structure idealization. The tRNA fits are shown in Figure 4C of the main text and in Figure S5A for the two PK-stalled tRNAs, for clarification. In Figure S5B -D we show the normal modes-assisted fit compared to the structure of EF-2 complexed with sordarin and the previous rigid body fit (Namy et al., 2006) . The conformation uncovered by normal modes-guided fitting, like the rigid-body fit, reveals that domains I, II and G' superimpose well with the crystal structure of yeast eEF2 complexed with sordarin ( Figure S5B ). This is to be expected given that these domains within the EF-2-sordarin complex superimpose well on Apo EF-2 and seem to be structurally conserved (J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2003) . However, the ~90\u00b0 rotation of domains III-V about domains I, II and G' discovered in the normal modes-assisted fit (Supplementary Figure 5C ) is greater than the twist modelled previously without them (Namy et al., 2006) , where an additional rotation of ~45\u00b0 about domain IV, with respect to EF-2-sordarin, and a small translation towards the P site, were inferred ( Figure S5D ). Our new model illustrates good packing between domains I-G' and domains III-V, whereas our previous model had these regions slightly detached; however the key point is that both models reveal domain IV in contact with the tRNA (Figures S5C and S5D) . Given the improved density to which we are able to fit EF-2, the assistance of normal modes, and the resulting better molecular packing within the fitted EF-2, this represents an improved model of EF-2 bound to a ribosome and caught in the process of translocation.",
