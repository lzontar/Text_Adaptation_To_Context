This pilot project aims to coordinate pro bono forensic mental health evaluations, by telephone or video call, of individuals seeking asylum or other forms of protected immigration status in the U.S. The remote network is an expansion of MSHRP, a program of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai which facilitates forensic evaluations to document the physical and psychological sequelae of human rights abuses and explain these findings to adjudicators of immigration claims. MSHRP coordinates nearly 200 such forensic evaluations of asylum seekers annually in New York City and provides continuity medical care and social services. Three factors prompted the development of the remote network: (a) an increase in requests for evaluations outside of the New York City area, especially for individuals in detention or in areas without human rights programs; (b) anecdotal feedback from attorneys", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "Future research should survey the nationwide availability of pro bono forensic medical services to guide efficient, equitable allocation of remote services.

There was no difference between telephonic and in-person evaluations for 26 of 30 criteria. Common differences included assessment of general appearance and psychomotor retardation. There was no difference in distribution of PostTraumatic Stress Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder. Evaluator experiences: Although evaluators with telephonic experience noted that lack of visual cues made establishing rapport and assessing mental status more difficult, they expressed comparable ability to diagnose individuals and testify in a client's trial. Before the interview: Evaluators should consider what preparation is needed, including setting and equipment, electronic surveys emailed in advance, and location of a language interpreter. Sending a photo of the evaluator in advance may help overcome the barrier to rapport building. At the beginning of the interview: Evaluators should orient the evaluee to the purpose, format, and degree of confidentiality of the evaluation. Acknowledge limitations of telephonic modality and ask for assistance of the evaluee and interpreter, if co-located, in communicating distress, discomfort, and need for breaks. Consider asking the evaluee to describe their settings, including the level of privacy. During the interview: Evaluators should minimize distractions by sitting away from their computer even if using it to take notes. Interludes in language interpretation can be beneficial for taking notes and collecting thoughts. At the end of the interview: Evaluators should consider sharing impressions with the evaluee and providing psychoeducation. Evaluators may also provide recommendations for follow up. </td></tr><tr><td>Best Practices </td></tr><tr><td>Common </td><td>Loss of non-verbal cues: Evaluators can still rely on audible cues (e.g., crying, long pauses) to guide their interviewing and help assess mental status. Ability to assess credibility or truthfulness: Even for in-person evaluations malingering is usually not an issue because individuals have already been vetted by experienced immigration attorneys. Building a therapeutic alliance: The goal of the telephonic evaluation is forensic, unfortunately not therapeutic. Informal attorney feedback suggests that individuals often find the experience to be therapeutic despite the barriers. Communicating via interpreter: For telephonic evaluation, the communicating by interpreter can actually be advantageous. An interpreter co-located with a client can provide visual data. Pauses for interpretation also make note taking easier. Confirming client identity: Similar to in-person evaluations, evaluators should rely on immigration attorneys to confirm the time and place of evaluations. </td></tr><tr><td>Concerns </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "Characteristics of Clients Served by the Remote Evaluation Network (n = 15), December 2019 to April 2020", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Total (n = 15) </td><td>Percent of Total (Rounded) </td></tr><tr><td>Age (years) </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Minor, &lt; 18 </td><td>1 </td><td>7% </td></tr><tr><td>Adult, 18-35 </td><td>8 </td><td>53% </td></tr><tr><td>Adult, &gt;35 </td><td>6 </td><td>40% </td></tr><tr><td>Gender Trans-gender woman </td><td>1 </td><td>7% </td></tr><tr><td>Trans-gender man </td><td>0 </td><td>0% </td></tr><tr><td>Cis-gender woman </td><td>3 </td><td>20% </td></tr><tr><td>Cis-gender man </td><td>11 </td><td>73% </td></tr><tr><td>Region of Origin Caribbean </td><td>6 </td><td>40% </td></tr><tr><td>Central America </td><td>7 </td><td>47% </td></tr><tr><td>East Asia and Pacific </td><td>1 </td><td>7% </td></tr><tr><td>Sub-Saharan Africa </td><td>1 </td><td>7% </td></tr><tr><td>Primary Type of Protected Status Sought Asylum </td><td>11 </td><td>73% </td></tr><tr><td>Cancellation / Withholding of Removal </td><td>2 </td><td>13% </td></tr><tr><td>United Nations Convention Against Torture </td><td>1 </td><td>7% </td></tr><tr><td>T Nonimmigrant Status (T Visa) </td><td>1 </td><td>7% </td></tr><tr><td>Current Region in United States </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Midwest </td><td>2 </td><td>13% </td></tr><tr><td>Northeast </td><td>5 </td><td>33% </td></tr><tr><td>South </td><td>7 </td><td>47% </td></tr><tr><td>West </td><td>1 </td><td>7% </td></tr><tr><td>Location Community </td><td>2 </td><td>13% </td></tr><tr><td>Detention </td><td>13 </td><td>87% </td></tr><tr><td>ICE Facility </td><td>9 </td><td>69% </td></tr><tr><td>Correctional Facility </td><td>4 </td><td>31% </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF6": {"text": ". https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20063677 doi: medRxiv preprint Attitudes towards tele-psychiatric evaluations How comfortable are you conducting remote, telephonic or video psychiatric interviews?
