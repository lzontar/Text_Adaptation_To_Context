The results show that the antiviral effect of PPIX was mainly observable in the early stage of infection. Based on these results, we further identified that the activity may have resulted from the interactions of PPIX with the lipid bilayer of the virus envelope, thereby inhibiting the entry of virus; this was deduced from fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 3B, Fig. 4A and Fig. S1A) , NMR experiments (Table S1) , and semiquantitative ITC analyses (Table S2 and Fig. S1C ). This conclusion is consistent with the results of our previous study, showing that the antiviral activity of Pyropheophorbide a (PPa) was due to the interaction 17 with the viral membrane or biophysical interference with the virus-cell membrane fusion process, which resulted in blocking the entry of an enveloped virus into cells (17) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 930, "end": 932, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1104, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 284, "end": 292, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 646, "end": 677, "text": "(Fig. 3B, Fig. 4A and Fig. S1A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 696, "end": 706, "text": "(Table S1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 743, "end": 765, "text": "(Table S2 and Fig. S1C", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "< Fig. 6>"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, considering the pivotal role of hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus in mediating the entry of the virus, the results of the fusion inhibition assay (Fig. 4C and 4D) cannot exclude the possibility that the antiviral activity may have resulted from the interaction of PPIX with the surface glycoprotein HA, blocking the entry of the virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 182, "text": "(Fig. 4C and 4D)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "< Fig. 6>"}, {"text": "However, (1) both the negative results of the hemagglutinin inhibition assay and hemolysis inhibition assay (Fig. 2D and 2E) showed that PPIX was unable to either block the absorption of virus onto host cells or inhibit the fusion of virus with the host cell membrane (18, 22) ; (2) PPIX showed broad antiviral activities against a number of unrelated enveloped viruses belonging to different families; and (3) PPIX showed interactions with the lipid bilayer.
