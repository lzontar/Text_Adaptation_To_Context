            "text": "The well-known Linear Chain Trick (LCT) allows modelers to derive mean field ODEs that assume gamma (Erlang) distributed passage times, by transitioning individuals sequentially through a chain of sub-states. The time spent in these states is the sum of k exponentially distributed random variables, and is thus gamma (Erlang) distributed. The Generalized Linear Chain Trick (GLCT) extends this technique to the much broader phase-type family of distributions, which includes exponential, Erlang, hypoexponential, and Coxian distributions. Intuitively, phase-type distributions are the absorption time distributions for continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs). Here we review CTMCs and phase-type distributions, then illustrate how to use the GLCT to efficiently build mean field ODE models from underlying stochastic model assumptions. We generalize the Rosenzweig-MacArthur and SEIR models and show the benefits of using the GLCT to compute numerical solutions. These results highlight some practical benefits, and the intuitive nature, of using the GLCT to derive ODE models from first principles.",

            "text": "Continuous time state transition models, often formulated as mean field ODE models, are widely used throughout the biological sciences and across multiple scales. Examples include models of multi-species interactions, infectious disease transmission, cell proliferation, and various other applications in which entities transition among a finite number of states (e.g., Allen, 2007; Anderson and May, 1992; Arrowsmith and Place, 1990; Beuter et al., 2003; Clapp and Levy, 2015; Dayan and Abbott, 2005; Edelstein-Keshet, 2005; Ellner and Guckenheimer, 2006; Hirsch, Smale, and Devaney, 2012; Izhikevich, 2010; Keener and Sneyd, 2008a,b; Meiss, 2017; Murray, 2011a,b; Strogatz, 2014; Wiggins, 2003; Yates, Ford, and Mort, 2017) . One criticism of mean field ODE models is that they often implicitly assume the time individuals spend in the different states are exponentially distributed, and it is known that the timing of state transitions can very meaningfully affect model dynamics and model outputs in an applied setting (Getz et al., 2018; Krylova and Earn, 2013; Metz and Diekmann, 1986; Metz and Diekmann, 1991; Nisbet, Gurney, and Metz, 1989; Robertson et al., 2018; Wearing, Rohani, and Keeling, 2005) . That is, an ODE model with a linear loss rate can be interpreted as implicitly assuming an underlying stochastic state transmission model with an exponentially distributed dwell-time in that focal state. For example, the simple model dx/dt = b \u2212 d x is consistent with assuming an underlying stochastic state transition model in which individuals spend an exponentially distributed amount of time with mean 1/d in the state corresponding to variable x.",

This is accomplished by partitioning a state into a series of k sub-states, where individuals transition sequentially through this ''linear chain\" of states. The resulting time spent in this collection of sub-states is thus the sum of k exponentially distributed random variables, and therefore follows an Erlang distribution (if each exponential has the same rate) or a generalized Erlang 2 distribution if the rates differ.",

The paper is organized as follows. First, we review CTMCs and phase-type distributions. We then state the GLCT for phase-type distributions and, for comparison, the well-known LCT. In the Results section, we generalize some simple biological state transition models by replacing their implicit assumption of exponentially distributed passage time assumptions with arbitrary phase-type distributions. Lastly, we investigate some of the computational costs and benefits of using this generalized model framework with regards to computing numerical solutions.",

Due to the memorylessness property of exponential distributions transitions from state i to state i can effectively be ignored, thus we can formulate a new transition probability matrix that describes an equivalent Markov chain but where we only track transitions to new states. This reformulated Markov chain is known as the embedded jump process (or embedded Markov chain), and it is described with a transition probability matrix P where the diagonal entries are 0 and the off-diagonal transition probabilities p ij = p ij / j =i p ij . That is, these are just the off-diagonal entries of P with the diagonal set to 0, and the rows normalized so each row sums to 1.

We found that, for low dimensional models, the GLCT-based computations are slower than using a more traditional approach; however for higher dimensional models, the GLCT-based computations were faster. This improvement in computing time is likely the result of the computational efficiency of doing matrix and vector based computations. In addition to faster computation times, another benefit of the GLCT-based approach is that only one ODE model function needs to be written since it is agnostic of the model dimension.
