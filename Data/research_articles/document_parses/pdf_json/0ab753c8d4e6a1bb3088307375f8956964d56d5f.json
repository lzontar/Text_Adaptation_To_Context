            "text": "To explore a method for enhancing the immobilization and hybridization efficiency of oligonucleotides on DNA microarrays, conventional protocols of poly-L-lysine coating were modified by means of surface chemistry, namely, the slides were prepared by the covalently coupling of poly-L-lysine to a glycidoxy-modified glass surface. The modified slides were then used to print microarrays for the detection of the SARS coronavirus by means of 60mer oligonucleotide probes. The characteristics of the modified slides concerning immobilization efficiency, hybridization dynamics, and probe stripping cycles were determined. The improved surface exhibited high immobilization efficiency, a good quality uniformity, and satisfactory hybridization dynamics. The spotting concentration of 10 lmol/L can meet the requirements of detection; the spots were approximately 170 nm in diameter; the mean fluorescence intensity of the SARS spots were between 3.2 10 4 and 5.0 10 4 after hybridization. Furthermore, the microarrays prepared by this method demonstrated more resistance to consecutive probe stripping cycles. The activated GOPS-PLL slide could undergo hybridization stripping cycles for at least three cycles, and the highest loss in fluorescence intensity was found to be only 11.9 % after the third hybridization. The modified slides using the above-mentioned method were superior to those slides treated with conventional approaches, which theoretically agrees with the fact that modification by surface chemistry attaches the DNA covalently firmly to the slides. This protocol may have great promise in the future for application in large-scale manufacture. 466 469 Figure 4 . SARS oligonucleotide microarray hybridized with SARS patients' sample (12 12). The SARS patients' samples are labeled by means of the RD-PCR method.

Oligonucleotide microarrays have been applied to genetic mutational scanning and polymorphism analysis [1\u00b13], screening of disease and selecting antisense reagents [4] , and monitoring of gene expression [5, 6] . In oligonucleotide microarray fabrication, the first problem that has to be faced and needs to be resolved is to immobilize or directly synthesize oligonucleotides on solid supports. Methods for immobilizing oligonucleotides mainly include physical adsorption and covalent linkage. Oligonucleotides that were bound to the surface by the former method were unstable and liable to be removed from the surface. Hence, according to Taylor et al. [7] the oligonucleotide immobilization by physical adsorption is gradually being substituted by methods that promote covalent linkage.",

The poly-L-lysine coated glass slide, prepared by protocols of Patrick Brown's Lab, was widely applied in cDNA microarray. The main mechanism of binding DNA onto the surface is physical adsorption. A specific binding probably results from an electrostatic interaction of the phosphate backbone of DNA and the positively charged amino surface. Moreover, DNA (usually PCR amplified material) was immobilized by ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation to form covalent bonds between the thymidine residues in DNA and the positively charged amine groups on the poly-L-lysine slides.

The results confirmed that both properties were superior to those of the PLL surface microarray as a consequence of the introduction of chemical PDITC causing more oligos to attach to the surface. Furthermore, the experiment of probe stripping revealed that the surface was more stable against high pH, salt and temperature. The results demonstrated that PLL was covalently bound to the surface as designed. A GOPS-PLL surface is a compact polymer layer in materials, which enhances not only the immobilization efficiency but also the stability. Therefore, in experiments of hybridization and the detection of the SARS coronavirus, the spots were more homogenic and sensitive. These results are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 .",

            "text": "In conclusion, the conventional method of poly-L-lysine coating onto a microscope glass surface was modified to achieve a covalent immobilization of unmodified oligonucleotide on the glass surface. The oligonucleotides were linked stable, and the sensitivity of detection was improved. Satisfactory results were obtained in the experiments. A spotting concentration of 10 lmol/L was able to satisfy the requirements of detection. The spots were approximately 170 nm in diameter, and the mean fluorescence intensity of the SARS spots were in a range of 3.2 10 4 to 5.0 10 4 after hybridization, whereas the fluorescence intensities of the background were only between 100 and 300. Furthermore, the microarrays prepared by means of this method were more resistant to consecutive probe stripping cycles. The activated GOPS-PLL slide could undergo at least three hybridization stripping cycles, and the highest loss of fluorescence intensity amounted to only 11.9 % after the third hybridization. At the same time, the GOPS-PLL coating method is not complicated and not expensive when applied for large-scale manufacture. Further efforts will be taken so that such oligonucleotide microarray platform can be used in cDNA microarrays as well.",
