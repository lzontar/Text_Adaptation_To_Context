            "text": "RNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modelings and therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr, in mouse hepatocytes. CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels. Importantly, CasRx-mediated knockdown of Pcsk9 is 3 reversible and Pcsk9 could be repeatedly down-regulated, providing an effective strategy to reversibly modulate metabolic genes. The present work supplies a successful proof-of-concept trial that suggests efficient and regulatory knockdown of target metabolic genes for a designed metabolism modulation in the liver.",

In the past decades, many strategies of metabolic regulations were achieved through using various modulators, including numerous small molecular compounds, nucleic acids, and therapeutic polypeptides/proteins targeting individual or multiple defined molecular products, such as enzymes, circulating proteins, cell-surface receptors and cellular RNAs (Moller, 2012) . Applications of metabolic modulation have great potential for disease modeling and therapies. However, developing novel approaches with more specific and more flexible modulation of metabolic genes in vivo is still challenging, because natural and synthesized modulators with high targeting specificity are theoretically limited.",

Previously, Pten was known as a metabolic regulator that suppressed the insulin signaling by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway (Cho et al., 2001; Stiles et al., 2004) . Deletion of Pten promoted AKT phosphorylation (Stiles et al., 2004) . Accordingly, such effects were also shown in our results after the successful knockdown of Pten through the combination of sgPten-5 and sgPten-6. In the N2a cells that were transfected with CasRx, sgPten-5 and sgPten-6, the PTEN protein levels were significanty decreased while the AKT phosphorylation levels were significantly elevated (Fig. 1C ).",

The CasRx system has, however, been reported to be with significantly reduced off-target events compared to other RNAi approaches (Konermann et al., 2018) . Here, we set out to compare the CasRx system with spacer sequence-match shRNAs in knockdown of Pten via transient transfection in N2a cells. Consistent with previous studies, Pten-targeting shRNAs rendered wide-spread off-target transcript changes (Fig. 1D ). In contrast, transfection of the spacer-matched CasRx system induced significantly reduced transcript changes (Fig. 1D) . Importantly, Pten was the most significantly changed gene (Fig. 1D ).

            "text": "CasRx system in RNA knockdown in vivo. These results support our long-term goal to model and develop therapies of metabolic diseases. Over the past few years, advancements in CRISPR systems have provided plentiful tools for genome editing, epigenetic modification and transcript activation/inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the development of a CasRx-mediated in vivo gene knockdown system is becoming more relied upon for disease modeling, genetic screening, mechanism studies, and therapeutic purposes. Remarkably, different from CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing with permanent disruption of DNA in vivo, CasRx-mediated modification is used to target RNAs, instead of genomic DNA(Zhang et al., 2018). This impermanent modification makes the CasRx system more valuable for modeling metabolism disorders considering the required reversible downregulation of metabolism genes.Moreover, CasRx-mediated modification can ideally also be used for therapeutic applications in clinical metabolism disorders because of its advantages in terms of reversible manipulations of gene expressions.1 3In this study, hepatocytes were treated as the targeting locations because they are one of the most important cell types to maintain metabolism homeostasis in the human body. Indeed, many drug candidates were first designed to target proteins that are produced by the hepatocytes in order to correct metabolic disorders. Because hepatocytes are composed of a large fraction of polyploid cells(Duncan et al., 2010), the multiple copies of an individual gene in one hepatocyte make CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene knockout less efficient. Thus, posttranscriptional silencing approaches attracted much attention for disrupting gene expression in the liver, which can rely on the CasRx system for modulation of mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level. The successful CasRx-mediated gene knockdown in hepatocytes is expected to be beneficial to similar approaches in other cells. Compared to",

A Cas9-based DNA-targeting strategy has been reported to function in disruption of genome DNA or DNA intermediates of viruses(Liu et al., 2015;Ophinni et al., 2018;Price et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2017). However, RNA viruses with neither genome DNA nor DNA intermediates, such as deadly SARS-Cov-2 (2019-nCov), SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov and influenza A virus, could not be targeted by DNA-targeting CRISPR effectors. Recently, RNA-targeting Cas13 was experimentally validated for its antiviral activity in cell lines infected with single-stranded RNA viruses(Freije et al., 2019). In this study, we validated that CasRx, a Cas13 family protein, could also functionally target RNA in vivo,further supporting the potential use of CasRx in RNA-targeting therapies. target gene regulation by RNAi.
