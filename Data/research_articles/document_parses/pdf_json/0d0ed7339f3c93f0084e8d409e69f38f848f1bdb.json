Early in the epidemic, patients were classified as having either a suspected case of SARS or a probable case of SARS on the basis of clinical and epidemiological criteria established by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2] . In brief, a suspected case of SARS was defined as high fever (temperature, 138\u040aC), symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (e.g., cough or shortness of breath), and exposure within 10 days before the onset of illness to either a patient with suspected or probable SARS or to an area with documented cases of SARS transmission. A probable case of SARS was defined as a suspected case of SARS with changes in chest radiograph findings indicative of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. After the development of specific tests for the detection of coronavirus, this definition was modified to incorporate the results of laboratory tests [3] .",

The findings of the physical examination were otherwise normal. The findings of a chest radiograph obtained at admission to the hospital were clear. Laboratory studies performed at admission to the hospital revealed a normal WBC count ( cells/L) with a mild lymphopenia 9 4.80 \u03eb 10 ( lymphocytes/L). The total creatinine kinase level 9 1.12 \u03eb 10 was elevated at 628 U/L (normal range, 20-300 U/L). The liver enzyme, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were normal. The patient had a peak temperature of 40\u040aC during the first 24 h of hospitalization and thereafter rapidly defervesced. She was observed in the hospital for 72 h and did not develop any respiratory symptoms. The findings of 3 additional chest radiographs were normal. The results of routine cultures of blood and urine samples, as well as the results of serologic tests, were negative for Mycoplasma and Legionella. The results of an RT-PCR assay performed on urine samples were negative for SARS coronavirus (no testing was done on serum samples or samples of respiratory secretions). A convalescent-phase serum sample obtained 26 days after the onset of illness tested positive for coronavirus antibodies (Standard Diagnostics; Kyonggi-do, Korea). The results of additional tests of the same serum sample using an indirect immunofluorescence assay and a 1:50 dilution of test serum with PBS were also positive. Using a previously described microneutralization test [5] that we adapted to SARS cornoavirus with Vero E6 cells, the serum sample was further tested for neutralization antibody to SARS coronavirus with a serum dilution range from 1:10 to 1:320. The neutralization antibody titer in this serum specimen was 20. Serum samples obtained from a volunteer patient with SARS and a laboratory staff member who was unexposed to SARS were included in all serologic assays as positive and negative controls, respectively. Our patient was discharged from the hospital and continues to remain healthy without respiratory symptoms after 2 months of regular follow-up.",

Of note, in patients with normal or equivocal chest radiograph findings on admission to the hospital, conventional or high-resolution CT of the chest has been able to demonstrate parenchymal abnormalities [8, 9] . However, because of her rapid defervescence, the absence of respiratory complaints, and 4 serial chest radiographs that yielded normal findings, there was no clinical indication for further radiological investigation. Significantly, her laboratory test results revealed 2 commonly noted abnormalities, including lymphopenia and an elevated creatine kinase level [6] [7] [8] . Although the full extent of serologic cross-reactivity to other viruses remains the subject of continuing research, our patient is unlikely to represent a false-positive case, because the antibodies that were detected in the patient neutralized the SARS coronavirus in vitro.",
