            "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 has emerged as a significant global concern, triggering harsh public health restrictions in a successful bid to curb its exponential growth. As discussion shifts towards relaxation of these restrictions, there is significant concern of second-wave resurgence. The key to managing these outbreaks is early detection and intervention, and yet there is significant lag time associated with usage of laboratory confirmed cases for surveillance purposes. To address this, syndromic surveillance can be considered to provide a timelier alternative for first-line screening. Existing syndromic surveillance solutions are however typically focused around a known disease and have limited capability to distinguish between outbreaks of individual diseases sharing similar syndromes. This poses a challenge for surveillance of COVID-19 as its active periods are tend to overlap temporally with other influenza-like illnesses. In this study we explore performing sentinel syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses using a deep learning-based approach. Our methods are based on aberration detection utilizing autoencoders that leverages symptom prevalence distributions to distinguish outbreaks of two ongoing diseases that share similar syndromes, even if they occur concurrently. We first demonstrate that this approach works for detection of outbreaks of influenza, which has known temporal boundaries. We then demonstrate that the autoencoder can be trained to not alert on known and wellmanaged influenza-like illnesses such as the common cold and influenza. Finally, we applied our approach to 2019-2020 data in the context of a COVID-19 syndromic surveillance task to demonstrate how implementation of such a system could have provided early warning of an outbreak of a novel influenza-like illness that did not match the symptom prevalence profile of influenza and other known influenza-like illnesses.",

To limit the spread of the disease, various public health restrictions have been deployed to great effect, but as of May 2020, international discussion has begun shifting towards relaxation of these restrictions. A key concern is, however, any subsequent resurgence of the disease 4-6 , particularly given that the disease has already become endemic within localized regions of the world 7 . This issue further exacerbated by significant undertesting, where estimates have found that more than 65% of infections were undocumented 8, 9 . Additionally, increasing levels of resistance and non-adherence to these restrictions has greatly increased resurgence risk.",

While the situation has been substantially improved, a resurgent outbreak will present much the same threat 11 . Indeed, second-wave resurgence has already been observed in Hokkaido Japan after public health restrictions were relaxed, and these restrictions were re-imposed a mere month after being lifted 12 . Additionally, from a healthcare provider perspective, significant nosocomial transmission rates for the disease have been found despite precautions [13] [14] [15] , a significant concern as many of the risk factors in terms of severity and mortality for COVID-19 2,16 can be commonly found within an in-hospital population. To avoid placing an even greater burden on already strained hospital resources, it is important that healthcare institutions respond promptly to any outbreaks and modify admission criteria for non-emergency cases appropriately. For both reasons, it is critical to detect outbreaks as early as possible so as to contain them prior to requiring reinstitution of these extensive public health restrictions.",

Reliance on laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases to perform surveillance introduces significant lag time after the beginning of the potential shedding period as symptoms must first present themselves 17, 18 and be sufficiently severe to warrant further investigation, before test results are received. This is further complicated by limited test reliability, with RT-PCR tests having an estimated sensitivity of 71% 19 , and serological tests, despite having high reported specificity, having significant false positive rates due to the relatively low prevalence of COVID-19 amongst the population. Moreover, asymptomatic carriers, which in some studies have been found to reach as much as 50-75% of the actual case population 20-22 , present significant risk, particularly amongst the healthcare provider population.",

The best performing model from training was selected, and the anomaly threshold was determined as the mean + 2 standard deviations of the reported errors derived from the test partition resulting from crossvalidation of the normal (training) time periods, with errors higher than this value being deemed anomalous.",

This anomaly does, in fact, exist in reality, but is not tied to a renewed outbreak of influenza-like illness.

For our purposes we used a 5-layer fully-connected stacked autoencoder consisting of [INPUT_DIM, 14, 12, 14, INPUT_DIM] nodes in each respective layer, where INPUT_DIM refers to the dimensionality of the input data. For influenza detection, this was 16 (excluding influenza prevalence), and for all other tasks, this was 17. The activation function used for all layers was the sigmoid activation function, except for the output layer, which used the identity function, with all inputs being rescaled to the [-1, 1] range. The optimization function used, their associated learning rate, and the l2 regularization penalty was selected via five-fold cross-validation, where optimization function was one of AdaDelta 64 , AdaGrad 65 , or traditional stochastic gradient descent 66 and their respective learning rate was selected from 100 randomly sampled points from the range [0.0001, 0.01], with the exception of AdaDelta, as it is an adaptive learning rate algorithm, and we instead used the recommended default rho and epsilon of 0.95 and 0.000001 respectively. An L2 regularization penalty 67 was selected from 100 random samples in the range [0.00001, 0.001]. The cost function used was mean squared error. For all model training tasks, training was done using the entire train dataset as one batch, over 1000 epochs utilizing early stopping (5 iterations with score improvement < 0.0001) and selecting the model resulting from the epoch that had the best performance against the test dataset. Evaluating Influenza Season Detection Capabilities For training purposes, we used seasonal date ranges as defined in the US CDC released morbidity and mortality weekly report (MMWR) and selected flu offseason for the odd-numbered years between 2010 and 2018 as our training set 40-47 . Specifically, the date ranges used for training were [2011-05-22, 2011-10-02), [2013-05-19,2013-09-29), [2015-05-23, 2015-10-04), and [2017-05-20, 2017-10-01).",
