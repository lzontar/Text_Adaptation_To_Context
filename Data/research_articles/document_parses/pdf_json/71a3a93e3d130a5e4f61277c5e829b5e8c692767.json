            "text": "The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of respiratory viruses associated with severe pneumonia among children less than 2 years of age in the rural district of Matiari in Sindh, Pakistan. This study was a community-based prospective cohort active surveillance of infants enrolled at birth and followed for 2 years. Cases were identified using the World Health Organization's Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses' definition of severe pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for assessment by multiplex RT-PCR for eight viruses and their subtypes, including RSV, influenza virus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus/ rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus. Blood cultures were collected from febrile participants. A total of 817 newborns were enrolled and followed with fortnightly surveillance for 2 years, accounting for a total of 1,501 childyears of follow-up. Of the nasopharyngeal swabs collected, 77.8% (179/230) were positive for one or more of the above mentioned respiratory viruses. The incidence of laboratory confirmed viral-associated pneumonia was 11.9 per 100 child-years of follow-up. Enterovirus/rhinovirus was detected in 51.7% patients, followed by parainfluenza virus type III (8.3%), and RSV (5.7%). Of the uncontaminated blood cultures, 1.4% (5/356) were positive. Respiratory viruses are frequently detected during acute respiratory infection episodes in children under 2 years old in a rural community in Pakistan. However, causal association is yet to be established and the concomitant role of bacteria as a co-infection or super-infection needs further investigation.",

In 2011, 1.3 million episodes of pneumonia were fatal in children under 5 years of age Walker et al., 2013] . Pakistan is one of the 15 countries in the world that accounts for more than 60% of the worldwide disease burden of pneumonia [Liu et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2013] . Although developing countries such as Pakistan have the greatest burden of pneumonia, national data available on epidemiology and etiology of pneumonia is based on studies published over 2 decades ago [Selwyn, 1990] . Since then, diagnostic modalities and treatments have evolved. Widespread introduction of several vaccines in national immunization programs has reduced and modified the current etiologies of infectious diseases, including etiologies of pneumonia [Measham et al., 2006; Theodoratou et al., 2010] . The modern nucleic acid based molecular diagnostic methods can capture viral respiratory pathogens and with greater specificity and sensitivity than previously possible [Weinberg et al., 2004; Mahony, 2008; Caliendo, 2011] .",

It is the first study in Pakistan to utilize molecular diagnostic tests to prospectively determine the burden and seasonality of multiple respiratory viruses including coronaviruses, enterovirus/ rhinovirus, and human bocavirus in community setting. In this study population, the incidence of laboratory confirmed viral-associated severe pneumonia in children <2 years old was 11.9 episodes per 100 child-years, which was considerably lower than the detection rate reported in a study conducted on inpatient and outpatient wards of children less than 5 years old in rural Kenya (56 cases per 100 childyears) with active community surveillance [Feikin et al., 2012] . However, the number of pneumonia episodes recorded in our study was higher than that reported from a hospital-based study with active population surveillance conducted in rural Bangladesh (50.5 hospitalizations per 100,000 patient-weeks) [Nasreen et al., 2014] . Comparisons are limited due to differences in methodologies and populations being studied. Within this age group, children less than 6 months old had the highest incidence of viral-associated pneumonia. Therefore, the highest number of NP swabs was collected from participants in this age group and the highest number of positive samples was detected in this age group. As the age of the cohort increased, the incidence of viral-associated ARIs declined. This finding corresponds to a birth cohort study conducted in periurban South Africa that also found that children younger than 6 months old are most vulnerable to pneumonia [le Roux et al., 2015] .",

Although Pakistan introduced pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 10) in October 2012 in its Expanded Programme for Immunization, the limited rollout at that time was unlikely to affect subsequent bacterial detection in this study; the overall impact of the limited rollout of the pneumococcal vaccine in Pakistan is still under investigation [GAVI, 2012; Ali, 2014] .",

This study was a community-based surveillance conducted in a rural area of Pakistan, as opposed to most other studies of pneumonia etiology that have been hospital-based and/or conducted in urban settings. This study helps bridge the gap since the 1980s' Board of Science and Technology for International Development (BOSTID) studies determining the epidemiology of ARIs, which included surveillance in Pakistan albeit in a different region [Selwyn, 1990] . Limitations of this study include its observational cohort design as opposed to a casecontrol study, which makes it difficult to determine whether these viruses are truly responsible for the symptoms, or whether they are detectable in healthy children as well in that area. Viral detection does not necessarily have a causal association with acute illness. Presence of respiratory viruses in controls has been reported in many other similar studies in the literature, and lack of viral testing from asymptomatic children in our study is a limitation [Mathisen et al., 2010; Singleton et al., 2010; Feikin et al., 2012; Hammitt et al., 2012] . The Luminex assay used in this study, similar to most other commercial assays was unable to distinguish between enterovirus and rhinovirus, hence, the results were grouped together as enterovirus/rhinovirus.",

Respiratory viruses are frequently detected at the time of these pneumonia episodes, though causal association cannot be established based on this study. The role of bacterial co-infections in these cases cannot be completely ruled out.
