Methods: Changes in human lung EC monolayer permeability were assessed by Transendothelial Electrical Resistance (TER) in response to PM challenge (collected from Ft. McHenry Tunnel, Baltimore, MD, particle size >0.1 \u03bcm). Biochemical assessment of ROS generation and Ca 2+ mobilization were also measured. Results: PM exposure induced tight junction protein Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) relocation from the cell periphery, which was accompanied by significant reductions in ZO-1 protein levels but not in adherens junction proteins (VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin). N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC, 5 mM) reduced PM-induced ROS generation in ECs, which further prevented TER decreases and atteneuated ZO-1 degradation. PM also mediated intracellular calcium mobilization via the transient receptor potential cation channel M2 (TRPM2), in a ROS-dependent manner with subsequent activation of the Ca 2+ -dependent protease calpain. PM-activated calpain is responsible for ZO-1 degradation and EC barrier disruption. Overexpression of ZO-1 attenuated PM-induced endothelial barrier disruption and vascular hyperpermeability in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that PM induces marked increases in vascular permeability via ROS-mediated calcium leakage via activated TRPM2, and via ZO-1 degradation by activated calpain. These findings support a novel mechanism for PM-induced lung damage and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.",

Exposure of airway epithelium to airborne PM causes altered cytokine/chemokine gene expression and increased production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 [5, 6] . Now, the lung endothelium is also gaining attention as a viable PM target tissue. Exposure of the endothelium to PM or its active components in the systemic circulation induces significant systemic endothelial inflammation and dysfunction, even at low levels of exposure [7, 8] . The water soluble fraction of PM (up to 35-50%) can easily diffuse through the epithelium/endothelial barrier to the systemic circulation. Bioavailable transition metals present in urban PM catalyze redox reactions in human lung endothelium, which cause oxidative stress, increase the production of inflammatory cytokines, and increase the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, all of which trigger further endothelial damage [9] . Increased endothelial monolayer permeability is also observed in inflammatory pulmonary conditions such as acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis; devastating lung disorders with mortality exceeding 30%, as well as in more subacute and chronic inflammatory disorders such as asthma [10, 11] .",

By assessment of direct effects on endothelial barrier integrity in vitro, we further demonstrated that the vascular hyperpermeability mediated by intratracheal PM exposure is mainly dependent on acute endothelial barrier disruption by PM [13] . Exposure of human lung EC to PM resulted in significant ROS generation, which mediates p38beta MAPK activation, leading to the phosphorylation of HSP27 [13] . Phosphorylated HSP27 facilitates the synthesis of stress fibers and formation of paracellular gaps, which causes protein-containing fluid to leak from the microvessel lumen to the lung alveoli, leading to further pulmonary inflammation [13] . However, these previous findings did not explain the persistent character of PM-mediated endothelial barrier disruption.",

These results increase our understanding of PM-induced adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes. Moreover, as the newly characterized signaling cascade of ROS/TRPM2/Calpain/ ZO-1 likely has fundamental roles in regulating the cytoskeleton under oxidative stress, these novel observations may have broad applicability to vascular pathophysiology in a variety of cell types.",

EC pretreatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC, 5 mM, 1 hr), an ROS scavenger, or PEG-catalase (PEG-CAT, 250 U/ml, 1 hr), which degrades H 2 O 2 , prevented PM-induced DCFDA oxidation by ROS (Additional file 1: Figure S4 ). PM produced a sustained timedependent decrease in TER, with a maximal effect observed at 100 \u03bcg/ml (80% decrease in TER), which is similar to its effects on other endothelial cell types, as we have reported previously [13] . NAC pretreatment (5 mM, 1 hr pretreatment) prevented PM-induced ZO-1 degradation ( Figure 1B ), while NAC (5 mM, 1-24 hr) does not change ZO-1 protein levels by itself (Additional file 1: Figure S5 ). After ECs were treated with PM (100 \u03bcg/ml, 6 hr), ZO-1 was relocated from the cell periphery and degraded, which was followed by gap formation between ECs. VE-cadherin, on the other hand, underwent no relocation or degradation ( Figure 1C ). NAC pretreatment (5 mM, 1 hr pretreatment) prevented PM-induced ZO-1 relocation and gap formation ( Figure 1C ). These data strongly indicate that PM causes EC barrier disruption selectively via oxidative tight junction protein degradation. NAC (5 mM) or PEG-CAT (250 U/ml) pretreatment significantly inhibited PM-induced EC barrier disruption as measured by TER ( Figure 1D ). We also examined the effects of another ROS scavenger EUK-134 on PMchallenged ECs. As NAC, EUK (5 \u03bcM, 1 hr pretreatment) attenuated PM-induced ZO-1 degradation and TER reduction (Additional file 1: Figure S6 ).

Notably, this finding of increased intracellular Ca 2+ is in accordance with our previous finding of increased activated calpain.

            "text": "A PM-mediated murine model of pulmonary inflammation has been well established [12] . We investigated the role of ROS and calpain in PM-induced pulmonary inflammation by examining protein leakage, white blood cell infiltration (inflammatory leukocytes), and the release of proinflammatory cytokines into BAL fluids ( Figure 5 ). Pre-administration of NAC (150 mg/kg) or calpeptin (1 mg/kg) 1 hr before PM challenge (10 mg/kg, 24 hr) significantly attenuated PM-induced protein leakage into BAL fluids (~50% reduction, Figure 5A ). PM challenge (10 mg/kg, 24 hr) resulted in an increase in inflammatory leukocytes, e.g. neutrophils and eosinophils [12, 15] , in BAL fluids ( Figure 5B ). Pre-administration of NAC (150 mg/kg) or calpeptin (1 mg/kg) attenuated PMinduced inflammatory leukocyte infiltration. Furthermore, NAC (150 mg/kg) or calpeptin (1 mg/kg) attenuated the release of PM-induced proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and THF-\u03b1 into BAL (~50% inhibition, Figure 5C-D) . These results suggest that ROS scavenging by NAC or Figure 2 Activated calpain is required for PM-mediated ZO-1 degradation and EC barrier disruption. (A) Human lung microvascular ECs grown in 60-mm dishes to approximately 95% confluence were treated with ALLN (30 \u03bcM), calpeptin (CALP, 10 \u03bcM), NAC (5 mM), or BAPTA-AM (50 \u03bcM) for 1 hr, and then challenged with PM (100 \u03bcg/ml) for 1 hr. Cell lysates were subjected to calpain activity assay by using the calpain activity kit (Calbiochem). Calpain activity was normalized to protein concentration and expressed as fold changed compared to control. *p < 0.05 compared to control. **p < 0.05 compared to PM only group. (B) ECs grown on ECIS gold electrodes were treated with ALLN (30 \u03bcM), calpeptin (CALP, 10 \u03bcM) for 1 hr, and then challenged with PM (100 \u03bcg/ml). Changes in TER were measured with ECIS. *p < 0.05 compared to PM only group. (C) ECs grown on 6-well plates were treated with ALLN (30 \u03bcM), calpeptin (CALP, 10 \u03bcM), or BAPTA-AM (50 \u03bcM) for 1 hr, and challenged with PM (100 \u03bcg/ml) for 1-6 hr. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibody to ZO-1. Changes in levels of ZO-1 are expressed as fold changes and normalized to \u03b2-actin. Shown are representative blots from three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 compared to PM-1 hr group. **p < 0.05 compared to PM-6 hr group. calpain activity inhibition by calpeptin leads to multiple protective effects including enhancement of lung endothelial barrier function, reduction of inflammatory cell infiltration, and prevention of proinflammatory cytokine release in the lungs of PM-challenged mice. We next examined tight junction ZO-1 levels in the PM-exposed lung. PM challenge (10 mg/kg, 24 hr) induced a significant reduction of ZO-1 protein levels in the murine lung, while pre-administration of NAC (150 mg/kg) or calpeptin (1 mg/kg) 1 hr before PM challenge attenuated PMinduced ZO-1 loss from lung tissues. Taken together, these data suggest a crucial role for the ROS-calpain-ZO-1 signaling pathway in the regulation of EC barrier disregulation in PM-mediated pulmonary inflammation.",

ZO-1 over-expression ( Figure 6A ) significantly (but not completely) attenuated PM-induced EC barrier disruption ( Figure 6B ). These facts demonstrate that endothelial ZO-1 loss contributes to PM-mediated EC barrier disruption. We next over-expressed ZO-1 in vivo by a liposome delivery system labeled with ACE antibody, which successfully over-expressed ZO-1 in Human lung microvascular ECs were plated on glass cover slips and loaded with 5 \u03bcM Fura-2 AM in 1 ml of basic medium.

The high iron level of this particular PM might also contribute to the ROS generated via Fenton reactions. ROS released endogenously, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several lung diseases, including asthma and COPD, as the biochemical mechanisms underlying the urban PM-induced airway inflammation and toxicity [29] . ROS are highly reactive and cause deleterious gene, protein, and tissue effects. ROS are increased in BAL or exhaled breath condensate from patients with inflammatory lung injuries and from people with cardiopulmonary disease who have been exposed to PM [30, 31] . This response may reflect the high oxidative potential of fine and ultrafine particulates. Residual oil fly ash (ROFA) and PM1.7-3.5 cause pulmonary inflammation mediated by oxidative stress [32, 33] . In vivo, exposing rats to PM leads to the formation of free radicals in the lung [34] . Since cardiovascular disease is considered a risk factor of PMrelated mortality and morbidity, it is interesting to note that spontaneously hypertensive rats, when exposed to PM, were more susceptible to pulmonary (inflammatory injury) and cardiovascular complications (acute depression of ECG activity) in an oxidant-dependent manner [35] . Besides ROS, PM might trigger adverse outcomes via other potential mechanisms including nonselective phosphatase inhibition (by vanadium) or competitive ion channel inhibition (by nickel) due to the complex and variable chemical components.",

Tight junctions, or zonula occludens, are the most apical component of the intercellular junctional complex, which also includes adherens junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions [36] . ZO-1 was the first tight junction protein to be identified, and ZO-2 and ZO-3 were later isolated as proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with ZO-1 [37, 38] . ZO-1 is a peripheral membrane-associated component of the cytoplasmic plaque of tight junctions and is found ubiquitously within tight junctions of epithelial and endothelial cells [39] . ZO-1 interacts with many cellular proteins via its multiple protein-binding domains. ZO-1 has been reported to interact with other ZO family members or claudins via the PDZ domains [40, 41] . ZO-1 interacts with the C-terminus of occludin with its GuK domain and the acidic domain [42] . The proline-rich C-terminus of ZO-1 mediates its binding to F-actin in vitro, and thus links it to the cytoskeleton [43] . Clearly, ZO-1 interacts with a wide variety of cell skeleton components and plays a central role in orchestrating tight junction complexes. Any dysregulation of ZO-1 in endothelial cells by extracellular stimuli, such as virus shell proteins or alcohol, leads to persistent tight junction disruption and vascular hyperpermeability.",

Under oxidative stress, activated calpain cleaves eNOS and cytoskeletal proteins and induces apoptosis [21, [46] [47] [48] . Particulate matter induces endothelial cell intracellular oxidative stress, which leads to the activation of calpain, one of the major cytoskeletal regulators. Here we describe the cleavage of tight junction protein ZO-1 by activated calpain both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that calpain plays a central role in PM-induced endothelial barrier disruption and vascular hyperpermeability. In addition, as activated calpain cleaves other critical cytoskeletal proteins including ezrin and MARCKS protein, the contribution of the other cytoskeletal proteins to the EC hyperpermeability induced by PM needs to be further investigated.",

TRPM2, a member of the TRP channel M2 subtype, is a calcium-permeable channel activated by intracellular messengers such as ADP-ribose [50] . Massive ROS burden induced by PM contributes to DNA oxidation and damage, which activates poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) to initiate DNA repair mechanisms. PARP binds to single-stranded and double-stranded DNA breaks and catalyses the breakdown of NAD into nicotinamide and ADPribose, the intracellular agonist of TRPM2 [22, 51, 52] . Oxidative stress-mediated activation of the PARP pathway serves as the major source of free ADP-ribose production in endothelial cells [53] . Intracellular ADP-ribose activates TRPM2, allowing calcium ions to enter the cell, which in turn trigger numerous physiological and pathological processes.",

With 10-30 \u03bcg/m 3 ambient PM level in the US or Europe, it is hardly to achieve a high level of acute PM exposure. While 100 \u03bcg/ml (in vitro) or 10 mg/kg (in vivo) are typical doses used in particulate matter toxicology studies [12, 13, 27, [54] [55] [56] . With an assumed ambient PM level of 20 \u03bcg/m 3 , one man with 70 kg body weight and 8 m 3 /minute respiration rate would receive a dose of 10 mg/kg corresponding to about 16 years of exposure with 50% deposition rate. As noted, a lot of cities in the developing countries still have high levels of ambient PM. A report by world bank [57] Extensive epidemiologic and experimental evidence has demonstrated that particulate air pollution directly causes cardiopulmonary damage. Our observations demonstrate a novel mechanism of PM-mediated disruption of endothelial barrier function which is attributable to ZO-1 degradation by calpain, which is activated by extracellular calcium leakage through oxidant-sensitive TRPM2 channels. Therefore, inhibition of ROS/TRPM2/calpain/ZO-1 degradation may provide useful therapeutic strategies for the treatment of endothelial barrier dysfunction and lung inflammation.",
