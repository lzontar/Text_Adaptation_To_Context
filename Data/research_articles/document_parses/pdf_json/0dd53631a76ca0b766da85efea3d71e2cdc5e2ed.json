Supply and equipment shortages are already a daunting reality in many hospitals and imminent for others. Over the coming months, the projected intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity gap in the USA ranges from 90,000 to 300,000, depending on infection rates and the success of social distancing and other measures to 'flatten the curve' [1, 2] . This is in excess of all available ICU beds, including those typically allocated to critically ill patients with stroke and other neurological diseases. In addition to material and equipment shortages, health-care personnel are becoming increasingly stretched as the pandemic continues, with neurology providers and nurses being repurposed or re-assigned, and others temporarily dropping out of the work-force for illness, self-isolation after exposure, or after becoming infected themselves.",

Safe low-intensity monitoring of some post-IVT patients would not only allow for cost-effective resource utilization, but also free up resources for patients with more urgent need for intensive monitoring and care, such as critically ill COVID-19 patients. Efforts by us and others to promote appropriate resource allocation for stable post-IVT stroke patients have preceded the COVID-19 era [7] [8] [9] , but have gained additional relevance over the last few months. Herein, we share our protocol for a subpopulation of post-IVT patients that may be safely monitored in a low-intensity resource environment based on preliminary results of the previously published proof-of-concept Optimal Post Tpa-Iv Monitoring in Ischemic STroke (OPTIMIST) study [7] , and our upcoming definitive clinical trial and registry funded prior to the emergence of COVID-19. We summarize the current evidence for our protocol, discuss the protocol in detail, and call for participation in a clinical trial, OPTI-MISTmain, and registry, OPTIMISTregistry. ",

Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) is the most feared complication of this therapy, harboring the risk of early neurological deterioration and mortality. Thus, clinical practice guidelines recommend that post-IVT patients are closely monitored over at least 24 h to allow prevention and early detection of sICH, neurological deterioration, and other complications [10] . Post-IVT patients are commonly admitted to an ICU depending on institutional protocols, but regardless of physical patient location, current standard monitoring protocol requires 1:1 or 1:2 nursing in order to provide the recommended frequency of vital sign checks and neurological assessments: every 15 min for the first 2 h, then every 30 min for the next 6 h, and thereafter every hour up to the 24 h mark [11] . This monitoring schedule was derived from the pivotal National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) stroke trial [12, 13] , developed in the context of the initial cautious evaluation of IVT for acute stroke in the early 1990s. It has since been adopted into clinical practice by consensus and convention and has hitherto remained largely unchallenged. Yet, it is unclear whether this standard of highly intensive nursing monitoring should continue to be routinely applied to stable post-IVT patients with mild neurological deficits, who have no critical care needs and are otherwise deemed low risk for complications.",

            "text": "Over the two decades since regulatory approval of tPA, clinical experience, registries, and further trials have established IVT as a relatively safe treatment modality in AIS. Indeed, real-world sICH rates of 2-7% are generally reported, and only a relatively small fraction of patients experience additional early neurological deterioration [14] [15] [16] . Stroke severity, measured on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), is one of the strongest predictors of sICH and subsequent need for critical care of post-IVT patients. In a pooled analysis of patients from multiple IVT trials, the absolute risk of fatal type 2 parenchymal ICH [17] related to IVT increased from 1.6% with a baseline NIHSS score of 5 to 10, to 6.8% with an NIHSS score > 21 [18] . Similarly, post-IVT patients with an NIHSS score \u2265 10 have almost 8 times higher odds of requiring critical care interventions compared to patients with a NIHSS < 10 [8, 19] . In addition, timing matters: most sICH occurs in the first few hours after IVT [20] , and regardless of this risk, most post-IVT patients who need critical care (i.e., due to malignant hypertension, difficulty in protecting their airway, etc.) during the first 24 h generally declare themselves by the end of the tPA infusion [8] . Among patients with mild-moderate neurological deficit (NIHSS < 10) who do not require critical care after the tPA infusion is completed, less than 1% subsequently require ICU care. All these data suggest that post-IVT care does not have to be a 'one-size-fits-all' approach and that NIHSS combined with time can identify a subpopulation of post-IVT patients with low risk of complications.",

The protocol is identical to the current standard in the first two hours after administration of the tPA bolus, that is, vital sign checks and neurological assessments every 15 min for the first 2 h. Thereafter, patients can be transferred to a non-critical care environment, such as a telemetry-monitored acute stroke unit or comparable destination unit capable of caring for stroke patients. Monitoring under the lowintensity protocol commences after the first 2 h and is provided regardless of physical patient location. The protocol is comprised of vital sign checks and neurological assessment on admission (arrival) to the destination unit, then 1 h after admission, then every 2 h for another 8 h, followed by vital sign checks and neurological assessments every 4 h until 24-h post-IVT period is complete.",

In OPTI-MIST, we included 35 AIS patients who received IVT under standard guideline-recommended criteria, if they had an NIHSS < 10 and did not have a clinical need for ICU care at the end of the tPA infusion. Patients were monitored via our low-intensity protocol in a telemetry stroke unit without critical or intermediate care capabilities with a nurse-to-patient ratio of 1:3. There were no serious adverse events, no patients that required critical care, and the median 90-day NIHSS and modified Rankin Scale scores (mRS) were 0. However, generalizability must be cautioned given the small sample size.",

The objectives are to reliably determine whether low-intensity post-IVT monitoring is clinically non-inferior and economically beneficial, relative to standard of care monitoring. The stepped-wedge cluster randomized design was chosen to avoid contamination of the randomized intervention across patients, and to facilitate hospital-wide implementation and adherence to protocol procedures. Sites (hospitals) with an established acute stroke program, a geographically defined area dedicated to stroke care such as an acute stroke unit, and the ability to implement the low-intensity monitoring protocol are eligible for participation. All sites will be randomly allocated to one of three groups to recruit groups of patients, moving from control to intervention of the low-intensity monitoring protocol as part of routine clinical practice (see Supplemental File).",

In addition to excluding patients with critical care needs, those perceived to be at highrisk of further neurological or medical deterioration are to be excluded. Patients who receive EVT after IVT may be included provided they otherwise fulfill the inclusion criteria. Patients who do not meet inclusion criteria are monitored as per the current standard. The low-intensity monitoring protocol in OPTIMISTmain is identical to that of the original OPTIMIST protocol, but without the need for vital sign check and neurological assessment at the 3-h mark; this is to streamline protocol implementation. In OPTIMISTmain, the low-intensity monitoring protocol diverges from the standard monitoring protocol at 1 h after IVT completion (2 h after IVT bolus) and includes vital sign checks and neurological assessments every 2 h for 8 h, followed by vital sign checks and neurological assessments every 4 h until completion of the 24-h post-IVT period (Fig. 1) . Figure 2 depicts the OPTIMISTmain monitoring protocol for bedside implementation. The primary outcome is an ordinal shift in functional recovery according to the mRS scores at 90 days. Secondary outcomes include sICH, NIHSS at Day 7, length of hospital stay, and health economic indicators. The OPTIMISTmain protocol synopsis is attached as a supplement. OPTIMISTmain involves a staged roll-out with a start-up phase including 20 sites in the USA; an additional 100 sites outside the USA, including sites in Australia, South America, and the UK, are intended to follow shortly after the US roll-out. The US portion of the trial is funded by Genentech.",
