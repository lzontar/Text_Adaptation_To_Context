However, pandemics like the COVID-2019 provides a dilemma and an ethical challenge because of limited resources and elevated risks of infections in treating with evidence-based practice. Such times demand appropriate treatment decisions that require a careful balance of patient benefits and associated risks. This warrants the need to look into phase II trials, prospective evidence and also some retrospective series. The harm associated with COVID infection in cancer patients has been presented by a simple model by Simcock, et al. (7). If a patient has a 5% risk of infection and a 10% risk of death from infection there may be a 0.5% mortality through exposure and attendance for radiotherapy. If the patient is young and healthy with a 5% risk of infection and a 1% risk of death, then there is a 0.05% mortality from COVID-19. The use of chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy is likely to significantly increase the risk of morbidity and mortality from synchronous COVID-19 infection.

            "text": "Radiation therapy for patients with breast cancer contributes to a significant proportion of the workload in any radiation oncology department. Knowledge about priorities and exercising these to decrease unnecessary patient visits will significantly impact radiation facility resources. In the present resource strained COVID-19 pandemic situation, it is important to prioritize patients and consider low-risk situations where delaying/de-escalating or omitting treatment may not be so detrimental yet save resources for other more pressing indications. It has been an acceptable treatment option for more than a decade now. APBI can be offered to women with infiltrating ductal carcinoma over 60 years, tumor size up to 2 cms, node-negative, ER+, no LVSI, and clear margins. Target volume includes the surgical cavity with a margin. APBI can be delivered through balloon brachytherapy, interstitial brachytherapy, and external beam radiation therapy. However, in the present COVID-19 pandemic, it is advisable to do using external beam radiation therapy using 3DCRT or IMRT/VMAT as brachytherapy would require additional resources and also would lead to unnecessary exposure and hospital stay. It may also increase the risk of transmission during intubations or upper endoscopic procedures and necessitate increased PPE while they are in short supply. Regimens include 30 Gy in 5 fractions every other day (Florence regimen), 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions, twice daily and 40 Gy in 10 daily fractions, amongst some others. In the present COVID-19 pandemic, a shift to APBI for eligible patients will drastically relieve the radiation service resources and there are institutions and countries releasing documents in its favor amidst the pandemic (26). C. Post-mastectomy and regional nodal radiation therapy: There is an ongoing trial investigating the omission of post-mastectomy chest wall and regional nodal radiation in patients with cT1-3 N1 disease who have ypN0 status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery. However, until the results are published, the omission is not recommended outside of a clinical trial. Post-mastectomy chest wall radiation can be delivered with hypofractionation in 15 fractions with non-inferior outcomes and similar toxicity. (27). There is also preliminary literature suggesting hypofractionated 15-16 fraction regimens for regional nodes. There is evidence building up even for the 5 fractionated regimen. However, with the current literature, 15 fractions are safe. D. Cardiac sparing methods: Several radiation oncology centers use cardiac sparing deep inspiratory breath-hold techniques especially in left breast cancers for better cardiac sparing. There are advised caution against the use of active breathing control devices that involve the use of a mouthpiece as that involves a risk of viral transmission as the major mode of transmission is coming into contact with secretion droplets. Techniques that involve voluntary breath-hold to achieve the desired effect are recommended. Treatment in a prone position can be an option to reduce cardiac dose, though it can be a little cumbersome procedure. E. Miscellaneous: Intra-operative radiation therapy can be an option as this will obviate any further need for visiting the hospital for radiation therapy. It is delivered over 20-45 minutes to the tumor bed. The surface of the bed typically receives 20 Gy that attenuates to 5-7 Gy at 1 cm depth. There are studies to support its use. Although not adopted universally in practice, it might be a very reasonable option, if available, in the COVID-19 pandemic where reduced hospital visits and social distancing is an important strategy to prevent/reduce infection. F. Prioritizing of radiation therapy: Braunstein et al from MSKCC (28) has proposed an informative tier system for prioritizing radiation services in breast cancer patients during this COVID-19 pandemic. The details are shown in Table 1 .",

As the pulmonary reserve may be affected by cancer, with the superseding risk of COVID-19 infection capable of producing severe manifestations in them, patient selection for treatment is key. Also, sequential treatments over concurrent treatments may be preferred keeping in mind the long-term goal of successful treatment completion. Management as per the stage of the disease is discussed in Table 2 . Additional points to be considered: a) Breath hold devices are indicated in lung SBRT.

It is vital to explain to patients the benefit of radiotherapy balanced against the accepted risk associated with contracting COVID-19 during the treatment period. These new protocols will have to be accepted as the 'new normal' and set in place as there is a high likelihood that the pandemic may last for several months. We have attempted to bring together guidelines from all over the world under one roof to help clinicians make a well-planned decision related to radiation therapy. The guidelines are ever-evolving and the structured plans depicted in the article may change with potential developments in the future.",

No concurrent chemotherapy should be given. \u2022 Radical or boost treatment with brachytherapy is not encouraged as theatres and anesthesia should be conserved for high volumes of cervix and endometrial brachytherapy.D.
