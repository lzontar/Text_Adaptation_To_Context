The epidemic evolution is modeled using an individual dynamic where transitions are mathematically defined by chain binomial and multinomial processes to preserve the discrete and stochastic nature of the transmission and disease evolution process. Each subpopulation's disease dynamic is coupled with the other subpopulations through the mechanistically simulated travel and commuting patterns of disease carriers. Within each sub-population, the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is modeled using a compartmental representation of the disease where individuals can occupy one of the following compartments: Susceptible (S), Latent (L), Infectious (I) and Recovered (R). Susceptible individuals can acquire the virus through contacts with individuals in the infectious compartment, and become latent, meaning they are infected but can not transmit the disease yet. Latent individuals progress to the infectious stage with a rate inversely proportional to the latent period (which we assume to have the same duration as the incubation period), and infectious individuals progress into the removed stage with a rate inversely proportional to the infectious period. The sum of the mean latent and infectious periods defines the generation time. Removed individuals represent those who can no longer infect others, meaning they are recovered, isolated, hospitalized, or dead. The model works in discrete time steps, representing a full day, to implement computationally the air travel, the compartmental transitions (where the force of infection takes into account both the infection dynamics and the shortrange movement of individuals), and the partial aggregation of the results at the desired level of geographic resolution. All the technical details of the model have been previously published (2; 5). The model is fully stochastic and for each nominally identical initialization (initial conditions and disease model) generates an ensemble of possible epidemic evolutions for epidemic observables, such as newly generated cases, time of arrival of the infection, and number of traveling carriers. Parameter ranges for the latent and infectious period, and generation time are derived from early estimates on the epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, as well as plausible ranges from the SARS epidemic (6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11).

This allows us to calculate the distribution P (D) for the evidence D, and for each value of R 0 , the likelihood P (D|R 0 ). From these distributions we can calculate the posterior probability P (R 0 |D) of interest (see Fig. 1B) ). The evidence D is the observation of imported 2019-nCoV cases to international locations, with a 25% excess tolerance provided by the fact that no exact location on the importation is imposed and we consider a time window 01/16/2020 to 01/23/2020, corresponding with publicly available data before the travel ban.

While the model predicts twice the number of cases on this date, the number of detected cases is comparable to the model used in the main text. The travel ban in Wuhan also had a similar effect on the total reduction of cases. By February 22, the model projects an overall detected case reduction of 20% in areas of Mainland China excluding Wuhan. In addition, the travel ban only delays the epidemic by approximately 3 days.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sensitivity Analysis"}, {"text": "Using the model, we can also estimate the number of case importations in international locations. In Fig. 2A we report the mean number of total international importation events and the number of detected importation events. The detected cases account for approximately 50% of all cases. In addition to the initial travel ban occurring in Wuhan, we also study the effect of a general reduction in traffic between Mainland China and other countries due to travel restrictions put into place by countries and airline companies. Specifically, we study two scenarios where the overall airtraffic is reduced by 40% and 90%. Within each travel reduction scenario we also consider a reduction in the transmissibility of the disease due to behavioral changes or awareness about the disease. The relative reductions in transmissibility correspond to dampening factors of r=1 (no reduction), r=0.75 (25% reduction), and r = 0.50 (50% reduction). In Fig. 2B we show the combined effects of the travel and transmissibility reductions on the epidemic incidence in Mainland China. The peak of the epidemic is reached at the end of April for Mainland China and the last week in February for Wuhan in the absence of a transmissibility reduction. The number of detected cases imported to other countries, is initially affected by a tenfold reduction, but by March 1st 2020 when there is no transmissibility reduction (r=1), this number has reached again the levels of 248 and 44 cases per day for the 40% and 90% travel restrictions scenarios, respectively. The concurrent presence of both travel and transmissibility reductions, however, produce a much larger synergistic effect visible by both delaying the epidemic activity in Mainland China and the number of imported cases. In the moderate transmissibility reduction scenarios (r=0.75) the epidemic peak in Mainland China (excluding Wuhan) is delayed to the last week in May, 2020 and the total number of detected international case importations by March 1st 2020 are 38 and 7 cases per day for the 40% and 90% travel restrictions scenarios, respectively. Larger travel limitations (> 90%) will extend the period of time during which the importation of cases is greatly reduced. The relative reduction of 50% of the transmissibility (r = 0.5) along with travel restrictions does delay the epidemic growth in China that never surpasses the daily incidence of 1 case per 1,000 in Mainland China, and the number of imported cases at international destinations are always in the single digit range. The overall picture is consistent and very similar to the one presented in the main text.
