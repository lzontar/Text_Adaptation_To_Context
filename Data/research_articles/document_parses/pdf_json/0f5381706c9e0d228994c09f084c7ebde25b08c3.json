In this investigation, we extend different physical conditions of the growth by employing fractional calculus. We study a system of coupled differential equations, which describes the dynamics of the infection spreading between infected and asymptomatic styles. The healthy population properties are measured due to the social meeting. The result is associated with a macroscopic law for the population. This dynamic system is appropriate to describe the performance of growth rate of the infection and to verify if its control is appropriately employed. A unique solution, under self-mapping possessions, is investigated. Approximate solutions are presented by utilizing fractional integral of Chebyshev polynomials. Our methodology is based on the Atangana-Baleanu calculus, which provides various activity results in the simulation. We tested the suggested system by using live data. We found positive action in the graphs.",

This idea contains an important term, which is the exponential law to find and accept the graph of the growth.

The fundamental clarifications for applying fractional derivative illustrations are that various arrangements, constructions, and inequalities show the ability to remember past, or nonlocal properties, which cannot be stimulated using normal order derivatives. The fundamental ideas and applications of fractional calculus and fractional differential equations can now be found in many surveys. While most of the principal studies were based on the procedure of the Riemann-Liouville fractional order derivative, or the Caputo fractional order derivative, it has been observed that these derivatives have the property that their kernels have a singularity at the end of the interval of interest. The essential differences among the arbitrary derivatives are their unlike kernels which can be selected to fit the requirements of different applications. For example, the central variations between the Caputo fractional derivative, the Caputo-Fabrizio derivative [5] , and others are that the Caputo calculus is expressed by employing a power law, while the Caputo-Fabrizio derivative is characterized by using an exponential decay. Atangana-Baleanu operator is introduced by suggesting the generalized Mittag-Leffler function [6] .",

We consider the following dynamic system:By employing different approximations (20), in Fig. 1 we plot them depending on the statistics of the data. The approximate solution of (21), in the case of Spain and Italy, is (\u03d5 2 , \u03c8 2 ) = ( 2(t+2t 2 ) \u03c0 , 2(t+2t 2 ) \u03c0 ) for the connection constants C 0.5,2 = 0.0957 and C 0.5,2 = 0.0471, respectively. While the data of China indicate using (\u03d5 1 , \u03c8 1 ) = ( 2t+2 \u03c0 , 2t+2 \u03c0 ) with the maximum value of connection C 0.5,1 = 1. The information about USA recognizes rapidly increasing cases, therefore, we used the combined function of \u03d5 1 as follows: \u03d5 1 (t)(exp( \u03d5 1 (t)) -1) with connection value C 0.5,1 = 0.023. Note that the confirmed cases are measured in thousands, for example, in Spain, the number of confirmed cases in March was 95.9 K, while in April it was 236.899 K, therefore, the approximate solution is given by (\u03d5 4 , \u03c8 4 ). Figure 2 indicates the cases in Russia in March and April. The data show that in March the number of infections was very low (per person), but in April it was increasing rapidly (per K = 1000)",
