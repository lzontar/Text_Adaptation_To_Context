Methods The demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment, and prognosis from 15 cases of pSS-LIP patients were retrospectively analyzed. The data were compared with t test, \u03c7 2 test, and Pearson/Spearman correlation analysis. Results (1) Fifteen cases of patients with pSS-LIP are all females (100%). Compared with pSS with interstitial lung disease(pSS-ILD) patients, the incidence of dry cough, dental caries is higher in pSS-LIP patients. The incidence of shortness of breath, weight loss, and crackles is lower in pSS-LIP patients than that of pSS-ILD patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "(2) Compared with pSS-ILD patients, pSS-LIP patients had higher percentage of patients with ANA, anti-SSA52KD antibody, anti-SSA60KD antibody, and anti-SSB antibody, and the higher concentration of serum globulin. (3) Compared with pSS-ILD patients, the frequency of obstructive ventilation dysfunction is significantly higher and the frequency of diffusion dysfunction is significantly lower in pSS-LIP patients. (4) The most frequent HRCT findings in patients with pSS-LIP is cysts (100%), followed by ground-glass opacities (73.3%), nodular shadow (73.3%) among the pSS-LIP patients. Compared with PSS-ILD patients, the incidence of pulmonary nodule shadow is significantly higher in PSS-LIP patients, while that of grid shadow was significantly lower. (5) Compared with the baseline, the sum of the number, maximum diameter, and diameter of cysts in three levels of pSS-LIP patients showed an increasing trend after treatment. (6) Correlation analysis: The changes of ground-glass opacities were positively correlated with using GC or not, and those were negatively correlated with the dose of GC treatment. Besides, there is a positive correlation between the annual change rate of the maximum diameter of cysts (\u25b3\u00d8max1/t) and the use of CTX; there is a positive correlation between the annual change rate of the total diameter of cysts (\u25b3\u00d8sum1/t) and the use of CTX. Conclusion To the patients of pSS-LIP, female were more common than male, and the onset of LIP was usually more insidious. Hyperglobulinemia and anti-SSA antibody were more prominent in patients with pSS-LIP. Pulmonary function showed the higher rate of obstructive ventilation dysfunction and the lower rate of diffusion dysfunction. The appearance of ground-glass opacities in pSS-LIP patients suggests that the infiltration of inflammatory cells increases, which may cause airway compression, the expansion of terminal bronchioles, and the formation of cysts. The more ground-glass opacities appear earlier, and the more appearance of new cysts later. Therapy with glucocorticoid may be effective on the ground-glass opacity during acute stage, and therapy with cyclophosphamide may be effective on the cysts during chronic stage. The heavier ground-glass opacity is at baseline, the more likely it will recur during maintenance treatment.

Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia(LIP) . Primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS) Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is one of lymphoproliferative disease of lung [1] . Its main manifestation is pulmonary inflammatory response of bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). Pathological tissue biopsy [2] is the gold index for the diagnosis of LIP, which can be used as an important means to distinguish lymphoma and other diseases. The main pathological features of LIP include extensive and polyclonal infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes with widened interlobular/alveolar space [3] [4] [5] . It has been reported [6] that lung lesions in patients with LIP are similar to the infiltration of lymphocytes in lacrimal and salivary glands in patients with pSS. After determining the histopathological diagnosis of LIP, we should actively look for the etiology. Idiopathic LIP is extremely rare. The common related diseases of LIP include autoimmune diseases (pSS, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) [7] [8] [9] , immunodeficiency proteinemia [10] , infection (human immunodeficiency virus and Epstein-Barr virus) [2] , and genetic diseases [10] , among which pSS is the most common [11] . It is reported in the literature that about 25% of the cases of LIP are related to pSS, and it is estimated that 1% of the patients with pSS will develop LIP during the course of illness [3, 12] .

It has been shown that the chronic stimulation of lymphoid tissue by intrinsic and extrinsic antigens may play an important role in the development of the disease. Polyclonal lymphoid infiltration is a disease feature, which has different histopathologic patterns and clinicoradiologic characteristics [17] . Therefore, histological examination is essential. For example, follicular bronchiolitis is characterized by the presence of hyperplastic lymphoid follicles with reactive germinal centers distributed along the wall of bronchioles [18] , and the lumen of bronchioles may be damaged; The main features of HRCT is small centrilobular nodules, with border-like frosted glass, which are confined primarily to the peribronchiolar region, and ground-glass opacities are not common. By comparison with LIP, Its histologic features are characterized by a polymorphous peribronchiolar and alveolar septa infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes, diffusely expanding the alveolar septa. The features of HRCT mainly include ground-glass opacities, intralobular nodule with fuzzy boundaries, and randomly distributed cysts with the thin wall [1] . The cyst is a round parenchymal lucency or lowattenuation area, which usually contains air and exhibits a well-defined interface with normal lung. It is the same characteristic as the CT findings of LIP. Similarly, it needs to be differentiated from other cystic lung diseases. It is very important to analyze the cystic size, location, and characteristics on Fig. 2 Comparison of the changes of cysts between the follow-up 1st and the baseline baseline(*P < 0.05). Comparison of the changes of cysts between the follow-up 2nd and the follow-up 1st (*P < 0.05) Fig. 3 The ground-glass opacities of patients with pSS-LIP. a the lung is clear, that is, having no infiltration; b bilateral diffuse infiltration; c the localized infiltration HRCT [1] . First of all, we need to evaluate whether the lesions on HRCT scan are true cysts (wall thickness < 2 mm), and the following diseases need to be excluded: (1) cavity, most of them are within pulmonary consolidation, a mass, or a nodule, and the wall thickness > 4 mm. (2) Bulla, the diameter of bulla >1 cm (usually several centimeters), the wall thickness < 1 mm, and often accompanied by emphysema in the adjacent lung. (3) Emphysema, subpleural and peribronchovascular regions of low attenuation without wall and being multifocal, which is common in the upper lung zones, and interlobular septa is intact. (4) Cystic bronchiectasis, it is related to bronchial dilation adjacent to the accompanying pulmonary artery (\"signet ring sign\"). Its bronchi do not taper, and bronchi can be seen within 1 cm of the pleura surfaces in HRCT. (5) Honeycombing, there are ring shadows approximately ranging from 3 to 10 mm in diameter, which are usually distributed in subpleural with well-defined walls, with wall thickness of 1-3 mm. The ring shadows have distorted structure with complete loss of acinar structure. Secondly, the number of cysts(solitary, focal, or diffuse) and other radiographic abnormalities (nodules, ground-glass opacities, etc.) needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes lymphangioleiomyomatosis (little cysts with similar size are distributed symmetrically throughout the lung) [1] , Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 syndrome (always associate with cutaneous fibrofolliculomas, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal cancer, multiple cysts were predominantly seen in peripheral lung zones at lung bases and along the mediastinum) [19] , Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (more common in young adult smokers. Nodules are seen in early stages and cysts are seen in later stages. Cysts are seen predominantly in upper and middle lobes, which are variable in size and have bizarre shapes.
