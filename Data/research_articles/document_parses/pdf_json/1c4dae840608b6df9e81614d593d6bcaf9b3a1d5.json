In 1985, Fishman (10) induced infection of the basal ganglia by a coronavirus in mice. Although coronavirus is recognized primarily as a respiratory pathogen in humans, its affinity for the basal ganglia led us to investigate its possible role in human Parkinson's disease. The cerebrospinal fluid of normal controls (CTL) (n = 18), and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD (n = 20) and other neurological disease (OND) (n = 29) was analyzed in a blinded manner by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [measurements in optical density (OD) units] for antibody response to four coronavirus antigens: mouse hepatitis virus JHM (J) and A59 (A), and human coronavirus 229E (E) and OC43 (0). When compared with CTL, PD patients had an elevated (p < 0.05) mean OD response to J (0.0856 VS. 0.0207) and A (0.1722 vs. 0.0636).

There are three distinct antigenic groups into which the 10 species are classified; HCV of the OC43 strain bear antigenic resemblance to the first group (along with MHV, BCV, and HEV), whereas those HCV of the 229E strain share common antigens with the second group (8). Coronaviruses are capable of producing both acute and chronic persistent infections in humans and animals; natural transmission between species is pos-sible leading to clinically inapparent or atypical infections (9). In 1985, Fishman et al. (10) reported a selective affinity of coronavirus MHV-A59 for the basal ganglia in C57 Black mice.
