Similarly to the actual 9 spread of the disease, the dynamics of the contention patterns emerging from the application of 10 NPIs are complex and depend on interactions between people within a specific region as well as 11 other stochastic factors associated to demographic, geographic, political and economical 12 conditions. Agent-based models simulate microscopic rules of simultaneous spatial interactions 13 between multiple agents within a population, in an attempt to reproduce the complex dynamics 14 of the effect of the contention measures. In this way, it is possible to design individual behaviours 15 along with NPI scenarios, measuring how the simulation dynamics is affected and therefore, 16 yielding rapid insights to perform a broad assessment of the potential of composite interventions 17 at different stages of the epidemic. In this paper we describe a model and a tool to experiment 18 with such kind of analysis applied to a conceptual city, considering a number of widely-applied 19 NPIs such as social distancing, case isolation, home quarantine, total lockdown, sentinel testing, 20 mask wearing and a distinctive \"zonal\" enforcement measure, requiring these interventions to be 21 applied gradually to separated enclosed districts (zones). We find that the model is able to 22 capture emerging dynamics associated to these NPIs; besides, the zonal contention strategy 23 yields an improvement on the mitigation impact across all scenarios of combination with 24 individual NPIs.

In this respect, there 38 are two main approaches. The best-known approach uses macroscopic models that represent 39 population level dynamics with causality analysis or through transition between discrete events 40 : medRxiv preprint that affect the state of the system (System Dynamics, Discrete Event Simulation). These sort of 41 models are intended to describe the average infection dynamics and have been used in the past 42 to study the spread of influenza pandemics (Ferguson et al., 2006), and more recently to COVID-43 19 (Ferguson et al., 2020). They are build on the basis of the classical epidemic SIR compartment 44 model (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) or variations of the same, where the entire population is 45 split in such compartments and the dynamic of the epidemics is explained by how disease evolves 46 in each compartment rather than at the individual level. Model parameters such as compartment 47 transition rates are calibrated with available data, whilst others such as reproduction number or 48 NPI settings are assumed in order to simulate hypothetical scenarios, see e.g. Fanelli and Piazza 49 (2020); Wilson et al. (2020); Kantner (2020); Giordano et al. (2020); Ansumali and Prakash (2020); 50 Ferguson et al. (2020); Lai et al. (2020). 51 The other approach resorts to microscopic modelling of interactions simulated at the individual 52 level, also known as microsimulation; here the global phenomena are observed as an emergent 53 property of collective dynamics. Commonly referred as Individual-Based Models or IBM, this ap-54 proach assumes an inherent network structure within the population, yielding contagions depen-55 dent on the interaction (or links) between individuals, whereas onset of symptoms and disease 56 progress are modelled with probability distributions conditioned on age structures. A number 57 of models of this kind have been also proposed recently to study the spread and contention of 58 COVID-19 (Bock et al., 2020; Tuomisto et al., 2020; Gomez et al., 2020). 59 The latter microsimulation approach is also known as Agent-based Modelling or ABM (Railsback 60 and Grimm, 2019). Some advantages of the ABM approach to study the epidemic include their abil-61 ity to model deterministic and non-deterministic decisions made by the individuals affected by 62 interactions with other agents within a spatial vicinity, enabling a more intuitive and closely resem-63 bling the real system being simulated. In this way, uncertainty or variance arises inherently in a 64 ABM, enabling the model to obtain non-deterministic emergencies without input parameter varia-65 tion (Ahmed et al., 2012). The randomness of the spatial patterns followed by the free movement 66 of agents, allows a broader representation of epidemiological relevant heterogeneity in the popu-67 lation. In addition, the ability to define particular individual traits, as well as behaviour and disease 68 progression per individual, are useful features to study how non-deterministic effects emerge from 69 the application of a diverse combination of NPIs. 70 In this paper we propose an ABM model of the COVID-19 epidemic, incorporating a number of 71", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "NPIs such as social distancing, case isolation, home quarantine, total lockdown, sentinel testing, 72 mask protection and a distinctive \"zonal\" restriction where these interventions can be applied to 73 separated districts or zones of a hypothetical city.

They consist of actions recommended to the public or in 84 some cases, enforced by the government, that affect their daily life habits. During the COVID-19 85 pandemic, many of these action plans have been designed and deployed at a global scale. Here 86 we describe those that are currently incorporated into our model. Social Distancing 88 This intervention consists of maintaining a minimum physical distance between people so as to 89 reduce the number of close interactions between infected and healthy individuals, slowing down 90 the speed of transmission and eventual deaths. In the model, this intervention can be set on or 91 off, and the actual amount of people willing to comply with the intervention can be defined with a 92 parameter between 0 and 100%. 93 Case Isolation 94 This intervention consists of confining in an enclosed facility (home) either positive tested people 95 or sufficiently symptomatic patients that self-isolate, until they recover from the disease. In the 96 model, this intervention can be set on or off. 97 Home Quarantine 98 This intervention consists of confinement of relatives or housemates living in the same household 99 of isolated cases, during their recovery. It is assumed that quarantined healthy people in the house-100 hold must observe strict safety protocols to avoid contagion from the isolated case. In the model, 101 this intervention can be set on or off. 102 Total Lockdown 103 This intervention enforces a stay-at-home policy due to partial shutdown of economy. Only some 104 people are authorised to move around to fulfil basic needs or to support essential services. In the 105 model, this intervention can be set on or off with a parameter of percentage of mobility permits 106 between 5 and 95%. 107 Sentinel Testing 108 This intervention consists of running health campaigns performing mass testing at random loca-109 tions in order to detect not isolated or unconfirmed cases of either symptomatic or asymptomatic 110 carriers. Persons whose test result positive are isolated immediately. In the model, this interven-111 tion can be set on or off, with an option to deploy the campaigns widely or restricted to zones. The 112 stock of tests available is a parameter of the model defined as a fraction of the population between 113 10 and 100%. Once the campaigns run out of tests, it is possible to replenished them with a new 114 equal supply. 115 Zonal Enforcement 116 This intervention assumes that the hypothetical city can be divided in different districts (or zones), 117 and then recommends to restrict movement of residents to their respective zones only. In other 118 words, it enforces border closures between districts. The other NPIs can be applied localised to 119 each zone. In addition, the model enables applying a novel NPI consisting of a total lockdown to 120 the entire city with the option of gradually lifting of the curfew by individual zones. In the model, 121 this intervention can be set on or off; besides, it features a command to unlock one zone at a time. 122 Mask Protection 123 This intervention consists of the use of face masks as personal protective equipment to avoid 124 spreading, or breathing in, airborne virus particles. In the model, this intervention is currently 125 simulated as a population habit controlled by a combination of two parameters: carriers (infected 126 people) wearing masks or not, and susceptibles (healthy people) wearing masks or not. A partic-127 ular combination will have incidence in the chance of contagion when two people encounter: 3% 128 if both are wearing masks, 8% if carrier wears masks but susceptible do not, 50% if susceptible 129 wears masks but carrier do not, and 90% if none wear masks. : medRxiv preprint 235 pends on what mask protection intervention is applied, as 236", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "it was explained before.

Since this is one of the distinctive features of our model, we thus decided to assess the 385 effect of combining every individual NPI with the ZE restriction. 386 Interestingly enough, across all scenarios of NPIs combined with ZE, more effective mitigation 387 indicators were obtained. For example, survivor and death count is better than any other sce-388 nario: TL+ZE (survivors: 394\u00b13, death: 6\u00b13), ST+ZE (survivors: 395\u00b15, deaths: 5\u00b15) and MP every-389 one+ZE (survivors: 389\u00b113, deaths: 5\u00b14).

Secondly, 404 since the experiments were designed in a way that only one infected agent (patient zero) is ran-405 domly seeded at the beginning of the simulation, it is likely that in some repetitions, as soon as 406 these NPIs take effect, patient zero can be sent by pure chance to isolation just before he or she 407 can transmit virus to other agents; therefore, in those executions indicators may remain unaltered 408 whilst in other repetitions the epidemics effectively unfolds fully.

Our aim was to focus on finding emergencies in the dynamic of this disease, considering a broad set of traits for the agents;in real life of course, there are many properties of interest that may impact the growing of the epidemics. Here we omitted detailed structures such as age, gender, profession, health status, or family, school and work clusters, transportation, job shifts or economic impacts. Clearly, those properties can be examined as extensions of the model, in the hope of capturing additional hidden patterns that may yield a better assessment of the effects NPIs can have taking additional mechanisms into consideration. Nonetheless, the results obtained indicate that the proposed model can be a useful tool in relation to a rapid assessment of the potential impact of combinations of NPIs at different stages of the contagion.Overall, our findings suggest three relevant recommendations. In general, mass-testing (ST as we denote it in our model) is the one intervention that authorities should give priority to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, providing for this purpose with sufficient stock of tests to medical units performing random testing campaigns.
