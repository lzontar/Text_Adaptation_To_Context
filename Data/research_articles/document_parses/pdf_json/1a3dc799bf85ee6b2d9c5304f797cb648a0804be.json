Based on this framework of the Embedded M&A Strategy a distinguished shortlist of suitable M&A targets with a strong financial, strategic, Business and Culture Design fit have been distilled. The Transaction Management, as the follow-on module of the E2E M&A Process Design, is focused on a specific transaction with a selected target company or merger partner. Core parts of the Transaction Management are the valuation of the target company (Standalone Value) and the potential synergies (Integrated Value), the Due Diligence of the target company which should identify the risks and upsides of the potential transaction, as well as the blending of the Standalone Business and Culture Designs and the Redrafting of the Joint Culture and Business Designs according to the Due Diligence outcomes. Supplementary parts of the Transaction Management as the negotiation of a share or asset purchase agreement, the acquisition financing, and the Purchase Price Allocation (PPA), will be not discussed in detail.

Within the Transaction Management, the indicative valuation of the target company and likely synergies could be defined as the starting point. But this first valuation of the target company and potential synergies determines already the priorities for the forthcoming Due Diligence assessment. The future value add is based on the mission-critical value drivers, the Return on Invested Capital (RoIC), the growth momentum and the sustainability period of the competitive advantage, as these are the lever for the ultimate source of value, the future Free Cash Flows (Koller et al. 2015a, pp. 22-23, 137) . The likelihood of the assumed performance of those value drivers has to be verified during the Due Diligence. Vice versa, the results of the Due Diligence have to be feed-back into the update of the final valuation and the draft of the purchase agreement. Based on a final valuation a preliminary Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) and the upper limit of the purchase price could be defined ( Fig. 3.2) .",

On the one side, a fair value or valuation bandwidth of the standalone value of the target company has to be derived, on the other side the likely synergies on the buyer's and target's side evaluated. The sum of those two values, the so-called Integrated Value, will define the upper financial boundary for the purchase price, and therefore the maximum premium the acquirer could afford to pay without risking value destruction. Within Sect. 3.1 alternative valuation methodologies and a process model for the valuation of the target company as well as for the potential synergies will be described. From a conceptional point of view two valuation approaches, the Income Approach and the Market Approach are the most applied corporate valuation methods for M&As. But, only the Income Approach is a true, intrinsic valuation approach, as it evaluates a company on its forecasted and discounted Free Cash Flows. The transaction or trading multiple concept is, in essence, a pricing methodology, as it evaluates the target company based on prices paid in recent transactions (Transaction Multiples) or on a peer-group of comparable listed companies (Trading Multiples):",

        {
            "text": "-The Income Approach derives the Enterprise Value, as the market value of the (target-) company for all its investors like equity and debt holders, based on the forecasted Free Cash Flows (FCFs) of the company. The most used methodology within the Income Approach is the Enterprise Discounted Cash Flow (Enterprise DCF) 1 1 As an alternative to the Enterprise DCF method the Discounted Economic Profit model will also be briefly discussed. Discounted Economic Profit models have in comparison to the Enterprise DCF model the advantage to highlight the yearly value creation, the Economic Profit, by comparing the RoIC with the Cost of Capital in any specific year. (Koller et al. 2015a, pp. 137-142; Damodaran 2006; Fernandes 2012) . The Enterprise DCF method discounts future FCFs at the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The WACC addresses the time value of money as well as the underlying risk of the target's Business Design. The latter is embedded in the beta factor of the cost of equity by applying the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for the calculation of the equity risk (DePamphilis 2015). As the Enterprise DCF model evaluates the FCFs as available to all investors, like equity holders, debt holders, and any other non-equity investors-e.g. mezzanine investors-and discounts those consistently by using the WACC, it evaluates in the first step the Enterprise Value, meaning the value of the target company for all investors. To define the Equity Value, defined as the market value of equity for the shareholders of the target company, debt and other non-equity claims have to be subtracted from the Enterprise Value. The advantage of the Enterprise DCF model is that it separates operating performance from capital structure impacts and non-operating items. Additionally, it offers the possibility for portfolio companies with multiple strategic business units to use the same valuation framework for the valuation of the company as well as for the valuation of each of its strategic business units (SBUs) due to the value additivity characteristic of the underlying Net Present Value (NPV) concept (Brealey et al. 2020) . This value additivity is typically used in sum of the parts valuations of conglomerates with multiple strategic business units. Discounting future FCFs at the WACC is especially straightforward in situations where the company's financial structure, measured by its debt-to-value ratio, does not or only marginally change. Periodic specific WACCs could also be determined but would imply a yearly recalculation of the Cost of Capital, what might be demanding. Therefore, in situations of more volatile financing structures at the target company, like in restructuring cases or levered Private Equity deals, the Adjusted Present Value (APV) and the Capital Cash Flow (CCF) model (Ruback 2000) might be more suitable models. The APV model is a two-step approach, which is also sometimes referred to as sum-of-the parts assessment. In a first step, the value from the pure operating performance without any financial benefits is calculated by discounting the same FCFs as in the Enterprise DCF model by the unlevered cost of equity instead of the WACC. In a second step, the FCFs of any financial side effects, like tax benefits of leverage (value of the tax shield), or costs of distress are evaluated. The sum of those two components leads to the same Enterprise Value as by applying the Enterprise DCF method if a consistent set of assumptions is used (Koller et al. 2015a, p. 137) The common ground of the Enterprise DCF, the APV and the Capital Cash Flow models is that all of them evaluate in the first step the value of the company for all its investors and then deduct all non-equity claims, like debt and debt-like items, to derive the Equity Value as the market value of equity of the enterprise. Equity valuation methods on the other side evaluate in one step the equity value of the company. This might sound straight forward but mixes up operating performance with non-operating performance and capital structure impacts on FCFs. Therefore, the FCF to equity method is foremost used for and limited to the valuation of companies where the capital structure is an integral part of their Business Design, like in the banking and insurance industry. -The market (pricing) method applies the law-of-one-price: Companies within the same industry and with comparable risk pattern should trade or be sold at similar valuation multiples, meaning having roughly the same relative valuation. Typically applied valuation multiples are Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA, Enterprise Value-to-EBIT or Enterprise-Value-to-revenue ratios. Multiple assessments could also be used to value non-traded companies by comparison with listed companies within their peer group. In case of Trading Multiples, the unknown price of the target company is derived by the median or mean multiple of stock-listed companies within the peer group. In case of Transaction Multiples, recent acquisitions in the same industry are used for the definition of the multiple and the determination of the target's price. The key limitation of this method is, that it only takes the actual market prices of listed companies for the valuation into account and not the pattern and variance of forecasted FCFs. It also neglects the specific strategy and Business Design of the target company in the valuation process by applying a simplistic peer-group assessment. Therefore, the Multiple Approach might be used for the framing of a DCF valuation but not as a standalone approach or even as a substitute for the DCF method. Section 3.1 discusses in-depth the pros and cons of the different valuation and pricing techniques.",

The assessment of the audited financial statements, especially of the balance sheets and the income statements, might provide a first overview of the past performance and an understanding of the likelihood of the forecasted financial performance of the target company. But an advanced FDD has to go beyond a simple headline analysis by identifying and assessing the most important value drivers of the target's Business Design. Besides, the transparency, accuracy and completeness of the financial reporting system have to be assessed. An aligned field of the FDD is the Tax Due Diligence. The Tax Due Diligence does not only address the potential tax liabilities and risks. It might also have a significant impact on the design of the transaction as an asset or share deal. This could lead to complicated and prolonged discussions as the tax impacts of different transaction designs might be inversely related to the interests of the acquirer and the seller. -Legal Due Diligence: Intent of the Legal Due Diligence is the assessment of the most important contracts and to identify the underlying legal risks which have to be addressed either in the purchasing agreement or the Integration Management.",

An investor expects, by acquiring a financial asset, that the value of this financial asset will grow sufficiently to compensate her for the underlying risk of that specific asset, meaning financially above the asset's risk-adjusted opportunity costs of capital. This guiding principle of value creation could be transferred to the corporate world: Companies raise capital on equity and debt markets to finance their investments. They invest this capital in projects which are forecasted to generate future Free Cash Flows (FCFs) at rates of return, more specifically Returns of Invested Capital (RoICs), that exceed their specific cost of capital. The latter is the blended rate of return of investors on equity and debt markets and other forms of funds which they require to be paid for the use of their provided capital (Koller et al. 2015a ). 2",

The target's shareholders are therefore only interested to sell their company if, and only if, they are paid a premium, meaning a transaction price that exceeds this stand-alone value. The seller's shareholders participate, at least partially, in so far on the acquirer's synergy capture. -The buy side perspective: The gross value of the potential transaction to the acquirer starts once more with the target's stand-alone value defined by its discounted FCFs, but takes additionally into account the NPV of the synergies that the acquirer may capture by the specific underlying transaction. This means, that the combined FCFs of the two companies are increased beyond the two standalone values. Synergies are realized therefore if, and only if, the sum of discounted FCFs of the joint company-Integrated Value including synergies-is greater than the sum of the acquirer's and target's standalone discounted FCFs (Clark and Mills 2013, pp. 92-95) . The targeted synergies might be captured on the acquirer's side, the target's side or on both. The allocation of the total synergy value of a transaction on the buy or sell side might depend on the uniqueness of the synergy capture, meaning if the synergies could only be realized by the combination of the specific acquirer's and the target's Business Design or by more or less any acquirer. To identify the shareholder value added on the acquirer's side, from the Integrated Value the purchase price, which includes the acquisition premium, has to be deducted. Therefore, the acquirer's value add of a transaction is, in the end, the difference between the NPV of all synergies and the premium paid. Another interpretation of this equation means, that if the acquirer pays the full value of the net synergies to the seller in the form of a significant takeover premium, then the deal offers no value added on the buy side (Coates 2017, pp. 16-17) . Thus a rational acquirer seeks a price somewhere between the target's standalone value and this stand-alone value plus the NPV of the synergies, meaning the Integrated Value. By sharing the synergies with the seller, the acquirer 3.1 Valuation may pay a premium that induces the seller to conduct the transaction while still enabling both, acquirer's shareholders and seller's shareholders, to realize a value added by the transaction. More or less all empirically M&A studies show thereby, that the distribution of the total value added of a transaction as defined by the sum of synergy based discounted FCFs, tends to be lopsided: The lion's share of a transaction's value added flows typically into the target shareholder's pocket, leaving just a small fraction for the acquirer (Sirower and Sahni 2006, p. 85) .",

The Enterprise Value of a conglomerate is equal to the sum of its parts, meaning the value of its individual strategic business units less the NPV of headquarter costs, plus the value of any non-operating assets.

From a theoretical point, one criticism is, that at least Transaction Multiples include the premiums paid in past transactions and depend therefore on the individual acquirer-target situation. But, the most serious disadvantage is the very simplistic approach to derive the target value by comparing recent market prices with earnings or revenues of peers. This has the serious downside that multiples and the valuations built upon them see-saw like the underlying capital or M&A markets.

Therefore, these two factors should not differ in case of peer group comparisons. The company's specific business performance indicators are its ROIC performance and growth momentum.

Therefore, both strategy levels have to be assessed separately within the SDD. Within the corporate strategy, the priority is to achieve an understanding of the target's portfolio of business activities (SBUs), of the core portfolio strategies, how the target portfolio fits with the acquirer's and if the acquirer offers parenting advantages for synergy leverage on portfolio level. The evaluation of portfolio strategies involves also the discussed Business Model Innovation strategies, like internal business innovation strategies, accelerator and incubator models, M&A activities, or JV and partnering strategies of the target. SBU strategy assessments start with the segmentation of the SBUs products, services, served markets, customers and use-cases. Each SBU has its own specific ecosystem, which describes not only the specific environment of an industry but as well the needs of the customers, underlying technologies and trends. Based on this understanding of the specific ecosystem the SDD can assess the strategic position and competitive strength of the target company in each of its SBUs. This involves the assessment of the regional footprint, the unique selling proposition of its products, and a benchmark with best-in-class competitors with respect to its relative competitive positioning. By combining the assessment of the future attractiveness of the ecosystem and the strategic positioning of the target company within its ecosystem a sound strategy evaluation is possible. Within this step, also the analysis of how the SBUs fulfill the characteristics of Michael Porter's competitive strategies, like cost leadership, differentiation or niche strategies, might be valuable. Besides, the SDD has to assess the SBD concerning its differentiating, unique and lasting core capabilities. These capabilities could be benchmarked with best-in-class competitors.",

The reason might be, that transaction services, as well as Big4 companies with their standardized reports, are frequently involved in FDDs. Nowadays a Financial Due Diligence report frames the following parts: 15 -The first part of an FDD report is the judgement on the quality of the financial statements, the management accounts and the reporting system, the so-called quality of earnings assessment. This includes as well the analysis of the applied accounting principles and a detailed description of the financial reporting processes. The judgement about the quality of financial reports might be based on criteria like functionality, reliability, speed, suitability, robustness and compliance. -In the next section the historical and actual asset values, earnings performance and financial performance are analysed and interpreted. This is one of the core parts of FDD and includes a detailed analysis of the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement as well as of the most important line items. Within the balance sheet assessment, the financing structure of the company will be decomposed in equity, debt and hybrid capital. Besides, debt-like items, like a pension underfunding or potential liability claims, must be identified as they must be subtracted as well in the walk from the Enterprise to the Equity Value. On the assets side, capital expenditures and investments as well as working capital items like accounts receivables, inventory and accounts payables-and in case of project businesses prepayments-might be on the top priority list. Within the income statement analysis, the performance development will be broken down into the detailed assessment of the most important revenue and cost drivers. Also, their impact on cash flows will be analysed, the so-called earnings-to-cash flow conversion. In the final part, tax impacts will be described. -The normalization of earnings for the past years is a separate step. It distinguishes operating performance from one-time effects like periodic specific costs (e.g. restructurings) which have to be stripped out and any non-operating items. This section intends to generate a consistent long-term view on the earnings potential and FCF development of the target company. -In the section on the year-to-date performance, sometimes also called actual performance, deviations from the long-term trend in earnings and FCFs are of interest. This will be framed by an assessment in how far the actual performance deviates from the intended plan performance. The latter is described in most instances by budget targets and might be the underlining benchmark for the management incentive system. In the YTD assessment, the granularity is typically increased from a yearly perspective to a quarterly or even monthly perspective. -In a further part of the FDD, the equity and debt structure will be analyzed. This is as well a very substantial part, as the bridge from the Enterprise to the Equity Value is built by the net-debt position. The sensitive assessment of the net-debt position incorporates not only excess cash and interest-bearing liabilities, like bonds and loans, as net-debt but as well debt-like items, as described. -The conversion rate from earnings (NOPLAT) to FCFs is as well a crucial input for the valuation of the target company as it assesses how much of the realized NOPLAT flows into the cash performance of the company and how much is plowed back (retained earnings) into the target's business. -In most cases the Tax Due Diligence is as well incorporated in the FDD.",

Therefore, priorities have to be set, for example by using thresholds like revenue hurdle rates in customer contracts. The LDD by itself frames multiple subjects. A first part of the LDD is the clarification of shareholder rights and assessment of corporate charters and contracts. This might include important change of control clauses, minority shareholder rights, potential restrictions of dividend policies or liabilities on corporate level. The target of this part is to clarify potential risks on the corporate group level of the target company. A second subject of the LDD, which has to go hand-in-hand with the FDD, is the analysis of the contracts with respect to important assets and liabilities as those might have an immediate impact on the value of the target company.
