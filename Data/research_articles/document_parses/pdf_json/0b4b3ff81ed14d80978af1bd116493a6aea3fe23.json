However, the precise human-to-human transmission routes of the virus remain unclear. 6 As shown in Figure 1 , three major possible transmission routes are known to exist for communicable respiratory infections: the long-range airborne route, the close contact route, and the fomite route. [7] [8] [9] The current dominant view is that MERS-CoV largely spreads via the respiratory close contact route, 10, 11 which is supported by evidence that most of the affected healthcare workers (HCWs) have been nurses who have had prolonged and repeated close contact with MERS-CoV patients. 12 Nevertheless, the possible roles of airborne and fomite transmission cannot be excluded. Research suggests that MERS-CoV may be spread through long-range airborne transmission. For example, the viral RNA has been detected on the entrance to air-ventilating equipment, 13 Healthcare settings have been investigated as breeding grounds for large MERS outbreaks because many cases of infection have not been recognized and isolated in time. 3, 5, 18 Similarly, in the Republic of Korea, almost all cases are suspected to have been hospital acquired, originating from Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital. 19 The index patient for the outbreak in this hospital was a 68-year-old man who had recently travelled to the Middle East and was hospitalized from 15 to May 17, 2015 with no isolation or protection measures implemented. 4 He was thought to have directly infected 26 people, including 11 other patients, 13 visitors or family members, and two HCWs. 4 Compared to previous nosocomial outbreaks on or near the Arabian Peninsula, this outbreak was larger 20 and the distribution of infection showed a clear spatial pattern, although the sample size was not sufficiently large for this pattern to be statistically significant.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 339, "end": 340, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 543, "end": 546, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 547, "end": 550, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 551, "end": 554, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 655, "end": 658, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 659, "end": 661, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 836, "end": 838, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1109, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1279, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1282, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1285, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1437, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1586, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1602, "text": "May 17, 2015", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1658, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1786, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 353, "end": 361, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "To investigate the probable transmission routes of MERS-CoV, we carried out a detailed modeling study of the outbreak in Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital.

For example, all the agents need to open the door to the room to enter the corridor, and family members take care of patients while the cleaners do cleaning work. Appendix S2:Tables S6 and S7show the behavior frequencies and sequences of touching surfaces for the different types of behavior. The multi-agent model retained the heterogeneity for each agent, so agents with the same role share the same rules but do not act synchronously. In addition, agents were endowed with an implicitly bounded intellect to make the simulations more realistic. For example, patients and family members used the public toilets in the corridor only when the toilets in the room were occupied, which influenced the effect of the public surfaces. During the computational period, as shown in Appendix S1:Fig. S1, in each time step for each agent, the agent first acquired information from the global database and then compared the acquired information with the behavior rules and made a command. According to the command, the agent remained static or performed an action. Finally, information about the agents was sent to the global database, which was updated. The global database recorded the agents' state information and the contamination states of the surfaces and air in the temporary workspace. The data processing module was used to process the data from the global database and calculate the infection risk for the three basic transmission routes. The module included six models, namely the F I G U R E 3 Plan of the eighth floor of Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital. The infected patients of the first generation and other inpatients are marked with solid circles of different colors. The source ward in which the index patient stayed is marked in light red.

The prevailing wind direction (westerly) is marked with a yellow arrow multi-zone model, the long-range airborne route exposure model, the normal distribution model, the close contact route exposure model, the surface contamination model, and the dose-response relationship model. Details of the abovementioned mathematical models are provided in Appendix S1.2-S1.7. For the long-range airborne route, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations 31-33 were used to predict the wind pressures for all 48 windows. The multi-zone model 31,34 MIX (multi-zone infiltration and exfiltration) 35 was applied to calculate the hourly airflow patterns and aerosol concentrations in the 36 zones on the outbreak floor.

For the fomite route, the surface contamination model 26 was used to calculate the numbers of viruses on the different environmental and human surfaces. The process by which the viruses spread within the surface network was considered to be a discrete-time nonhomogeneous Markov chain. The transition matrix at a time point F I G U R E 4 System architecture of the multi-agent modeling framework a touching action and was determined by the properties of the two contacting surfaces in the touching action. Because the virus quantities on the mucous membranes of the susceptible agents transferred via hand contact were regarded as the exposure doses due to the fomite route, 8 the surface contamination model was able to directly calculate the exposure doses D f for this route. A dose-response relationship model 25,26,39 was used to compute the infection risk of each agent based on the acquired exposure doses. The parameters used in the models in the data processing module are listed in the tables in Appendix S2. Among these parameters, the largest virus-containing droplet size (d g , \u03bcm), the dose-response parameters in the respiratory tracts (\u03b7 r ,/mRNA copy) and on mucous membranes (\u03b7 m ,/mRNA copy) and the viral load (L 0 , mRNA copies/mL) greatly influenced the infection risk. 8,25 Therefore, we fixed the values of the other parameters and mainly considered the influence of the transmission mode and the four parameters (\u03b7 r , \u03b7 m , d g , L 0 ) on the infection risk. The infection risk I was calculated as follows: where c a equals 1 if the long-range airborne route exists and 0 otherwise, and (c c , c f ) are the indicators for close contact and the fomite route, respectively. The exposure doses D a , D cs , D ci , D cm , and, D f are functions of d g and L 0 . Because the viral load L 0 was assumed to be the same for each virus-laden droplet, the exposure doses were proportional to this variable. To reduce the number of variables, we combined \u03b7 r , \u03b7 m and L 0 as the products \u03b7 r L 0 and \u03b7 m L 0 , which are defined as the dose effects of introducing 1 mL of virus-laden droplets with a viral load of L 0 to the respiratory tract and mucous membranes, respectively.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": ", d g ).

For the predominant wind directions, namely north-westerly, westerly, and south-westerly (Appendix S3:Fig. S4), the wind pressure coefficients on the windows of adjacent wards were mostly positive, whereas those of downstream wards were negative (Appendix S3:Fig. S5), which contributed to larger negative pressures in the downstream wards and smaller negative pressures in the adjacent wards.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": "7 < \u03b7 r L 0 < 10 12 , 10 4 < \u03b7 m L 0 < 10 9 , d g \u2208 \ufffd 20, 50, 100, 200 \ufffd .", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF9": {"text": "\u03b7 r L 0 and \u03b7 m L 0 denote the products of viral load and dose-response parameters in respiratory tracts and on mucous membranes, respectively. prediction of Hypothesis 1 [Long air] fitted the attack rates best because only the prediction of the long-range airborne route presented a higher infection risk in the downstream ward than in the adjacent ward (Figure 5A).
