A number of elements have been proposed as necessary for actions to be considered heroic. 3 Since Urmson's 1958 seminal paper, most accounts consider heroic actions to be supererogatory. 4 5 Supererogatory actions are morally excellent actions that go beyond the duty of the agent: they are actions which are good, but not strictly required. 6 Supporters of the concept of supererogation have used a 'two-tier' model of ethical guidance for action to differentiate what one must do (the obligatory) and what one can only be encouraged to do (the supererogatory). 5 Although all heroic actions are supererogatory, not all supererogatory actions are necessarily heroic. Other elements are generally required to make an action heroic, which help to set heroism apart from other prosocial activities, such as giving money to charity (which are altruistic, not heroic). 3 Heroism typically involves a voluntary engagement with an acknowledged degree of personal risk to help others. 3 The risk does not have to involve physical peril, but may involve 'personal sacrifice in other dimensions of life', such as serious financial consequences or loss of social status. 3 Both having the choice to act in a certain way and recognising the possible risks/costs are important-someone who has been forced into acting, or acts blithely without any awareness of the hazard, does not act heroically.",

In addition to risk of contracting the infection, other costs include 'physical and mental exhaustion, the torment of difficult triage decisions, and the pain of losing patients and colleagues'. 13 The emotional cost of having to live away from vulnerable family members for extended periods of time while working has also been acknowledged. We might thus argue that although some personal risk is inherent in working in healthcare, these risks are so amplified currently that descriptions of heroism are justified. Moreover, the advice for the public to stay at home to protect themselves contrasts sharply with the requirement for healthcare workers to continue attending work to care for patients, which has emphasised the concept of healthcare workers making a significant sacrifice by continuing to work. The widespread use of militaristic language in the coverage of the pandemic has further fostered the image of front-line staff acting heroically in the 'battle' against the virus.",

Yet while these descriptions of 'healthcare heroes' may be superficially fitting, the continuing dominance of the hero narrative in the media is in several ways unhelpful. It is uncontroversial to state that healthcare professionals have a duty of care to their patients. This duty of care is a 'special' positive moral duty, which arises from the relationship between the healthcare worker and the patient. 14 Special duties have two key characteristics: (1) typically they are role related, and are signified by an overt acceptance of the duty, and (2) they can obligate people to incur greater risk in performing the duty than we might expect others to. 14 Yet the duty of care is neither limitless nor fixed. 15 Sokol has been particularly critical of the concept of duty of care, noting that 'in the medical context, is often invoked as a sort of quasi-biblical commandment, akin to \"do not lie\" or \"do not murder\".' 16 While it is intuitively appealing to rely on duty of care to justify what healthcare workers should be expected to do during pandemics, the phrase alone is too nebulous to be useful: relying on it can be 'ethically dangerous by giving the illusion of legitimate moral justification'. 16 If we accept that healthcare workers have a special positive duty to treat patients of emerging infectious disease, even at some personal risk-a 'duty to treat'-we must critically examine both what grounds this duty and what its limits are.",

            "text": "Grounding the duty to treat has proved challenging: 'a solid ethical basis for the health professional's duty to treat victims of\u2026 infectious disease, even at some level of personal risk, has proved elusive'. 17 A number of different accounts have attempted to describe the basis for the duty to treat, the most compelling of which are social contract models. 14 According to these models, healthcare workers have a duty to treat which is grounded in a social contract, the result of a 'negotiation between the medical profession and the community at large'. 17 Healthcare workers have access to certain privileges as a result of their position in society (such as financial renumeration, relative self-regulation, trust and admiration from laypeople) and in return they have a duty to treat which may entail accepting a degree of personal risk. 14 17-19 Clark argues that healthcare professionals who enjoy such benefits, but do not fulfil their duty to treat, are essentially 'free riders'. 18 Narrow social contract models, which focus exclusively on the contract between doctors and society (and thus exclude non-professional but essential health workers), have been criticised for being too limited to adequately address the response required by the healthcare sector as a whole to a pandemic. 12 Reid argues that attempts to ground the duty to treat should address the broader question of what sort of society we want to live in, a question which cannot be viewed as a simple negotiation between any one professional group and a community. 12 In asking, whether we would 'prefer to live in a society that provides healthcare to people with infectious disease\u2026 or in a society that practices a form of quarantining of the ill without treatment, leaving them to die in isolation', Reid recognises a broader social contract which is applicable to all those involved in healthcare, not just doctors. 12 It is clear that the duty to treat is not limitless. Healthcare workers are not duty bound to do absolutely everything in their power to benefit their patients at any level of personal risk: for example, as Sokol points out, few would argue that doctors are morally obligated to donate their kidney to a patient. 16 The idea that the duty to treat is limited, even in the current pandemic, is evidenced by the fact that healthcare workers with medical conditions which make them higher risk for suffering serious COVID-19-related disease have been advised to avoid patientfacing roles. For these healthcare workers, working with patients would thus represent an unacceptable level of personal risk, and would exceed what is required by the duty to treat.",

The need to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to minimise risk of illness among healthcare workers has been highlighted by a number of authors. 9-11 15 20 Other proposed reciprocal duties that healthcare institutions have to their employees include clear communication regarding expectations and risks involved; adequate support, training and resources to perform their duties; counselling and psychological support; support and compensation for their families if they die; and access to treatment or vaccination if it becomes available. 15 17 20 21 The general public, who must play a role in supporting the healthcare system, 'both during an epidemic and in times where there is no crisis', also have reciprocal obligations. 12 Reid notes that the public play a role in supporting a healthcare system when they pay taxes or vote for governments that support the healthcare system. 12 In times of pandemic, the public also fulfil their obligations to healthcare workers by following public health guidance-for example, by adhering to social distancing measures, or by taking actions to minimise the spread of infection such as covering their mouth when coughing.",

Individual heroism does not provide a firm basis on which to build a systematic response to a pandemic: there must be recognition of the responsibilities of healthcare institutions and the general public. In the current pandemic, issues have been repeatedly raised regarding the availability of PPE for healthcare workers. 22 The requirement for employers to provide PPE to minimise the risk to healthcare workers is reflected by the attitudes of workers themselves-97.2% of healthcare workers in one study agreed that their employer was responsible for offering PPE. 23 Media coverage which praises heroism among healthcare workers diverts attention away from the critical importance of ensuring that reciprocal social obligations to healthcare workers are fulfilled; as Reid notes, 'the obligation to noble self-sacrifice seems incompatible with insisting on proper protective equipment.' 12 It has been noted that during the SARS epidemic, the hero narrative proved a politically convenient tool for deflecting attention away from governmental errors: 'by calling health professionals \"heroes\", policy makers in government wanted to escape from their guilt of policy mistakes.' 9 Indeed, a response based on individual supererogatory action neglects the responsibility that the government and healthcare institutions have in supporting workers, and in creating and maintaining the systems required to deliver healthcare. The hero narrative fails to remind the public and healthcare institutions of their own moral duties, as in its focus on individual healthcare workers' selfless sacrifice it does not recognise that their duty to treat is irrevocably tied to reciprocal societal obligations.",

This model of duties and reciprocal obligations is likely to be helpful in guiding our response to the pandemic.
