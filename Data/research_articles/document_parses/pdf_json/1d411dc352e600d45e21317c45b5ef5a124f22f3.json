Results obtained using 16S rRNA sequencing showed that infection with PDCoV strain HNZK-02 significantly altered the composition of chick gut microbiota, with the reduced abundance of Eisenbergiella and Anaerotruncus genera at 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) (P < 0.05), and an increased abundance of Alistipes genus at 17 dpi (P < 0.05). The production of SCFAs in the cecum of PDCoV HNZK-02-infected chicks, including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, decreased in all cases. The expression of inflammatory cytokines (interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin-10) was increased in the cecum tissue and serum of the PDCoV HNZK-02-infected chicks when detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively.
