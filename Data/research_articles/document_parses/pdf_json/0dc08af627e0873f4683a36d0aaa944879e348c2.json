Since 56 then many observations from in vitro and animal experiments have suggested a beneficial role of 57 HCQ and CQ in viral infections (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) ). Yet, the ultimate test for their benefit as antivirals come from 58 human clinical studies and to our knowledge both these drugs are not used as mainstream antiviral 59 agents for any viral infection. This review focusses on the clinical evidence for using both CQ and 60 HCQ as antiviral agents against any viral infection. This reflection and summary of evidence is 61 needed in current context for judicious, evidence-based recommendations for off-label use of these 62 drugs. Even when such evidence may be incomplete or unavailable for emerging infections such as 63 COVID-19, historical attempts for repurposing these agents for other emerging viral infections from 64 time to time, may draw parallels to the current scenario to inform a rational approach to clinical 65 trials and guideline recommendations. 66",

A non-randomized controlled trial from Marseille, France (full-201 paper reviewed) enrolled 26 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 to receive HCQ 202 600mg/d(35). Twenty patients completed HCQ treatment (6 patients also received azithromycin) 203 and all had radiological evidence of pneumonia (CT scan). The control group (n=16) was younger 204 (mean age; 51.2 vs. 37.3 years) and had patients treated at another institution or those treated at 205 the same institution but refused HCQ. More patients in the HCQ group were virologically cured by 206 day 6 (70% vs. 12.5%, p=0.001) including all patients who received azithromycin. 207",

HCQ group 211 received 200mg/d for 3 days followed by 800mg/d for 14-21 days. Only two patients (one in each 212 group) had severe illness. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of 213 aviraemic patients by day 28 (85.4% in HCQ group vs 81.3% in control group, p>0.05). There was also 214 no difference in time to aviraemia, or symptom resolution by day 28. Many secondary outcomes 215 proposed in methods including all-cause mortality, are not reported in results presumably due to 216 lack of events. The second study (ChiCTR2000029559) enrolled and randomized 62 (31 in each 217 group) virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients with evidence of pneumonia on CT scan to receive 218 HCQ (400mg/d for 5 days) or no HCQ treatment. The respiratory distress was not severe 219 (PaO 2 /FIO 2 >300 or SaO 2 /SPO 2 >93%) at enrolment in all recruits. The authors report faster time to 220 clinical recovery (defined as normalization of body temperature and cough relief maintained for 72 hours) and earlier radiological improvement in the HCQ group, but the calculations and radiological 222 reporting standards for these conclusions are unclear.

The same can be said of HCV 245 infection where pan-genotypic directly antiviral agents can now achieve over 90% cure rates with minimum adverse events(42).

Outcomes: Primary outcome was viral load suppression for chronic infections and clearance of 77 viraemia for acute infections. Any other significant outcomes (depending on the type of infection) 78 are discussed narratively as reported by authors given the broad scope of this review. 79 Data sources and search strategy 80 We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry (CENTRAL), 81 Chinese Clinical Trials Registry and MedRxiv (for pre-prints) according to the search strategy detailed 82 in table 1. Bibliographies of eligible articles were also searched. The date of the last search was 30 th 83 April 2020. Two authors searched and selected abstracts independently and all authors identified 84 studies for full-text review by consensus. The following data items were extracted from each 85 included study; study design and location, viral infection and diagnostic criteria, participant 86 demographics, intervention and control groups (if any), drug doses, primary and secondary 87 outcomes and adverse events attributable to therapy. A meta-analysis was planned if comparable 88 clinical trials were available in terms of participants, interventions, comparators and outcomes. Risk 89 of bias for all randomized controlled studies, regardless of whether published or deposited as pre-90 prints, were assessed according to Cochrane guidelines(14). Risk of bias in non-randomized trials 91 with more than one intervention was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool(15). All other study designs 92 were considered to have an inherent high risk of bias. Certainty of evidence was assessed for each 93 infection (only from randomized controlled trials -RCTs) according to the GRADE 94 recommendations(16). Uncontrolled studies and RCTs only available as preprints were not 95 considered for assessing certainty of evidence.",

Two RCTs 119 enrolled adults with a CD4 cell count>200/\u00b5l (17, 18)  and the other enrolled adults with a CD4 cell 120 count >400/\u00b5l (20). HCQ doses used ranged from 400mg/d -800mg/d and comparators included placebo(17, 20)  or zidovudine(18). Two RCTs reported a significant decrease in viral load with no 122 change in absolute CD4 cell count with HCQ (17, 18) while the third RCT(20) recorded a significant 123 increase in viral load and a decrease in the CD4 cell count with HCQ. The two uncontrolled studies 124 were small (n = 20-22) and used HCQ 400mg/d alone (23) or in combination with hydroxyurea plus 125 didanosine (24). There was a modest reduction in viral load after 48 weeks with combination 126 therapy(24) while markers of HIV immune activation was reduced with HCQ in the other study after 127 6 months of treatment(23)suggesting an immunomodulatory role of HCQ. HCQ was well tolerated 128 in all studies. 129 CQ for HIV: Two double blind RCTs enrolled adult patients with HIV (CQ 150-300mg base /d, 8-12 130 weeks)(21, 22) and one open label trial enrolled paediatric patients (CQ 4mg/kg/d for 24 weeks)(19). 131 The smallest trial had 13 patients(22) while the largest had 70 patients(21). The comparators were 132 either placebo(21, 22) or zidovudine plus didanosine (paediatric trial)(19). Both adult trials enrolled 133 patients with a CD4 cell count of at least 250/\u00b5l and demonstrated a modestly beneficial 134 immunomodulatory effect of CQ (a significant decline in activated CD8 cells) (21, 22).
