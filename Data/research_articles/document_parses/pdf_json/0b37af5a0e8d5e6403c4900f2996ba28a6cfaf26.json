For instance, although recently published data show accelerated Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in mechanically ventilated mice, as evidenced by increased levels of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide and cognition-relevant neuroinflammation, there were differential effects of mechanical ventilation on blood-brain barrier permeability between mice with and without pre-existing neurodegenerative pathology [5] . These findings illustrate the potential complexity of the relationship between mechanical ventilation exposure and neurodegenerative processes, which may be modulated by factors related to mechanical ventilation, such as tidal volume and duration of mechanical ventilation, as well as the patient's individual cerebral substrate. Further, the neurocognitive effects of various sedative drugs, which frequently accompany low-tidal volume mechanical ventilation, remain an active area of research [6] .",
