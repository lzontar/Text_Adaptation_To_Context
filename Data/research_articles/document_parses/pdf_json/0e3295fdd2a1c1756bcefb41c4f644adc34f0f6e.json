Under such conditions, T\u03b11 also successfully restores CD8 + and CD4 + T cell numbers in aged patients. Meanwhile, T\u03b11 reduces PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on CD8 + T cells from severe COVID-19 patients in comparison with untreated cases.

However, most COVID-19 cases displayed severe lymphocytopenia, especially in aged and severe cases [2, [5] [6] [7] . Thymosin-\u03b11 (T\u03b11), a kind of polypeptide hormone produced by thymic epithelial cells, can effectively increase T cell numbers, support T cell differentiation, maturation, and reduce cell apoptosis [8] [9] [10] . Therefore, T\u03b11 has been successfully used in clinical practice to treat patients infected with hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), and its efficacy was proved by pathological observation [11] [12] [13] . To enhance immunity, actually, the medical support team members from all over the country got T\u03b11 injection before being deployed to Hubei Province, and no infectious cases were reported till now, suggesting T\u03b11 might have the potential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

A total of 76 severe or critical COVID-19 from two designated hospitals were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study based on the pre-set inclusion criteria. According to the presence or absence of 7 days continuous T\u03b11 injection, the patients under study were categorized as treatment group in 36 patients and nontreatment group in 40 patients. There were no significant differences between the two groups in demographic characteristics and clinical findings at the time of admission, such as age, sex, coexisting disorders, the counts of total lymphocytes, T cells, CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, PCO2 on admission and PCO2 of discharge. Moreover, all of these patients got antiviral and antibacterial treatment during hospitalization. Glucocorticoid and oxygen inhalation are also very common.

For example, IL-6, a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an essential role in regulating immune responses, can rescue lymphocyte from exhaustion following HCV infection [25] . IL-10 is an inhibitory cytokine that has the capacity to induce T cell exhaustion, and blocking IL-10 function has been shown to successfully prevent T cell exhaustion following chronic LCMV infection [26, 27] . The severe/critically ill COVID-19 patients have very high levels of serum IL-6 and IL-10, and these patients also displayed high levels of the PD-1 and Tim-3 on T cells, suggesting that both IL-6 and IL-10 might be mechanistically responsible for mediating exhausted T cell differentiation in COVID-19 patients [7] . Moreover, serum levels of other inflammation factors including PCP, CRP and ferritin on admission were also very high in COVID-19 patients ( Table 1) . However, due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection is extremely emergency in February, we regret having not the capacity to measure serum IL-10, IL-6 and inflammation markers including PCP, CRP and ferritin in T\u03b11-treated patients. Further work is needed to clarify the exact mechanism underlying T\u03b11 down-regulates PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on CD8 + T cells.",

One issue is the normalization of TREC levels among individuals, there are no specific guidelines as to how to normalize circulating TREC copies, and we chose to adjust to total DNA content in the sample. The second issue is we only investigated PD-1 and Tim-3 on CD8 + T cells, further studies using peptides from SARS-CoV-2 virus to activate T cell in vitro and clarify whether T\u03b11 treatment also can enhance IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion from peptides-activated T cells is needed. The third issue is no detective A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 / 19 kits are available to quantify virus titer after T\u03b11 treatment, so we did not know whether T\u03b11 treatment can control virus titers till now. Fourthly, although our results show T\u03b11 treatment has some benefits to COVID-19 patients, it should be interpreted with caution because of inherent nature of retrospective study and small sample size, future longitudinal studies on a larger cohort are eagerly needed. Fifthly, it's very difficult to retrieve clinical improvement related index, which is why we just chose mortality as our primary clinical outcome and is very unlike a recent RCT research [35] , in that study a seven-category ordinal scale was designed prior to the commence of research. Additionally, mortality of this study was crude mortality, which included both COVID-19attributable mortality and mortality related to underlying disease. 4 out of the 36 cases receiving T\u03b11 treatment succumbed, accounting for 11.11%. Some serious complications occurred in these 4 cases during clinical courses of COVID-19, such as hemorrhagic shock resulting from gastrointestinal hemorrhage in case 1, heart attack in case 2, septic shock in both case 3 and case 4.",

For examples, several clinical studies demonstrated T\u03b11 has benefit in the treatment of severe sepsis, which begins with a bacterial or fungal infection [20]. Interestingly, T\u03b11 treatment also significantly increased the number of CD4 + and CD8 + cells in patients with CMV infection accompanied with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after renal transplantation [21]. Similarly, we here extend this field and found that T\u03b11 supplement effectively boosts both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell numbers in COVID-19 cases with severe lymphocytopenia. The naive CD8 + T cells undergo robust proliferation and clonal expansion to differentiate into effector CD8 + T cells that directly kill target cells during acute infection, CD4 + T cells, on the other hand, majorly assist B cells to produce antibodies thus finally clear pathogen. However, some CD8 + T cells are loss of effector functions and become exhausted during chronic infections and cancer where antigen stimulation persists, nevertheless, revitalization of exhausted T cells can reinvigorate immunity. The exhausted T cells express elevated inhibitory receptors like PD-1 or TIM-3 [22]. Interestingly, recent work also confirmed that exhausted T cells are existent in acute viral infections, and T cells from patients in the acute phase of Ebola infection manifested with enhancing PD-1 expression but impaired IFN-\u03b3 production [23]. Moreover, blocking Tim-3 signal efficiently enhanced IFN-\u03b3 secretion from T cells following H1N1 infection model [24]. Our previous work has firstly reported that SARS-CoV-2 triggers the expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 on T cells, suggesting exhausted T cells were persistent in COVID-19 patients during SARS-CoV-2 acute",
