One strategy is to eliminate, to the extent possible, exposure to animal-and humanderived raw materials. This is not always feasible, and often cannot be implemented in regards to legacy products, without risk of altering in unknown ways a product of established safety and efficacy. Foremost among the possible strategies is controlling what materials to which the product is exposed by appropriate donor screening and geographic sourcing, as well as traceability and documentation, and in the case of BSE risk, eliminating high-risk specified risk materials from the collection process at the abattoir.

This ability was exploited to develop an early clinical diagnostic test for viruses. These tests, either the hemagglutination of RBCs by supernatants, sera, or plasma containing viruses or the ability of infected cells in culture to hemadsorb RBCs (Shelokov et al. 1958) , permit a visualization of viruses by cross-linking viruses and RBCs together in a large enough clump to be observed by the naked eye (hemagglutination) or by light microscopy (hemadsorption).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 662, "end": 684, "text": "(Shelokov et al. 1958)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hemagglutination and Hemadsorption"}, {"text": "However, not all viruses contain a protein that can hemagglutinate RBCs.

In the absence of RT enzyme, the RNA template will not be reverse transcribed to DNA and thus, no PCR amplification will occur. But, in its presence, amplicons are generated. This enhances the sensitivity of the method to detect RT by about six orders of magnitude over the conventional method.

SPF does not mean being free of all pathogens nor of nonpathogenic (in that species) viruses, but only means being free of specific pathogens, as the term implies. Also, the degree of \"SPF-ness\" can vary, in that one can have differing numbers of pathogens from which a herd, flock, or colony of animals must be free. So, for different purposes, one may have a list of, e.g., 10 pathogens, 15 pathogens, or 25 pathogens, for which a herd, flock, or colony is monitored. All of these would be considered SPF, but some would be \"more SPF\" than others.

In FDA regulations that were revoked in 1997 as being obsolete, restrictive, duplicative, or unnecessary, 1 the test methods were described in the context of testing of viral harvests of specific vaccines and so dose equivalents were given in terms of viral titers that would reflect a final container dose for that vaccine. The origins of the specific guidelines are very likely rooted in what was considered practical at the time the regulations were first promulgated. Cornfield et al. (1956) described the application of 500 dose equivalents for detecting residual infectious poliovirus after inactivation in order to provide a 1/100,000 chance (after multiple tests at different process stages) that any given dose might contain an infectious unit of poliovirus. Likewise, 500 dose equivalents (or minimum volume of 50 mL, whichever was greater) was promulgated in the 21 CFR-mandated testing for measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines in the 1960s, although the concept was entirely different since these were live vaccines, and the tests were for adventitious agents rather than residual live vaccine virus following inactivation. The similar figure of 500 dose equivalents was not statistically derived, nor is there literature describing the probability of detection of an adventitious agent in a dose of vaccine, as Cornfield et al. did for inactivation of poliovirus. Similar to the revoked U.S. regulations, the European Pharmacopoeia (EP) section 2.6.16 (EP 2014a) specifies testing the greater of 50 mL or 500 dose equivalents for both virus seeds and harvests. However, for testing cells, cell lysates, spent culture fluids, or viral seeds (in the case of the U.S., although this is addressed in the EP as stated above), there was no clear guidance. The FDA guidance document that was finalized and published in 2010, \"Guidance for Industry Characterization and Qualification of Cell Substrates and Other Biological Materials Used in the Production of Viral Vaccines for Infectious Disease Indications,\" made an effort to add clarity on the recommended amounts to test for these samples (FDA/CBER/OVRR 2010).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 948, "end": 971, "text": "Cornfield et al.

Similarly, testing 100 dose equivalents in eggs is not the same sensitivity as 500 dose equivalents in cell cultures. Testing 10 7 cell equivalents as part of cell substrate characterization in animal and cell culture systems is unlikely to represent the same sensitivity as testing the maximum nucleic acid load per well in a PCR assay for a specific virus (typically *0.5 ug, representing roughly 10 5 cell equivalents).

However, direct testing with novel readouts could increase the understanding of the landscape of potential agents to be considered as potential safety risks, and for which suitable assays for biological function might be needed. Few reports exist in the scientific literature of systematic surveys of animal-derived raw materials by the novel readouts for potential agents of concern, though it is likely that companies and technology developers are privately pursuing this objective. Additionally, anything less than 100 % sampling and testing of a raw material is inevitably insufficient to assert that the material is absolutely free of detectable contaminants. Current testing paradigms rely on verification tests of animal-derived components coupled with validated processing of those components to reduce risk.

Viral clearance validation or validation of inactivation procedures for inactivated vaccines are intended to establish such viral safety margins. We find this concept useful in thinking about the needed sensitivity of viral detection methods to ensure freedom from adventitious agents and consider whether conventional or novel methods can attain such, as discussed below. Models can help build some of the necessary quantitative context, and would take into account the load from materials and even previous steps, ability to replicate in the manufacturing system, ability to be cleared or inactivated, and proportion of the culture used to make a final dose. Output of a model could include doses of vaccine per infectious unit of the potential virus with specified growth characteristics. An intermediate value in the calculation, infectious units/mL of culture, could be compared with the known sensitivities of the conventional detection method as well as the novel method, allowing some visibility into whether the limits of detection or breadth of detection of either analytical method really provides a meaningful viral safety limit compared with that contributed by the manufacturing process and controls. The challenges with such a modeling approach become obvious-many values are required for which solid experimental data may not be available. Clearly, recalibration would be necessary, requiring another assumption, to convert from infectious units to viral genome copy equivalents to enable these comparisons.

The more tests that are run, the more likely that a false positive result will be observed, if each test is validated to a confidence level of 95 % (i.e., then statistically 5 % of tests could be falsely positive by chance). And finally, and importantly, discordant results on tests that measure the same parameter (i.e., detection of viral contaminants) could become a QA/QC quagmire. Manufacturers would need to prospectively determine an algorithm not only for validity criteria within a single test, but also for which test to \"believe\" or what testing strategy would need to be undertaken to resolve the matter in the case of discordant results between tests for the same measure.

Both EP 2.6.16 and FDA specify a 100-dose equivalent requirement for testing.

Both FDA and EP2.6.16 specify an initial 2-week observation of suckling mice, but only FDA specifies a blind passage of tissues from surviving mice into another set of suckling mice for an additional 2 weeks (WHO recognizes the FDA option in small print).

FDA allows for the test for M. tuberculosis to be replaced by validated in vitro culture and PCR methods (WHO allows shortened culture with PCR endpoint). It is unclear if the 42-day test would still be required exclusively to detect LCMV if another test is performed for M. tuberculosis.
