Although the PHEIC announcements can be categorized as the same type of event, we found no consistent patterns in market reactions. The markets did not show significant reactions in a 30-day event window, which suggests a relatively low economic impact of the diseases on a global scale during this time, except for Covid-19.

What was perceived to be comparable to a regular flu, turned out to trigger the worst crisis since World War II (\"Coronavirus: Greatest test,\" 2020). Since 2005, serious pandemics with the potential requirement of an internationally coordinated response can be formally declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (\"Strengthening health security,\" 2005). Since then the WHO has announced six PHEIC: H1N1 (swine influenza) in 2009, poliovirus and Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, Zika virus in 2016, Ebola outbreak in 2019, and Covid-19 in 2020.

Donadelli, Kizys and Riedel (2017) documented that investor mood, driven by WHO alerts and disease-related news, leads to a significant positive effect on pharmaceutical companies' stock returns in the United States. Using historical data back to 14 th century, Jord\u00e0, Singh and Taylor (2020) demonstrate that significant macroeconomic effects of the pandemics persist for about forty years. We also acknowledge the study of Abdullah et al. (2020) that the number of cases and deaths could be predictive factors of stock returns during the COVID-19 outbreaks. Ramelli and Wagner (2020a) state that investors reacted to the outbreak and spread of Covid-19 in different phases and emphasize the concerns of investors about corporate debt and liquidity. In contrast, our study focuses on short-term stock market reactions to different PHEIC announcements on a global scope. To our best knowledge, our research is the first one that compares all six PHEIC announcements at a cross-country level using event study methodology. Hence, this paper attempts to answer two main research questions: (i) How do different equity markets react to the variety of PHEIC announcements made by the World Health Organization? (ii) How long do the over-or under-reactions persist in the particular event windows? In doing so, we analyzed 26 stock market indices over a period of 12 years during six public health crises by using event study methodology (MacKinlay, 1997) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 76, "end": 110, "text": "Donadelli, Kizys and Riedel (2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 338, "end": 368, "text": "Jord\u00e0, Singh and Taylor (2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 501, "end": 523, "text": "Abdullah et al.

The significant negative returns in the [0, 2] event window indicate an additional late reaction of the market to the announcement. Additionally, an increasing number of infected people as well as further lockdown measures could be explanations for the strong negative cumulative abnormal returns in the event windows. The [0, 13] event window did not reveal any significant cumulative abnormal returns for the country indices which indicates no significant reaction of the markets in the medium-term.

This emphasizes the severity of the disease and its impact on the global economy. Furthermore, it shows that investors were too slow in adjusting to the severe impacts of Covid-19 which indicates an underreaction on the announcement day.

To what extent the perception of severity is in line with reality, and to what extent the stock market reactions are justified by economic fundamentals, are still open questions.

Our analysis provides a starting point of documenting differentiated market reactions at a cross-event and cross-country level.
