In eight patients, lesions began with a burning pain, which shifted towards pruritus in five patients. Lesions started 26.5 days prior to consultation (14-52) and healed within 35 days (27-45) without sequelae in 7 patients. Five patients experienced short-duration viral symptoms without fever, anosmia nor ageusia. None of them had contact with a confirmed COVID infected person. Biopsies showed (Figure) inconstant epidermal lesions (apoptotic keratinocytes, epidermal necrosis, basal layer vacuolation, mild spongiosis and parakeratosis), an upper dermis edema, and a perivascular and periadnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. Vascular lesions were prominent with angiocentrism, angiotropism and endothelium swelling, capillar ectasy and fibrinoid thrombi.
