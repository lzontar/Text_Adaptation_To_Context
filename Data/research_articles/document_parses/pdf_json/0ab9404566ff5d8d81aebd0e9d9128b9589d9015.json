In this regard, mathematical modeling is an interesting approach that can allow the evaluation of different scenarios, furnishing information for a proper support for health system decisions. In general, nonlinear dynamics of biological and biomedical systems is the objective of several researches that can be based on mathematical modeling or time series analysis (Savi, 2005) . In particular, coronavirus propagation can be described by a mathematical model that allows the nonlinear dynamics analysis, representing different populations related to the phenomenon. Literature presents some examples related to the dynamics of infectious diseases. Different kinds of models can be employed, essentially considering nonlinear governing equations. Rihan et al. (2018) described the dynamics of coronavirus infection in human, establishing interaction among human cells and the virus. Chen et al. (2020) developed a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus considering a simplified version of the bats-hosts-reservoir-people transmission model, defined as a reservoir-people model. Results follow the general trend of the initial propagation. Li et al. (2020) estimated characteristics of the epidemiologic time distribution, exploiting some pattern trends of transmission propagation. Riou & Althaus (2020) exploited the pattern of human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. Two key parameters are considered: basic reproduction number that defines the infectious propagation; and the individual variation in the number of secondary cases. Uncertainty quantification tools were employed to define the transmission patterns. Susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) models are an interesting approach to deal with the mathematical modeling of coronavirus transmission. Wu et al. (2020) investigated Wuhan -China case, evaluating nowcasting and forecasting domestic and international spread outbreak. Lin et al.
