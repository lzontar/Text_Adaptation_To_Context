H-type patients have pneumonia-like thickening of the lungs and require ventilation to survive; L-type patients have clearer lungs that may be injured by mechanical assistance 2,3 . As treatment protocols differ between the two types, and the number of ventilators is limited, it is vital to classify patients appropriately. To date, the only way to confirm phenotypes is through high-resolution computed tomography 2 . Here, we identify L-and H-type patients from their frontal chest x-rays using feature-embedded machine learning. We then apply the categorization to multiple images from the same patient, extending it to detect and monitor disease progression and recovery. The results give an immediate criterion for coronavirus triage and provide a methodology for respiratory diseases beyond COVID-19.",

Resolution of CT images improves with the number of different views; higher resolution removes artifacts and provides cross-sections that allow visual separation of internal organs (Figs. 1a-c) . The significance of this can be seen by comparing CT scans with individual x-ray images (Figs. 1e-h): each x-ray picture is a 2D projection of the 3D body image, so that all internal features are superimposed. This overlap complicates diagnosis considerably, especially when disease forms around the heart and behind the breastbone. Nevertheless, frontal x-rays are the most frequent radiological test performed in intensive care units 8 and are used often at the initial point of care to diagnose respiratory distress, e.g. pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 9 .",

Compared with a normal image, a pneumonia x-ray shows a diffuse pattern characteristic of fluid-filled lungs. Known as ground-glass opacities when translucent and consolidation when fully opaque, these regions form when an overstimulated immune system fills the alveoli with cells and fluid 13, 14 . Consequently, the location and density of these regions give many indications of the type and stage of disease. Similar patterns are seen in COVID-19 patients 15 , particularly as the illness progresses (Figs. 1b,d,f). Figure 2 shows the results of three different numerical approaches for embedding features from the xray images. Each reduces the high-dimensional image space to a 2D plot of the samples. All are unsupervised, in the sense that data labels are known but only provided afterward for visualization; they are not seen or used by the algorithms. Figure 2a shows the output from Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is a linear technique that rearranges the input data to maximize variance. It preserves large distances between points, so that samples that are distinct from each other end up far apart. It gives three clusters of x-rays with significant overlap among the points. Projection along the main principal component (Fig. 2b) gives a Gaussian profile for COVID-19 patients, a direct result of the broad statistics of the underlying data.",

Likewise, it would help to leverage an additional viewpoint, such as the lateral (side) x-ray images commonly taken at the same time as the frontal view. Lateral x-rays are particularly useful for assessing the air spaces behind the breastbone and heart 13 and provide an extreme form of limited-angle tomography 29 , giving much-needed perspective for volume estimation. Finally, it is important to correlate the x-ray images with data from other observations as well 30 , such as cardiovascular 24 and renal 31 metrics, the improvement of many patients via prone positioning (laying on the stomach) 32 , and acoustic signatures of wheezing, gasping, and coughing 33 .",
