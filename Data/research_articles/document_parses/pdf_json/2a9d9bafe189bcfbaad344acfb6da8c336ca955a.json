A recent analysis of in Italy identified links between air pollution and death rates. Here, we explored the correlation between three major air pollutants linked to fossil fuels and SARS-CoV-2 lethality in England. We compare up-to-date, real-time SARS-CoV-2 cases and death measurements from public databases to air pollution data monitored across over 120 sites in different regions. We found that the levels of some markers of poor air quality, nitrogen oxides and ozone, are associated with COVID-19 lethality in different English regions. We conclude that the levels of some air pollutants are linked to COVID-19 cases and morbidity.",

Previous studies showed that exposure to nitrogen dioxide is associated with a significant decrease in pulmonary function and promotes an inflammatory response in the airway 14 15 16 . In fact, a recent study showed that intensive care unit (ICU) ventilation duration associates with preadmission exposure to nitrogen dioxide 17 . Furthermore, Faustini and colleagues 18 reported that a 10 \u00b5g/m3 increase in the annual concentration of nitrogen dioxide is associated with a 13% and 2% increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, respectively.

Ozone is a secondary by-product of traffic-related air pollution and is generated through sunlight-driven reactions between motor-vehicle emissions and volatile organic compounds 21 . Generally, high ozone levels have been associated with reduced lung function and increased incidence of respiratory symptoms 22 . We found the lowest levels of ozone to be in highly urbanised regions, such London or the Midlands. Given the highly reactive nature of ozone, decreased levels in these regions may indicate increased conversion of ozone to secondary gaseous species, a phenomenon previously reported for areas with increased traffic 23 . For instance, ozone can readily react with other gaseous species and particulates in the environment, resulting in the formation of respiratory irritants, such as terpene derivatives 24 . Therefore, the detrimental effects of low ozone concentration observed in this study could be linked to increased generation of ozone oxidation products. Further research is necessary to determine the exact identity of these pollutants and their effect on COVID-19 severity and progression.",

Air pollution data between 2018 and 2019 was obtained from the European Environmental Agency (EEA). This agency offers one of the largest online repositories of up-to-date, quality-controlled environmental information in Europe. For the present study, we collected annual aggregated air quality values (AQ values) determined by the EEA based on primary observations obtained from over 120 monitoring stations across England. Stations located near airports (i.e. Luton) or near/within National Reserves were excluded from the analysis as measured observations are sparse and inconsistent. Because of limited data availability, we also restricted our analysis to individual pollution indices for three major air pollutants, namely nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxide and ozone across the pre-specified regions. Nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxide and ozone AQ values are expressed in \u00b5g/m3 and represent the annual average of daily measurements for each air polluting substance across the year 2018 to 2019 in each specified region. The ID of each monitoring station was matched to each available city by accessing the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) website.
