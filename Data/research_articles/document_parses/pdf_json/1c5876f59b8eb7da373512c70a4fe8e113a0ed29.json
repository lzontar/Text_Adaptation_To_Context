However, viruses often evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies (antigenic drift). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral HLA peptides presented on virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. Here we propose a personalized workflow to identify an optimal set of T-cell epitopes based on the HLA alleles and the immunopeptidome of an individual person. Specifically, our workflow trains a machine learning model on the immunopeptidome and then predicts HLA peptides from conserved regions of a virus that are most likely to trigger responses from the person's T cells. We applied the workflow to identify T-cell epitopes for the SARS-COV-2 virus, which has caused the recent COVID-19 pandemic in more than 100 countries across the globe.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Since Louis Pasteur experimented with live attenuated cholera vaccine and inactivated anthrax vaccine at the end of the 19th century, these methods of producing vaccines have saved billions of lives and are still in use today. Such vaccines are designed to stimulate the host immune system to elicit specific antibodies that bind to the corresponding antigens on the surface of a virus and neutralize the virus. In addition, memory B cells are formed to provide long-term protection by remembering the antigens and quickly producing the antibodies in future reexposure to the same virus. However, both antibodies and memory B cells are specific to the antigens, and the later are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the former (so called \"antigenic drift\"). Once a mutated virus escapes the antibodies and infects the host cells, it now depends on the T-cell mediated immunity to fight against the virus. Inside the infected cells, viral proteins are processed into short peptides, which are then loaded onto MHC proteins (MHC: major histocompatibility complexes). Subsequently, the MHC-peptide complexes are presented on the surface of infected cells for recognition by specific T cells. Activated CD8 + T cells then recognize and clear the infected cells. Similar to the antigen-antibody association, the T-cell immunity also depends strictly on the MHC-peptide complexes. MHC proteins are encoded by human leukocyte antigen (HLA), a gene complex that is located among the most genetically variable regions on the human genome. HLA alleles essentially change from one individual to another, and each allele can only present a certain set of peptides. HLA peptides that can be presented on the surface of infected cells and recognized by T cells are called T-cell epitopes. Last but not least, for a vaccine to provide long-term and robust protection, it is essential to identify T-cell epitopes that originate from conserved regions of the virus. Given the extremely high specificity of the MHC-peptide-T cells mechanism, a personalized approach is desirable to precisely identify optimal conserved T-cell epitopes for each individual person.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "As of March 11, 2020, COVID-19 has been spreading to over 100 countries on all continents.

While the epidemic initially started in China with majority of infected cases (~70%), massive clusters of thousands of cases have broken out in several other countries, including Italy, Iran, South Korea, France, Spain, Germany, and the United States.

While having less fatality rate, the number of infected cases of COVID-19 in just three months has exceeded 10 times the total number of SARS and MERS, two other viruses from the corona family that have caused recent outbreaks in 2003 and 2012. This very high level of contagious may suggest that COVID-19 is able to mutate quickly for adaptation, probably even more than influenza. Thus, vaccines based on antibodies and memory B cells may become obsolete soon after introduced. For instance, in the case of influenza, we have to inoculate people with an updated vaccine every year, which is often only partially effective [1] .

Following [16] , we used NetCTLpan 1.1 server to find potent target peptides from the S protein of nCoV-2019 (GenBank: MN908947.3). The NetCTLpan tool integrates peptide MHC binding prediction, proteasomal C terminal cleavage and TAP transport efficiency. A combined rank score is given for each pair of peptide and HLA allele. This score represents the rank of prediction score to a set of 1,000,000 random natural 9mer peptides. We filtered NetCTLpan-predicted peptides with a rank score threshold of 2%. After filtering, 177 peptides remained, and on average, each allele had 23 candidate peptides. Alignment of those peptides against the Uniprot human database showed that none of them was self-peptide. Next, we applied the IEDB immunogenicity prediction tool to predict the immunogenicity of those 177 peptides. The median of immunogenicity scores was used as a threshold to select the top 50% peptides. Table 1 shows the top 3 candidates and their corresponding predicted immunogenicity score for each included allele. The candidate peptides were ranked by the MHC score predicted by NetCTLpan.
