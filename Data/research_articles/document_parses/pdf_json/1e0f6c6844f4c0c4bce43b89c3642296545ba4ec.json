In many trials, a 1.9 to 5.1-fold reduction in the incidence of these diseases was observed in vaccinees. Furthermore, interferon was measurable in the blood, nasal washings and urine of vaccinees, the maximum titres being observed on the 5th to 8th days.

Interferon in the nasal washings was to some degree related to the expression of symptoms. It does not appear that vaccination with live enteroviruses will provide a satisfactory method for the prevention of acute respiratory disease due to viruses.",
