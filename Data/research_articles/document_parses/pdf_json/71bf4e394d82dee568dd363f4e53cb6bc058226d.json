This is likely a result of our sample encompassing a large cohort of patients who were asymptomatic and were only identified as being COVID-19 positive due to the mass screening efforts of the Kuwaiti government for incoming travelers.

A contributing factor to the lower proportion of women in our study sample, may be the high rates of COVID-19 detected in manual laborer of Indian ethnicity, who tend to be both male and younger. An outbreak in two main epicenters, Al-Jileeb and Mahboula areas in Kuwait, both of which house high concentrations of Indian male manual laborers may also account for the large proportion of young, male, Indian patients in our study sample (48\u00b71%) 7 .
