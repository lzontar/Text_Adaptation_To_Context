Approximately 60-80% of CNS drugs are metabolized via enzymes of the CYP gene superfamily; 18% of neuroleptics are major substrates of CYP1A2 enzymes, 40% of CYP2D6, and 23% of CYP3A4; 24% of antidepressants are major substrates of CYP1A2 enzymes, 5% of CYP2B6, 38% of CYP2C19, 85% of CYP2D6, and 38% of CYP3A4; 7% of benzodiazepines are major substrates of CYP2C19 enzymes, 20% of CYP2D6, and 95% of CYP3A4.

Approximately, 127 million Europeans suffer brain disorders. The total annual cost of brain disorders in Europe is about \u20ac386 billion, with \u20ac135 billion of direct medical expenditures (\u20ac78 billion, inpatients; \u20ac45 billion, outpatients; \u20ac13 billion, pharmacological treatment), \u20ac179 billion of indirect costs (lost workdays, productivity loss, permanent disability), and \u20ac72 billion of direct non-medical costs. Mental disorders represent \u20ac240 billion (62% of the total cost, excluding dementia), followed by neurological diseases (\u20ac84 billion, 22%). 1 Senile dementia is becoming a major problem of health in developed countries, and the primary cause of disability in the elderly. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent form of dementia (50-70%), followed by vascular dementia (30-40%) , and mixed dementia (15-20%) . These prevalent forms of agerelated neurodegeneration affect more than 25 million people at present, and probably more than 75 million people will be at risk in the next 20-25 years worldwide. The prevalence of dementia increases exponentially from approximately 1% at 60-65 years of age to more than 30-35% in people older than 80 years. It is very likely that in those patients older than 75-80 years of age most cases of dementia are mixed in nature (degenerative + vascular), whereas pure AD cases are very rare after 80 years of age. The average annual cost per person with dementia ranges from \u20ac10,000 to 40,000, depending upon disease stage and country, with a lifetime cost per patient of more than \u20ac150,000. In some countries, approximately 80% of the global costs of dementia (direct + indirect costs) are assumed by the patients and/or their families. About 10-20% of the costs in dementia are attributed to pharmacological treatment, including anti-dementia drugs, psychotropics (antidepressants, neuroleptics, anxiolytics), and other drugs currently prescribed in the elderly (antiparkinsonians, anticonvulsants, vasoactive compounds, antiinfl ammatory drugs, etc). In addition, during the past 20 years more than 300 drugs have been partially or totally developed for AD, with the subsequent costs for the pharmaceutical industry, and only 5 drugs with moderate-to-poor effi cacy and questionable cost-effectiveness have been approved in developed countries. [2] [3] [4] The lack of accurate diagnostic markers for early prediction and an effective therapy of CNS disorders are the two most important problems to effi ciently diagnose and halt disease progression. The pharmacological treatment of CNS disorders, in general, accounts for 10-20% of direct costs, and less than 30-40% of the patients are moderate responders to conventional drugs, some of which may cause important adverse drugs reactions (ADRs). In the case of dementia, less than 20% of the patients can benefi t from current drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine), with doubtful cost-effectiveness. The pathogenic mechanisms of most CNS disorders (e.g., psychosis, depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, etc) are poorly understood. This circumstance makes it diffi cult the implantation of a molecular intervention to neutralize causative factors. In fact, more than 80% of the 25,000 genes integrating the human genome are expressed in the CNS at different periods of the life span, and only a few neurotransmitters (e.g., noradrenaline, dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA, histamine, and less than ten neuropeptides) are the actual targets of conventional psychopharmacology. Common features in CNS disorders include the following: (a) polygenic/ complex disorders in which genomic and environmental factors are involved; (b) deterioration of higher activities of the CNS; (c) multifactorial dysfunctions in several brain circuits; and (d) accumulation of toxic proteins in the nervous tissue in cases of neurodegeneration. For instance, the neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (amyloid deposition in senile plaques, neurofi brillary tangle formation, and neuronal loss) is but the phenotypic expression of a pathogenic process in which more than 200 genes and their products are potentially involved.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 165, "text": "(25-30%)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 177, "end": 185, "text": "(20-25%)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 738, "end": 739, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 973, "end": 981, "text": "(30-40%)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1003, "end": 1011, "text": "(15-20%)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2487, "end": 2490, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2491, "end": 2494, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2495, "end": 2498, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Drug metabolism, and the mechanisms underlying drug effi cacy and safety, are also genetically regulated complex traits in which hundreds of genes cooperatively participate.

Several candidate genes for schizophrenia may also be associated with bipolar disorder, including G72, DISC1, NRG1, RGS4, NCAM1, DAO, GRM3, GRM4, GRIN2B, MLC1, SYNGR1, and SLC12A6. Genes associated with bipolar disorder include TRPM2 (21q22.3), GPR50 (Xq28), Citron (12q24), CHP1.5 (18p11.2), GCHI (14q22-24), MLC1 (22q13), GABRA5 (15q11-q13), BCR (22q11), CUX2, FLJ32356 (12q23-q24), and NAPG (18p11). 9 Another paradigmatic example of heterogeneity and complexity is dementia, one of the most heterogeneous disorders of the CNS. The genetic defects identifi ed in AD during the past 25 years can be classifi ed into three main categories: (a) Mendelian or mutational defects in genes directly linked to AD, including (i) 32 mutations in the amyloid beta (A\u03b2)(ABP) precursor protein (APP) gene (21q21); (ii) 165 mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene (14q24.3); and (iii) 12 mutations in the presenilin 2 (PS2) gene (1q31-q42) 8, 10, 13 (Table 40 .1). (b) Multiple polymorphic variants of risk characterized in more than 200 different genes distributed across the human genome can increase neuronal vulnerability to premature death 8 (Table 40 .1). Among these genes of susceptibility, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene (19q13.2) is the most prevalent as a risk factor for AD, especially in those subjects harbouring the APOE-4 allele, whereas carriers of the APOE-2 allele might be protected against dementia. 8 APOE-related pathogenic mechanisms are also associated with brain aging and with the neuropathological hallmarks of AD. 8 (c) Diverse mutations located in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) through heteroplasmic transmission can infl uence aging and oxidative stress conditions, conferring phenotypic heterogeneity. 8, 14, 15 It is also likely that defective functions of genes associated with longevity may infl uence premature neuronal survival, since neurons are potential pacemakers defi ning life span in mammals. 8 All these genetic factors may interact in still unknown genetic networks leading to a cascade of pathogenic events characterized by abnormal protein processing and misfolding with subsequent accumulation of abnormal proteins (conformational changes), ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction, excitotoxic reactions, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial injury, synaptic failure, altered metal homeostasis, dysfunction of axonal and dendritic transport, and chaperone misoperation 8,16-20 ( Fig. 40.1 ). These pathogenic events may exert an additive effect, converging in fi nal pathways leading to premature neuronal death. Some of these mechanisms are common to several neurodegenerative disorders which differ depending upon the gene(s) affected and the involvement of specifi c genetic networks, together with cerebrovascular factors, epigenetic factors (DNA methylation) and environmental conditions (nutrition, toxicity, social factors, etc). 8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] The higher the number of genes involved in AD pathogenesis, the earlier the onset of the disease, the faster its clinical course, and the poorer its therapeutic outcome. 8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] High throughput microarray gene expression profi ling is an effective approach for the identifi cation of candidate genes and associated molecular pathways implicated in a wide variety of biological processes or disease states. The cellular complexity of the CNS (with 10 3 different cell types) and synapses (with each of the 10 11 neurons in the brain having around 10 3 -10 4 synapses with a complex multiprotein structure integrated by 10 3 different proteins) requires a very powerful technology for gene expression profi ling, which is still in the very early stages and is not devoid of technical obstacles and limitations. 23 Transcripts of 16,896 genes have been measured in different CNS regions. Each region possess its own unique transcriptome fi ngerprint that is independent of age, gender and energy intake. Less than 10% of genes are affected by age, diet or gender, with most of these changes occurring between middle and old age. Gender and energy restriction have robust infl uences on the hippocampal transcriptome of middle-aged animals. Prominent functional groups of age-and energy-sensitive genes are those encoding proteins involved in DNA damage responses, mitochondrial and proteasome functions, cell fate determination and synaptic vesicle traffi cking. The systematic transcriptome dataset provides a window into mechanisms of neuropathogenesis and CNS vulnerability. 24 With the advent of modern genomic technologies, new loci have been associated with different neuropsychiatric disorders, and novel pathogenic mechanisms have been postulated. Cryptic chromosome imbalances are increasingly acknowledged as a cause for mental retardation and learning disability. With subtelomeric screening, nine chromosomal anomalies and submicroscopic deletions of 1pter, 2qter, 4pter, 5qter and 9qter have been identifi ed in patients with mental retardation. 25 Increased DNA fragmentation was observed in non-GABAergic neurons in bipolar disorder, suggesting that non-GABAergic cell may be selectively vulnerable to oxidative stress and apoptosis in patients with bipolar disorder. 26 [17] [18] [19] [20] With laser microdissection, RNA amplifi cation, and array hybridization, expression of more than 1,000 genes was detected in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal neurons under normoxic conditions. The comparison of each region under normoxic and ischemic conditions revealed more than 5,000 ischemia-regulated genes for each individual cell type. 27 Microarray technology has helped to elucidate gene expression profi les and potential pathogenic mechanisms in many other CNS disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, [28] [29] [30] speech and language disorders, 31 Parkinson's disease, 32, 33 Huntington's disease, 34 prion disease, 35 drug addiction, 36,37 alcoholism, 38 brain trauma, 39 epilepsy, [40] [41] [42] Cockayne syndrome, 43 Rett syndrome, 44 Friedreich ataxia, 45 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, 46 multiple sclerosis, 47 amyotrophic lateral esclerosis, 48 acute pneumococcal meningitis, 49 and the role of lipids in brain injury, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. [50] [51] [52] Interactions between genomic factors and environmental factors have been proposed as important contributors for brain neuropathology. In schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental disturbances, neurotoxins and perinatal infections, myelin-and olygodendrocytes abnormalities and synaptic dysfunctions have been suggested as pathophysiological factors. Individual genotoxicants can induce distinct gene expression signatures. Exposure of the brain to environmental agents during critical periods of neuronal development can alter neuronal viability and differentiation, global gene expression, stress and immune response, and signal transduction. 53 The binomial genome-neurotoxicants effect can be documented in cases of drug abuse or alcohol dependence. Functional gene expression differences between inbred alcohol-preferring and nonpreferring rats suggest the presence of powerful genomic infl uences on alcohol dependence. 54 Alcohol dependence and associated cognitive impairment may result from neuroadaptations to chronic alcohol consumption involving changes in expression of multiple genes. It has been suggested that cycles of alcohol intoxication/withdrawal, which may initially activate nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), when repeated over years downregulate p65 (RELA) mRNA expression and NF-\u03baB and p50 homodimer DNA-binding. Downregulation of the dominant p50 homodimer, a potent inhibitor of gene transcription apparently results in depression of \u03baB regulated genes. Alterations in expression of p50 homodimer/NF-\u03baB regulated genes may contribute to neuroplastic adaptation underlying alcoholism. 55 Gene expression profi ling of the nucleus accumbens of cocaine abusers suggests a dysregulation of myelin. 56 Humans who abused cocaine, cannabis and/or phencyclidine share a decrease in transcription of calmodulin-related genes and increased transcription related to lipid/cholesterol and Golgi/ER function. 57 Another important issue in the pathogenesis and therapeutics of CNS disorders is the role of microR-NAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small (22 nucleotide), endogenous noncoding RNA molecules that posttranscriptionally regulate expression of protein-coding genes. Computational predictions estimate that the vertebrate genomes may contain up to 1,000 miRNA genes. miRNAs are generated from long primary transcripts that are processed in multiple steps to cytoplasmic 22 nucleotide mature miRNAs. The mature miRNA is incorporated into the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), which guides it to target sequences located in 3\u2032 UTRs where by incomplete base-pairing induce mRNA destabilization or translational repression of the target genes. An inventory of miRNA expression profi les from 13 regions of the mouse CNS has been reported. 58 This inventory of CNS miRNA profi les provides an important step toward further elucidation of miRNA function and miRNA-related gene regulatory networks in the mammalian CNS. 58", "cite_spans": [{"start": 263, "end": 265, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 266, "end": 267, "text": "9",

This kind of protocol should integrate the following components: (i) clinical history, (ii) laboratory tests, (iii) neuropsychological assessment, (iv) cardiovascular evaluation, (v) conventional X-ray technology, (vi) structural neuroimaging, (vii) functional neuroimaging, (viii) computerized brain electrophysiology, (ix) cerebrovascular evaluation, (x) structural genomics, (xi) functional genomics, (xii) pharmacogenetics, (xiii) pharmacogenomics, (ix) nutrigenetics, (x) nutrigenomics, (xi) bioinformatics for data management, and (xii) artifi cial intelligence procedures for diagnostic assignments and probabilistic therapeutic options (Table 40 .4). 2, 8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] 59, 60 All these procedures, under personalized strategies adapted to the complexity of each case, are essential to depict a clinical profi le based on specifi c biomarkers correlating with individual genomic profi les.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 896, "end": 898, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 899, "end": 901, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 902, "end": 906, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 907, "end": 911, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 912, "end": 916, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 917, "end": 921, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 922, "end": 926, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 927, "end": 931, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 932, "end": 936, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 937, "end": 940, "text": "59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 941, "end": 943, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 881, "end": 890, "text": "(Table 40", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Diagnostic Protocol in Neuropsychiatry"}, {"text": "Functional genomics studies have demonstrated the infl uence of many genes on CNS pathogenesis and phenotype expression (Tables 40.1-40. 3). Taking AD as an example, it has been demonstrated that mutations in the APP, PS1, PS2, and MAPT genes give rise to wellcharacterized differential neuropathological and clinical phenotypes of dementia. 8 The analysis of genotypephenotype correlations has also revealed that the presence of the APOE-4 allele in AD, in conjunction with other genes, infl uences disease onset, brain atrophy, cerebrovascular perfusion, blood pressure, \u03b2-amyloid deposition, ApoE secretion, lipid metabolism, brain bioelectrical activity, cognition, apoptosis, and treatment outcome. 8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] 61 The characterization of phenotypic profi les according to age, cognitive performance (MMSE and ADAS-Cog score), serum ApoE levels, serum lipid levels including cholesterol (CHO), HDL-CHO, LDL-CHO, VLDL-CHO, and triglyceride (TG) levels, as well as serum nitric oxide (NO), \u03b2-amyloid, and histamine levels, reveals sex-related differences in 25% of the biological parameters and almost no differences (0.24%) when patients are classifi ed as APOE-4(\u2212) and APOE-4(+) carriers, probably indicating that genderrelated factors may infl uence these parametric variables more powerfully than the presence or absence of the APOE-4 allele; in contrast, when patients are classifi ed according to their APOE genotype, dramatic differences emerge among APOE genotypes (>45%), with a clear biological disadvantage in APOE-4/4 carriers who exhibit (i) earlier age of onset, (ii) low ApoE levels, (iii) high CHO and LDL-CHO levels, and (iv) low NO, \u03b2-amyloid, and histamine levels in blood. 8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] 61 These phenotypic differences are less pronounced when AD patients are classifi ed according to their PS1 (15.6%) or ACE genotypes (23.52%), refl ecting a weak impact of PS1-and ACE-related genotypes on the phenotypic expression of biological markers in AD. PS1related genotypes appear to infl uence age of onset, blood histamine levels and cerebrovascular hemodynamics, as refl ected by signifi cant changes in systolic (Sv), diastolic (Dv), and mean velocities (Mv) in the left middle cerebral arteries (MCA). 19 ACE-related phenotypes seem to be more infl uential than PS1 genotypes in defi ning biological phenotypes, such as age of onset, cognitive performance, HDL-CHO levels, ACE and NO levels, and brain blood fl ow Mv in MCA. However, when APOE and PS1 genotypes are integrated in bigenic clusters and the resulting bigenic genotypes are differentiated according to their corresponding phenotypes, an almost logarithmic increased expression of differential phenotypes is observed (61.46% variation), indicating the existence of a synergistic effect of the bigenic (APOE + PS1) cluster on the expression of biological markers, apparently unrelated to APP/PS1 mutations, since none of the patients included in the sample were carriers of either APP or PS1 mutations. 19, 61, 62 These examples illustrate the potential additive effects of AD-related genes on the phenotypic expression of biological markers. Furthermore, the analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations with a monogenic or bigenic approach documents a modest genotype-related variation in serum amyloid-\u03b2 (ABP) levels, suggesting that peripheral levels of ABP are of relative value as predictors of disease-stage or as markers of disease progression and/ or treatment-related disease-modifying effects. 19, 61, 62 The peripheral levels of ABP in serum exhibit an APOE-dependent pattern according to which both APOE-4(+) and APOE-2(+) carriers tend to show higher ABP levels than APOE-4(\u2212) or APOE-3 carriers 19,61-63 ( Fig. 40 est concentration of serum histamine is systematically present in APOE-2(+) and APOE-4(+) carriers, and the highest levels of histamine are seen in APOE-3(+) carriers ( Fig. 40.3 ). Central and peripheral histaminergic mechanisms may regulate cerebrovascular function in AD, which is signifi cantly altered in APOE-4/4 carriers. 19, [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] These observations can lead to the conclusion that the simple quantifi cation of biochemical markers in fl uids or tissues of AD patients with the aim of identifying pathogenic mechanisms and/or monitoring therapeutic effects, when they are not accompanied by differential genotyping for sample homogenization, are of very poor value. Differential patterns of APOE-, PS1-, PS2-, and trigenic (APOE + PS1 + PS2) cluster-related lymphocyte apoptosis have been detected in AD. Fas receptor expression is signifi cantly increased in AD, especially in APOE-4 carriers where lymphocyte apoptosis is more relevant. 19, 67 It has been demonstrated that brain activity slowing correlates with progressive GDS staging in dementia 8, 16, [18] [19] [20] (Fig. 40.4 ). In the general population subjects harbouring the APOE-4/4 genotype exhibit a premature slowing in brain mapping activity represented by increased slow delta and theta activities as compared with other APOE genotypes.

Improvement in terms of clinical outcome, however, has fallen short of expectations, with up to one third of the patients continuing to experience clinical relapse or unacceptable medication-related side effects in spite of efforts to identify optimal treatment regimes with one or more drugs. 68 Potential reasons to explain this historical setback might be that: (a) the molecular pathology of most CNS disorders is still poorly understood; (b) drug targets are inappropriate, not fi tting into the real etiology of the disease; (c) most treatments are symptomatic, but not anti-pathogenic; (d) the genetic component of most CNS disorders is poorly defi ned; and (e) the understanding of genome-drug interactions is very limited.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 774, "end": 776, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics"}, {"text": "With the advent of recent knowledge on the human genome 69,70 and the identifi cation and characterization of many genes associated with CNS disorders, 8, 19 as well as novel data regarding CYP family genes and other genes whose enzymatic products are responsible for drug metabolism in the liver (e.g., NATs, ABCBs/ MDRs, TPMT), it has been convincingly postulated that the incorporation of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic procedures ( Fig. 40 .6) in drug development might bring about substantial benefi ts in terms of therapeutics optimization in CNS disorders and in many other complex disorders, assuming that genetic factors are determinant for both neuronal dysregulation (and/or neuronal death) 8,16-22 and drug metabolism. [71] [72] [73] Fig. 40.6 Effi cacy and safety issues associated with pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics (Adapted from R. Cacabelos 19, 20 ) However, this fi eld is still in its infancy; and the incorporation of pharmacogenomic strategies to drug development and pharmacological screening in CNS disorders is not an easy task. The natural course of technical events to achieve effi cient goals in pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics include the following steps: (a) genetic testing of mutant genes and/or polymorphic variants of risk; (b) genomic screening, and understanding of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic networks; (c) functional genomics studies and genotype-phenotype correlation analysis; and (d) pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics developments, addressing drug safety and effi cacy, respectively. 8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [74] [75] [76] [77] With pharmacogenetics we can understand how genomic factors associated with genes encoding enzymes responsible for drug metabolism regulate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (mostly safety issues). [78] [79] [80] With pharmacogenomics we can differentiate the specifi c disease-modifying effects of drugs (effi cacy issues) acting on pathogenic mechanisms directly linked to genes whose mutations determine the disease phenotype. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [74] [75] [76] [77] The capacity of drugs to reverse the effects of the activation of pathogenic cascades (phenotype expression) regulated by networking genes basically deals with effi cacy issues. At present, the terms pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are often used interchangeably to refer to studies of the contribution of inheritance to variation in the drug response phenotype 73 ; however, from historical and didactic reasons (until a more suitable and universal defi nition can be established) it would be preferable to maintain the term of pharmacogenetics for the discipline dealing with genetic factors associated with drug metabolism and safety issues, whereas pharmacogenomics would refer to the reciprocal infl uence of drugs and genomic factors on pathogenetic cascades and disease-associated gene expression (effi cacy issues). [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [74] [75] [76] [77] The application of these procedures to CNS disorders is a very diffi cult task, since most neuropsychiatric diseases are complex disorders in which hundreds of genes might be involved 8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [74] [75] [76] [77] (Tables 40.1-40.3 ). In addition, it is very unlikely that a single drug be able to reverse the multifactorial mechanisms associated with neuronal dysfunction in most CNS processes with a complex phenotype affecting mood, personality, behaviour, cognition, and functioning. This heterogeneous clinical picture usually requires the utilization of different drugs administered simultaneously. This is particularly important in the elderly population. In fact, the average number of drugs taken by patients with dementia ranges from six to more than ten per day depending upon their physical and mental conditions. Nursing home residents receive, on average, seven to eight medications each month, and more than 30% of residents have monthly drug regimes of nine or more medications, including (in descending order) analgesics, antipyretics, gastrointestinal agents, electrolytic and caloric preparations, central nervous system (CNS) agents, anti-infective agents, and cardiovascular agents. 81 In population-based studies more than 35% of patients older than 85 years are moderate or chronic antidepressant users. 82 Polypharmacy, drug-drug interactions, adverse reactions, and non-compliance are substantial therapeutic problems in the pharmacological management of elderly patients, 83 adding further complications and costs to the patients and their caregivers. In 2000-2001, 23.0-36.5% of elderly individuals received at least 1 of 33 potentially inappropriate medications in ten health maintenance organizations (HMOs) of the USA. 84 Although drug effect is a complex phenotype that depends on many factors, it is estimated that genetics accounts for 20-95% of variability in drug disposition and pharmacodynamics. 79 Under these circumstances, therapeutics optimization is a major goal in neuropsychiatric disorders and in the elderly population, and novel pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic procedures may help in this endeavour.

About 60-80% of the psychotropic agents currently used for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders are metabolized via enzymes of the CYP family, especially CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (Table 40 .5). CYP3A4 metabolizes more drug molecules than all other isoforms together. Most of these polymorphisms exhibit geographic and ethnic differences. [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] These differences infl uence drug metabolism in different ethnic groups in which drug dosage should be adjusted according to their enzymatic capacity, differentiating normal or extensive metabolizers (EMs), poor metabolizers (PMs) and ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs). Most drugs act as substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP enzymes. Enzyme induction enables some xenobiotics to accelerate their own biotransformation (auto-induction) or the biotransformation and elimination of other drugs. A number of P450 enzymes in human liver are inducible. Induction of the majority of P450 enzymes occurs by increase in the rate of gene transcription and involves ligand-activated transcription factors, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and pregnane X receptor (PXR). 93, 95 In general, binding of the appropriate ligand to the receptor initiates the induction process that cascades through a dimerization of the receptors, their translocation to the nucleus and binding to specifi c regions in the promoters of CYPs. 95 CYPs are also expressed in the CNS, and a complete characterization of constitutive and induced CYPs in brain is essential for understanding the role of these enzymes in neurobiological functions and in age-related and xenobiotic-induced neurotoxicity. 96 Assuming that the human genome contains about 20,000-30,000 genes, at the present time only 0.31% of commercial drugs have been assigned to corresponding genes whose gene products might be involved in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activities of a given drug; and only 4% of the human genes have been assigned to a particular drug metabolic pathway. Supposing a theoretical number of 100,000 chemicals in current use worldwide, and assuming that practically all human genes can interact with drugs taken by human beings, each gene in the human genome should be involved in the metabolism and/or biopharmacological effect of 30-40 drugs; however, assuming that most xenobiotic substances in contact with our organism can infl uence genomic function, it might be possible that for 1,000,000 xenobiotics in daily contact with humans, an average of 350-500 xenobiotics have to be assigned to each one of the genes potentially involved in drug metabolism and/or xenobiotics processing. To fulfi l this task a single gene has to possess the capacity of metabolizing many different xenobiotic substances and at the same time many different genes have to cooperate in orchestrated networks to metabolize a particular drug or xenobiotic under sequential biotransformation steps (Figs. 40.7 and 40.8). Numerous chemicals increase the metabolic capability of organisms by their ability to activate genes encoding various xenochemical-metabolizing enzymes, such as CYPs, transferases and transporters. Many natural and artifi cial substances induce the hepatic CYP subfamilies in humans, and these inductions might lead to clinically important drug-drug interactions. Some of the key cellular receptors that mediate such inductions have been recently identifi ed, including nuclear receptors, such as the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3), the retinoid X receptor (RXR, NR2B1), the pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I3), and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, NR1I1) and steroid receptors such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, NR3C1). 97 There is a wide promiscuity of these receptors in the induction of CYPs in response to xenobiotics. Indeed, this adaptive system acts as an effective network where receptors share partners, ligands, DNA response elements and target genes, infl uencing their mutual relative expression. 97,98", "cite_spans": [{"start": 557, "end": 561, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 562, "end": 566, "text": "[89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 567, "end": 571, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 572, "end": 576, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 577, "end": 581, "text": "[92]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 582, "end": 586, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 587, "end": 591, "text": "[94]", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1389, "text": "93,", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1392, "text": "95", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1638, "text": "95", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1894, "text": "96", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 3927, "end": 3929, "text": "97", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 398, "end": 407, "text": "(Table 40", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "The CYP Gene Family"}, {"text": "The most important enzymes of the P450 cytochrome family in drug metabolism by decreasing order are CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2A6.

[16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [74] [75] [76] [77] 109, 110 Taking into consideration the available data, it might be inferred that at least 15% of the AD population may exhibit an abnormal metabolism of cholinesterase inhibitors and/or other drugs which undergo oxidation via CYP2D6-related enzymes. Approximately 50% of this population cluster would show an ultrarapid metabolism, requiring higher doses of cholinesterase inhibitors to reach a therapeutic threshold, whereas the other 50% of the cluster would exhibit a poor metabolism, displaying potential adverse events at low doses. If we take into account that approximately 60-70% of therapeutic outcomes depend upon pharmacogenomic criteria (e.g., pathogenic mechanisms associated with AD-related genes), it can be postulated that pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic factors are responsible for 75-85% of the therapeutic response (effi cacy) in AD patients treated with conventional drugs. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [74] [75] [76] [77] 109, 110 Of particular interest are the potential interactions of cholinesterase inhibitors with other drugs of current use in patients with AD, such as antidepressants, neuroleptics, antiarrhythmics, analgesics, and antiemetics which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 enzyme. 111 Although most studies predict the safety of donepezil 112 and galantamine, 107 as the two principal cholinesterase inhibitors metabolized by CYP2D6-related enzymes, 113, 114 no pharmacogenetic studies have been performed so far on an individual basis to personalize the treatment, and most studies reporting safety issues are the result of pooling together pharmacological and clinical information obtained with routine procedures. 103, [115] [116] [117] In certain cases, genetic polymorphism in the expression of CYP2D6 is not expected to affect the pharmacodynamics of some cholinesterase inhibitors because major meta-bolic pathways are glucuronidation, O-demethylation, N-demethylation, N-oxidation, and epimerization. However, excretion rates are substantially different in EMs and PMs. For instance, in EMs, urinary metabolites resulting from O-demethylation of galantamine represent 33.2% of the dose compared with 5.2% in PMs, which show correspondingly higher urinary excretion of unchanged galantamine and its N-oxide. 118 Therefore, still there are many unanswered questions regarding the metabolism of cholinesterase inhibitors and their interaction with other drugs (potentially leading to ADRs) which require pharmacogenetic elucidation. It is also worth to mention that dose titration (a common practice in AD patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors; e.g., tacrine, donepezil) is an unwise strategy, since approximately 30-60% of drug failure or lack of therapeutic effi cacy (and/or ADR manifestation) is not a matter of drug dosage but a problem of poor metabolizing capacity in PMs. Additionally, inappropriate drug use is one of the risk factors for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the elderly. The prevalence of use of potentially inappropriate medications in patients older than 65 years of age admitted to a general medical or geriatric ward ranges from 16% to 20%, 119 and these numbers may double in ambulatory patients. Overall, the most prevalent inappropriate drugs currently prescribed to the elderly are amiodarone, long-acting benzodiazepines and anticholinergic antispasmodics; however, the list of drugs with potential risk also include antidepressant, antihistaminics, NSAIDs, amphetamines, laxatives, clonidine, indomethacin, and several neuroleptics, 119 most of which are processed via CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 enzymes. 120 Therefore, pre-treatment CYP screening might be of great help to rationalize and optimize therapeutics in the elderly, by avoiding medications of risk in PMs and UMs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 587, "end": 588, "text": "(", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 994, "end": 997, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1001, "text": "77,", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1005, "text": "109", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1630, "end": 1643, "text": "Cacabelos 77,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1647, "text": "109", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 2588, "end": 2592, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2593, "end": 2597, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2598, "end": 2602, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2603, "end": 2607, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2608, "end": 2612, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2613, "end": 2617, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2618, "end": 2622, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2623, "end": 2627, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2628, "end": 2632, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2633, "end": 2637, "text": "109,", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 2638, "end": 2641, "text": "110", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 3531, "end": 3535, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3536, "end": 3540, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3541, "end": 3545, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3546, "end": 3550, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3551, "end": 3555, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3556, "end": 3560, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 3561, "end": 3565, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 3566, "end": 3570, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 3571, "end": 3575, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 3576, "end": 3580, "text": "109,", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 3581, "end": 3584, "text": "110", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 3865, "end": 3868, "text": "111", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 4034, "end": 4038, "text": "113,", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 4039, "end": 4042, "text": "114", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 4301, "end": 4305, "text": "103,", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 4306, "end": 4311, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 4312, "end": 4317, "text": "[116]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 4318, "end": 4323, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 4899, "end": 4902, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 5767, "end": 5770, "text": "119", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 6165, "end": 6168, "text": "119", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 6228, "end": 6231, "text": "120", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 589, "end": 600, "text": "(Fig. 40.10", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1498, "text": "Fig. 40", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "CYP2D6-Related Therapeutic Response to a Multifactorial Treatment in Dementia"}, {"text": "There are substantial differences between individuals in the effects of psychotropic drugs in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Of all genes affecting drug metabolism, effi cacy and safety, the CYP gene family is the most relevant since more than 60% of CNS drugs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. [122] [123] [124] Approximately, 18% of neuroleptics are major substrates of CYP1A2 enzymes, 40% of CYP2D6, and 23% of CYP3A4; 24% of antidepressants are major substrates of CYP1A2 enzymes, 5% of CYP2B6, 38% of CYP2C19, 85% of CYP2D6, and 38% of CYP3A4; 7% of benzodiazepines are major substrates of CYP2C19 enzymes, 20% of CYP2D6, and 95% of CYP3A4 (Table 40 .5).

[125] [126] [127] Furthermore, conventional targets for psychotropic drugs were the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, GABA, ion channels, acetylcholine and their respective biosynthetic and catalyzing enzymes, receptors and transporters 121 ; however, in the past few years many different genes have been associated with both pathogenesis and pharmacogenomics of neuropsychiatric disorders. Some of these genes and their products constitute potential targets for future treatments. New developments in genomics, including whole genome genotyping approaches and comprehensive information on genomic variation across populations, coupled with large-scale clinical trials in which DNA collection is routine, now provide the impetus for a next generation of pharmacogenetic studies and identifi cation of novel candidate drugs. [139] [140] [141] Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a family of enzymes that degrade cAMP and cGMP. Intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels increase in response to neurotransmitters and are down-regulated through hydrolysis catalyzed by PDEs, which are therefore candidate therapeutic targets. cAMP is a second messenger involved in learning, memory, and mood, and cGMP modulates brain processes that are controlled by the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP pathway. The analysis of SNPs in 21 genes of this superfamily revealed that polymorphisms in PDE9A and PDE11A are associated with major depressive disorder. In addition, remission on antidepressants was associated with polymorphisms in PDE1A and PDE11A. According to these results, it has been postulated that PDE11A (haplotype GAACC) has a role in the pathogenesis of major depression. 142 Another example is the purinergic receptor gene P2RX(7), located in a major linkage hotspot for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (12q21-33), which has been associated with bipolar disorder, but nine functionally characterized variants of P2RX(7) did not show association with schizophrenia. 143 The possible role of a tag SNP (the 1359G/A polymorphism) of the gene encoding the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CNR1) has been investigated in schizophrenics treated with atypical antipsychotics. No difference in 1359G/A polymorphism was observed between patients and control subjects, and no relation-ships were noted between this polymorphism and any clinical parameter considered as potential intermediate factor; however, the G allele was signifi cantly higher among non-responders vs. responsive patients, suggesting that the G allele of the CNR1 gene could be a pharmacogenetic rather than a vulnerability factor for schizophrenics. 144 Synaptic dysfunction is a potential pathogenic factor in schizophrenia. Cholesterol is an essential component of myelin and has proved important for synapse formation and lipid raft function. It has been demonstrated that the antipsychotic drugs clozapine and haloperidol stimulate lipogenic gene expression in glioma cells in culture through activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors. Recently, the action of chlorpromazine, haloperidol, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and ziprasidone on SREBP and SREBP-controlled gene expression (acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, ACAT2; 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, HMGCR; 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1, HMGCS1; FDPS; sterol-C5-desaturase like, SC5DL; 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, DHCR7; low density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR; fatty acid synthase; farsenyl diphosphate synthase, FASN; stearoyl-CoA desaturase, delta-9-desaturase, SCD1) has been investigated in different CNS human cell lines, demonstrating that antipsychotic-induced activation of lipogenesis is most prominent in glial cells and that this mechanism could be relevant for the therapeutic efficacy of some antipsychotic drugs. 145 RGS2 (regulator of G-protein signaling 2) modulates dopamine receptor signal transduction. Functional variants of this gene (RGS2-rs 4606 C/G) may infl uence susceptibility to extrapyramidal symptoms induced by antipsychotic drugs. This SNP is located in the 3\u2032-regulatory region of the gene, and is known to infl uence RGS2 mRNA levels and protein expression. 146 Furthermore, RGS4 (regulator of G protein signaling 4) genotypes predict both the severity at baseline symptoms and relative responsiveness to antipsychotic medication. 147 Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary movements predominantly in the orofacial region and develops in approximately 20% of patients during long-term treatment with typical antipsychotics. Polymorphic variants of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and DRD3 genes have been associated with tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenics. 148, 149 In contrast, the haplotype T-4b-Glu of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) gene (-786T > C in the promoter region, 27-bp variable number of tandem repeats in intron 4, Glu298Asp in exon 7) might represent a protective haplotype against tardive dyskinesia after long-term antipsychotic treatment. 150 The T102C variant in the serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A) and the Ser9Gly variant in the dopamine D3 receptor (DRD3) were associated with a risperidone response to exacerbated schizophrenia. The patients with T/T in the HTR2A gene show less clinical improvement than do those with T/C or C/C. The C allele is more frequent in responders. When combinations of both polymorphisms are considered, patients who have T/T in the HTR2A gene and encode Ser/Ser or Ser/Gly from DRD3 gene have a higher propensity to non-responsiveness compared to other subjects, suggesting that the HTR2A T102C variant could be a potential indicator of clinical improvement after risperidone treatment. 151 There is a signifi cant relationship between a promoter region polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene and antidepressant response, as well as for associations between candidate neurotransmitter receptor genes and second generation antipsychotic drug response. 121 Polymorphic variants of several serotonin receptor subtypes seem to be involved in the efficacy and symptomatic response of schizophrenic patients to atypical antipsychotics. For instance, the \u22121019 C/G polymorphism of the HTR1A receptor gene is associated with negative symptom response to risperidone in schizophrenics. 152 Interaction between COMT and NOTCH4 genotypes may also predict the treatment response to typical neuroleptics in patients with schizophrenia. 153 The effi cacy of iloperidone in patients with schizophrenia has been associated with the homozygous condition for the rs1800169 G/G genotype of the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) gene. 154 Dopamine receptor interacting proteins (DRIPs) are pivotally involved in regulating dopamine receptor signal transduction. Two SNPs in the dopamine receptor interacting protein gene, NEF3, which encodes the DRIP, neurofi lament-medium (NF-M), were associated with early response (rs1457266, rs1379357). A 5 SNP haplotype spanning NEF3 was over-represented in early responders. Since NEF3 is primarily associated with dopamine D1 receptor function, it is likely that both genes cooperate in eliciting genotype-specifi c antipsychotic response. 155 The improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscore was found signifi cantly greater in patients homozygous for the A1287 allele of the SLC6A2 (Solute Carrier Family 6 (Noradrenaline Transporter), Member 2) gene, and smaller in patients homozygous for the C-182 allele of the SLC6A2 gene, suggesting that these polymorphisms of the noradrenaline transporter gene are specifi cally involved in the variation of positive symptoms in schizophrenia. 156 Weight gain is a problem commonly found in patients treated with neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, and some antiepileptics (e.g., valproic acid). The adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin, has been associated with body weight and energy homeostasis, and abnormal regulation of leptin could play a role in weight gain induced by antipsychotics. The leptin gene promoter variant G2548A was associated with clozapine-induced weight in Chinese patients with chronic schizophrenia. 157 Likewise, studies in Caucasians suggest that genetic vulnerability in the leptin gene (\u22121548G/A) and leptin receptor (Q223R) may predispose some individuals to excessive weight gain from increased exposure to olanzapine. 158, 159 The development of selective type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu5) antagonists, such as 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) and 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]-pyridine (MTEP), has demonstrated the potential involvement of these receptors in several CNS disorders including depression, anxiety, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, drug addiction, and alcoholism. Treatment with MPEP and MTEP can induce gene expression related to ATP synthesis, hydrolase activity, and signaling pathways associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the frontal cortex, this constituting another potential therapeutic target in some neuropsychiatric disorders. 160 A new marker (rs1954787) in the GRIK4 gene, which codes for the kainic acid-type glutamate receptor KA1, has been associated with response to the antidepressant citalopram, suggesting that the glutamate system plays a role in modulating response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). 161 Glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3B) activity is increased in the brain of patients with major depressive disorders. Inhibition of GSK3B is thought to be a key feature in the therapeutic mechanism of antidepressants. Four polymorphisms of the GSK3B gene [rs334555 (\u221250 T > C); rs13321783 (IVS7 + 9227 A > G); rs2319398 (IVS + 11660 G > T); rs6808874 (IVS + 4251 T > A)] have been genotyped in Chinese patients with major depression. GSK3B TAGT carriers showed poorer response to antidepressants. 162 Lithium has been used for over 40 years as an effective prophylactic agent in bipolar disorder. Response to lithium treatment seems to be, at least in part, genetically determined. It has been suggested that lithium exerts an effect on signal transduction pathways, such as the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. Association studies in patients with bipolar disorders revealed that CREB1-1H SNP (G/A change at 2q32.3-q34) and CREB1-7H (T/C change) may be associated with bipolar disorder and lithium response. 163 DNA oligonucleotide microarrays have been used to evaluate gene expression in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Sporadic PD is characterized by progressive death of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra, where cell death is not uniform. The lateral tier of the substantia nigra (SNL) degenerates earlier and more severely than the more medial nigral component (SNM). Genes expressed more highly in the PD SNL included the cell death gene, p53 effector related to PMP22, the TNFR gene, TNFR superfamily, member 21, and the mitochondrial complex I gene, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1-beta subcomplex, 3, 12 kDa (NDUF\u03b23). Genes that were more highly expressed in PD SNM included the dopamine cell signaling gene, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein, 21 kDa, the activated macrophage gene, stabilin 1, and two glutathione peroxidase (GPX) genes, GPX1 and GPX3. This gene expression profi le reveals that there is increased expression of genes encoding pro-infl ammatory cytokines and subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in glial cells, and that there is a decreased expression of several glutathione-related genes in the GNL, suggesting a molecular basis for pathoclisis. 164 These fi ndings may contribute to open new therapeutic avenues in PD, where glial cells might represent potential targets to halt disease progression.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 171, "text": "[125]", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 172, "end": 177, "text": "[126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 178, "end": 183, "text": "[127]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1015, "text": "[139]", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1021, "text": "[140]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1027, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1859, "text": "142", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 2153, "end": 2156, "text": "143", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 2796, "end": 2799, "text": "144", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 4035, "end": 4038, "text": "145", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 4400, "end": 4403, "text": "146", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 4573, "end": 4576, "text": "147", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 4897, "end": 4901, "text": "148,", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 4902, "end": 4905, "text": "149", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 5211, "end": 5214, "text": "150", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 5890, "end": 5893, "text": "151", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 6162, "end": 6165, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 6488, "end": 6491, "text": "152", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 6634, "end": 6637, "text": "153", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 6827, "end": 6830, "text": "154", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 7374, "end": 7377, "text": "155", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 7858, "end": 7861, "text": "156", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 8342, "end": 8345, "text": "157", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 8567, "end": 8571, "text": "158,", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}, {"start": 8572, "end": 8575, "text": "159", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 9252, "end": 9255, "text": "160", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 9554, "end": 9557, "text": "161", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 10053, "end": 10056, "text": "162", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 10579, "end": 10582, "text": "163", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 11835, "end": 11838, "text": "164", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Novel Targets in the Pharmacogenomics of CNS Disorders"}, {"text": "Pharmacological inhibition of cyclic-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) protects neurons under distinct stressful conditions.

(ii) In our personal experience the best results have been obtained combining (a) CDP-choline with piracetam and metabolic supplementation, (b) CDP-choline with piracetam and anapsos, (c) CDP-choline with piracetam and cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine), (d) CDP-choline with memantine, and (e) CDPcholine, piracetam and nicergoline. (iii) Some of these combination therapies have proven to be effective, improving cognition during the fi rst 9 months of treatment, and not showing apparent side-effects. (iv) The therapeutic response in AD seems to be genotypespecifi c under different pharmacogenomic conditions. (v) In monogenic-related studies, patients with the APOE-2/3 and APOE-3/4 genotypes are the best responders, and APOE-4/4 carriers are the worst responders ( Fig. 40.11 ). (vi) PS1-and PS2-related genotypes do not appear to infl uence the therapeutic response in AD as independent genomic entities; however, APP, PS1, and PS2 mutations may drastically modify the therapeutic response to conventional drugs. (vii) In trigenic-related studies the best responders are those patients carrying the 331222-, 341122-, 341222-, and 441112-genomic clusters. (viii) A genetic defect in the exon 5 of the PS2 gene seems to exert a negative effect on cognition conferring PS2+ carriers in trigenic clusters the condition of poor responders to combination therapy. (ix) The worst responders in all genomic clusters are patients with the 441122+ genotype. (x) The APOE-4/4 genotype seems to accelerate neurodegeneration anticipating the onset of the disease by 5-10 years; and, in general, APOE-4/4 carriers show a faster disease progression and a poorer therapeutic response to all available treatments than any other polymorphic variant. (xi) Pharmacogenomic studies using trigenic, tetragenic or polygenic clusters as a harmonization procedure to reduce genomic heterogeneity are very useful to widen the therapeutic scope of limited pharmacological resources.

The best responders were APOE-2/4 > APOE-2/3 > APOE-3/3 > APOE-3/4 carriers (Fig. 40.13) .

Despite the effort of the pharmaceutical industry to demonstrate the benefi ts and cost-effectiveness of available drugs, the general impression in the medical community and in some governments is that some psychotropics and most anti-dementia drugs present in the market are not costeffective. 20, [74] [75] [76] [77] 109 Conventional drugs for neuropsychi-atric disorders are relatively simple compounds with unreasonable prices. Some new products are not superior to conventional antidepressants, neuroleptics, and anxiolytics. There is an urgent need to assess the costs of new trials with pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics strategies, and to implement pharmacogenetic procedures to predict drug-related adverse events. 20, 74, 75, 109 Cost-effectiveness analysis has been the most commonly applied framework for evaluating pharmacogenetics. Pharmacogenetic testing is potentially relevant to large populations that incur in high costs. For instance, the most commonly drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 account for 189 million prescriptions and US$12.8 billion annually in expenditures in the US, which represent 5-10% of total utilization and expenditures for outpatient prescription drugs. 196 Pharmacogenomics offer great potential to improve patients' health in a cost-effective manner; however, pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics will not be applied to all drugs available in the market, and careful evaluations should be done on a case-by-case basis prior to investing resources in R&D of pharmacogenomic-based therapeutics and making reimbursement decisions. 197 In performing pharmacogenomic studies in CNS disorders, it is necessary to rethink the therapeutic expectations of novel drugs, redesign the protocols for drug clinical trials, and incorporate biological markers as assessable parameters of effi cacy and prevention. In addition to the characterization of genomic profi les, phenotypic profi ling of responders and non-responders to conventional drugs is also important (and currently neglected). Brain imaging techniques, computerized electrophysiology, and optical topography in combination with genotyping of polygenic clusters can help in the differentiation of responders and non-responders. The early identifi cation of predictive risks requires genomic screening and molecular diagnosis, and individualized preventive programs will only be achieved when pharmacogenomic/pharmacogenetic protocols are incorporated to the clinical armamentarium with powerful bioinformatics support. 18-20,74,75.109 An important issue in AD therapeutics is that antidementia drugs should be effective in covering the clinical spectrum of dementia symptoms represented by memory defi cits, behavioural changes, and functional decline. It is diffi cult (or impossible) that a single drug be able to fulfi l this criteria. A potential solution to this problem is the implementation of cost-effective, multifactorial (combination) treatments integrating several drugs, taking into consideration that traditional neuroleptics and novel antipsychotics (and many other psychotropics) deteriorate both cognitive and psychomotor functions in the elderly and may also increase the risk of stroke. 198 Few studies with combination treatments have been reported and most of them are poorly designed. We have also to realize that the vast majority of dementia cases in people older than 75-80% are of a mixed type, in which the cerebrovascular component associated with neurodegeneration can not be therapeutically neglected. In most cases of dementia, the multifactorial (combination) therapy appears to be the most effective strategy. [18] [19] [20] [74] [75] [76] [77] 109 The combination of several drugs (neuroprotectants, vasoactive substances, AChEIs, metabolic supplementation) increases the direct costs (e.g., medication) by 5-10%, but in turn, annual global costs are reduced by approximately 18-20% and the average survival rate increases about 30% (from 8 to 12 years post-diagnosis).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 370, "end": 373, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 374, "end": 378, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 379, "end": 383, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 384, "end": 388, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 389, "end": 393, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 394, "end": 397, "text": "109", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1048, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1053, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1058, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1063, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1068, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1072, "text": "109", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1478, "end": 1481, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1482, "end": 1485, "text": "74,", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1489, "text": "75,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1490, "end": 1493, "text": "109", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1947, "text": "196", "ref_id": "BIBREF191"}, {"start": 3258, "end": 3273, "text": "18-20,74,75.109", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3945, "end": 3948, "text": "198", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 4382, "end": 4386, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 4387, "end": 4391, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4392, "end": 4396, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4397, "end": 4401, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 4402, "end": 4406, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 4407, "end": 4411, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 4412, "end": 4416, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 4417, "end": 4420, "text": "109", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and Future Directions"}, {"text": "There are major concerns regarding the validity of clinical trials in patients with severe dementia.
