"BACKGROUND. Mathematical coupling may explain why cardiac filling volumes obtained by transpulmonary thermodilution may better predict and monitor responses of cardiac output to fluid loading than pressures obtained by pulmonary artery catheters (PAC). METHODS. Eleven consecutive patients with hypovolaemia after coronary surgery and a PAC, allowing central venous pressure (CVP) and continuous cardiac index (CCIp) measurements, received a femoral artery catheter for transpulmonary thermodilution measurements of global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) and cardiac index (CItp). One to five fluid loading steps of 250 mL were done in each patient (n = 48 total). RESULTS. Fluid responses were predicted and monitored similarly by CItp and CCIp, whereas CItp and CCIp correlated at r = 0.70 (p \\ 0.001) with a bias of 0.40 L min -1 m -2 . Changes in volumes (and not in CVP) related to changes in CItp and not in CCIp. Changes in CVP and GEDVI similarly related to changes in CItp, after elimination of two patients with greatest CItp outliers (as compared to CCIp). Changes in GEDVI correlated better to changes in CItp when derived from the same thermodilution curve than to changes in CItp of unrelated curves and changes in CCIp. CONCLUSIONS. After coronary surgery, fluid responses can be similarly assessed by intermittent transpulmonary and continuous pulmonary thermodilution methods, in spite of overestimation of CCIp by CItp. Filling pressures are poor monitors of fluid responses and superiority of GEDVI can be caused, at least in part, by mathematical coupling when cardiac volume and output are derived from the same thermodilution curve.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Bland-Altman plot for cardiac index measurements with help of the transpulmonary (CItp) and pulmonary (CCIp) continuous thermodilution techniques Scatterplots showing relationship between the fluid-induced changes of global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) and transpulmonary (panel A) or pulmonary continuous (panel B) thermodilution techniques OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the effects of active mechanical circulatory support on sublingual microcirculation as a model for body tissue perfusion. METHODS. Between May 2008 and January 2009, nine consecutive patients received a mechanical support device (HeartMate II, TandemHeart, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) for end-stage chronic heart failure or cardiogenic shock. Microcirculation was investigated using a hand-held sidestream dark field imaging device. Perfused capillary density (PCD) and capillary red blood cell velocity (cRBCv) were assessed before device implantation (T0), immediately after implantation (T1), and one day post implantation (T2). Data are presented as median (interquartile range). RESULTS. Median age of the patients was 44 (37-54) years and 67% were male. Circulatory support devices significantly decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p = 0.04).

This large between-study variation can be attributed to difference in definitions but also to incorrect estimation by standard statistical methods, i.e. inappropriate adjustment for informative censoring and time dependent confounders. The aim of this study was to take into account above statistical shortcomings and to assess the excess risk of VAP by using an extension of a recently developed techniques from the field of causal inference [2] . MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data was retrieved from a large longitudinal, high quality multi-centric ICU database from France (OUTCOMEREA). A random sample of consecutive patients ventilated [48 h from 17 ICUs over a 10 year period were included. VAP was defined as clinical suspicion plus at least one positive proximal or distal sampling with quantitative count using classical thresholds. Only the first VAP episode was taken into account. We considered discharge from the ICU as a competing risk and estimated the attributable 30-day ICU mortality of VAP by comparing the counterfactual cumulative incidence of death for the entire population under different hypothetical infection paths. Baseline characteristics indicating underlying co-morbidity and longitudinal (daily measured) severity of illness indicators together with all other known confounders until VAP developed were taken into account through the use of a marginal structural model [2] . RESULTS. A total of 4,333 ICU patients were included. Mean (SD) age and SAPS II score were 63 (17) and 49 (18), respectively. Seventeen and 21% were admitted after scheduled and emergency surgery respectively, 62% were medical patients. Forty-two percent had an underlying chronic illness (Knaus). Nine percent received dialysis in the ICU. A total of 647 (15%) patients developed VAP within 30 days of admission (48 and 82% within 7 and 14 days, respectively). Crude ICU-mortality rates in patients with and without VAP were 35 and 25%, respectively. When taking into account all the confounders, we found a 3.5% increase (95% CI 1. 7-5.3 , p = 0.0002) in the hazard of 30-day ICU-death per additional day since the development of VAP. Provided VAP could have been prevented in the whole population 30-day mortality would have decreased by 0.7%. CONCLUSION. The excess risk of death from VAP estimated by marginal structural models is lower than commonly reported in the literature. This indicates that underlying comorbidities and the evolution of severity of illness until VAP are insufficiently taken into account by current standard statistical methods. REFERENCE (S) . 1. Rello et al (2003) INTRODUCTION. The intensive care society (UK) has recently published national guidelines regarding many aspects of percutaneous tracheostomy management [1] , however, these guidelines do not make any recommendations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis during the procedure. We recently audited UK practice and have established that only 9% of the units give prophylactic antibiotics for patients known to be colonised with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The low rate of antibiotic use is surprising given that pneumonia and/ or bacteraemia following PT is frequently caused by organisms (non-MRSA) that colonise the patients' skin and/or airway [2, 3] . OBJECTIVE. To establish the incidence of MRSA positive sputum and/or blood cultures following PT in patients colonised with MRSA in their nose or throat. METHODS. We audited all the patients who had PT performed between 2005 and 2009 who were known to be colonised with MRSA in their nose or throat, (but who had negative sputum cultures) before PT was undertaken. We wanted to find how many of these patients developed MRSA positive sputum and/or blood cultures in the first week following their PT. RESULTS. From a total of 2004 patients admitted to critical care between 2004 and 2009 only seven MRSA colonised patients required PT. All of these 7 patients had MRSA colonised throat or nose with negative sputum and blood cultures prior to the PT. No patients were given prophylactic antibiotics during the PT as this was our standard practice. Four (57%) developed MRSA positive sputum cultures in the first week following the procedure. One (14%) developed MRSA bacteraemia on day 4 following PT. Over the same period there were no case of MRSA bacteraemia in the 118 MRSA colonised patients who did not undergo PT.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 150, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 596, "end": 599, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1551, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2188, "end": 2193, "text": "7-5.3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2723, "end": 2726, "text": "(S)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2732, "end": 2750, "text": "Rello et al (2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2903, "end": 2906, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3407, "end": 3410, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3411, "end": 3413, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION."}, {"text": "Microbiology Bacterial biofilm has been observed in the surface of the endotracheal tube (ETT) in mechanically ventilated patients and recent studies relate the presence of biofilm with the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

ISD of secretions reduces the incidence of VAP in patients receiving. CSS alone, or in combination with ISD has no significant effect on incidence of VAP.

BACKGROUND. Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a novel electronic ventilator protocol that incorporates the recent and sophisticated measurement tools and algorithms. The target tidal volume and respiratory rate are continually adapted to patient's respiratory physics and varying medical conditions. In injured lung, the ASV should actively adjust ventilatory parameters achieving minimal work of breathing to meet the lung protective strategies. But there were little literatures describing its efficacy when applied to Korean population.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "METHODS. From May 2008 to January 2009, we observed initial mechanical ventilation parameters in 114 patients receiving ASV due to various causes (48 lung injuries including 27 community acquired pneumonia, 9 hospital acquired pneumonia, 5 interstitial lung diseases, 4 pulmonary tuberculosis and 3 idiopathic cases; 66 without lung injury which comprise 33 trauma cases, 18 strokes, 9 suicidal attempts and 6 other cases). The mean age of studied population was 57.5 years (male:female = 42:15). The data were collected within the first 12 h of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION. As expected, adaptive support ventilation delivered smaller tidal volume and higher respiratory rates for injured lungs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "ASV efficiently operated in Korean ALI patients without any serious drawbacks and favorably adjusted the tidal volume and respiratory rates combination in relation with RCexp to meet lung protective strategies. INTRODUCTION. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a mode of mechanical ventilation that uses the electrical activity of the diaphragm to control the ventilator obtaining an improved patient-ventilator synchrony and an efficient unloading of the respiratory muscles. NAVA is characterised by a variability of the breathing pattern and the absence of a constant flow, which makes impossible the determination of reliable data of respiratory mechanics by using the rapid occlusion method. We have previously demonstrated that the least squares fitting method (LSF) could be used during pressure support ventilation (PSV), provided that the level of PS is sufficiently high to unload the inspiratory muscle. Hence we made the hypothesis that (1) reliable data of respiratory mechanics can be obtained by applying the LSF method during NAVA and (2) the LSF method should work better during NAVA because of the characteristics of the flow and pressure traces.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "METHODS. Ten patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure were enrolled. They were ventilated using randomly either PSV or NAVA with the the same PEEPe and tidal volume (V T ). Data of resistance (R rs ), elastance (E rs ) and total positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP tot ) were obtained by fitting the equation Paw = R rs 9 V 0 ? V T / C rs ? PEEP tot during inspiration, because of the possible presence of expiratory flow limitation. The coefficient of determination (CD) of the applied equation was used to compare data obtained during NAVA and PSV, the higher being the CD, the better the quality of the data.

(2) The CD obtained at every level of NAVA was always higher then 0.96. On the contrary, the CD obtained at low level of PSV was less than 0.90 due to the presence of inspiratory muscle activity.

The application of the LSF method during NAVA allows calculation of reliable data of Rrs, Ers and PEEPtot, which are independent of the level of NAVA applied. This is of clinical relevance since PSV allows calculation of reliable data only at high level of pressure support. It appears that the influence of inspiratory muscle activity on respiratory mechanics is less relevant during NAVA ventilation, suggesting a more physiological ventilation during NAVA both in terms of timing and of delivering adequate level of assist throughout each breath. INTRODUCTION. NAVA is a new spontaneous-assisted ventilatory mode based on the detection of diaphragmatic electrical activity (Eadi) and its feedback to adjust ventilator settings. NAVA uses the Eadi, an expression of the respiratory center's activity, to initiate pressurization, set the level of pressure support and cycle the ventilator into exhalation.

Each ICU of university hospitals is endeavoring to increase the number of intensivists. One of the popular methods is the announcement on web site to promote interest of young fellows. Regrettably, the homepage of the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine has no such specific pages. Each ICU of university hospitals has to create attractive its own pages in the homepages of the hospitals. [1] .

INTRODUCTION. Accurate data on patient's weight and height are important for management in intensive care units (ICUs). Unfortunately, weight beds or bed scales are not available in a significant number of ICUs and these variables are often estimated by health care personnel. The accuracy of such estimations is poorly described. OBJECTIVE. To investigate the accuracy of visual estimation of weight and height in critically ill patients. METHODS. Prospective study conducted in a 10-bed mixed medical and surgical ICU. Patients were consecutively weighed by an unblinded physician with a stretcher scale (T3 metric), and measured by a physical therapist using a measuring tape. The ideal weight was calculated using the ARDSnet's formulas for predicted body weight. Medical staff (MS), internal medicine resident (IMR), nursing staff (NS), physiotherapist (PT) and nutritionist (NU) were asked to estimate patient actual weight, ideal weight and height. They were blind to the estimations during all the protocol. Estimations in each healthcare group were computed as means, medians and percentage of error from actual and ideal weight and height, respectively. ANOVA test was used to compare mean estimations between the groups. There were no significant differences between the groups in estimation of either weight (p = 0.73) or height (p = 0.68).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "CONCLUSION.

In clinical setting biochemical signals based on which IAH is considered severe or detrimental on visceral tissues are scarce. Currently, the only clinically relevant signal is decreasing hourly diuresis. In an attempt to find an early sign of metabolically relevant signal on clinically marked IAH we investigated abdominal wall metabolite concentrations. Previously high lactate/pyruvate has been detected in dialysate from rectus abdominis muscle (RAM) in animal models of IAH [3] . In the present experiment we hypothesized that laparoscopic surgery which induces IAH could lead to clinically significant increase of L/P ratio as a signal of anaerobic metabolism caused by IAH and insufficient tissue perfusion. INTRODUCTION. Among the techniques proposed to assess microperfusion and oxygenation, NIRS sounds to be convenient [1] .

In this study, we evaluated SctO 2 monitoring after carotid surgery as possible continuous on-line monitoring of cerebral hyperperfusion. Fourteen pts scheduled for CEA were monitored for 12 h postoperatively after CEA. Bilateral SctO 2 monitoring was started before induction of anesthesia and maintained until 12 h postoperatively. Intra-operative EEG monitoring guided the decision to intraluminal shunt insertion. Strict blood pressure control was applied at maintaining normotensive levels throughout the clamping procedure. Early postoperative care focussed on strict maintenance of normotensive blood pressure. In no pt, any change in EEG was observed after carotid clamping. In all pts, ipsilateral SctO 2 significantly decreased after carotid clamping, without any SctO 2 value below 55%. We observed no changes in contralateral SctO 2 . Mean clamping time was 28 min (19-37 min). In all pts, clamp release restored ipsilateral SctO 2 to baseline values. In all pts, emergence from anesthesia was uneventful, without any new neurological deficit. In 6 of 14 pts, significant increases (SctO 2 [ 85%) in ipsilateral SctO 2 were observed in the postoperative period (m SctO 2 87.5%), without any changes in contralateral SctO 2 . This increase occurred at a mean of 3.4 h after carotid declamping with a mean duration 5.3 h. In these 14 pts, we could not make any significant correlation to arterial blood pressure, as none of these 6 pts needed more aggressive antihypertensive control. We noted that 4 of these 6 pts suffered from diabetes mellitus, while 5 of 6 pts revealed high ([90%) contralateral stenosis. Further data will have to reveal the importance of these comorbide factors. Non-invasive cerebral oximetry, enabling absolute cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring, could provide on-line estimation of cerebral perfusion state after CEA. This could allow bedside detection (and eventual therapeutic interventions) of cerebral hyperperfusion after CEA. INTRODUCTION. Analysis of microcirculatory alterations obtained by side-stream dark field (SDF) is time consuming. Automated analysis with modern softwares could accelerate this process and help to quantify blood flow velocity. However, perfusion detection is based on the contrast between pixels and this may be influenced by image settings. OBJECTIVE. We aimed to compare data obtained with a new software to the traditional semi-quantitative analysis of SDF images. METHODS. We selected from our database six images of poor sublingual microcirculatory perfusion and six images of good microcirculatory perfusion registered by the SDF technique (MicroScan; MicroVision Medical, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The proportion of perfused vessels [PPV = (number of vessels with continuous flow/number of all vessels) 9 100] \\ 70% was used to define microcirculatory perfusion. Total vessel density (TVD) was determined automatically by the software AVA 3.0 (MicroVision Medical) and also by the semi-quantitative technique, considered as the gold-standard (number of capillary crossing three equidistant vertical and horizontal lines divided by the total length of these lines). AVA Software was also used as default definitions or set to optimize analyses according to manufacturer instructions. Vessels falsely detected (false positive = FP) or missed (false negative = FN) by the software, in comparison to the semi-quantitative evaluation, were also counted. RESULTS. TVD was significantly higher by the AVA software either on default or on optimized mode than by the semi-quantitative method, and these differences were present with good or poor perfusion images (Table 1) . Overall FP rate was 22%, and it was greater in poor perfusion images (40%). Optimization of the AVA set parameters attenuated FP rates both in poor and good perfusion images, at the expense of increasing FN rates (Table) . Due to intrinsic characteristics of the software, the mean total grid length was significantly lower in the AVA than in the semi-quantitative analysis (3.8 vs. 5.6 INTRODUCTION. Perfusion index (PI) is the proportion of constant absorbed light compared to pulsatile absorbed light emitted from a pulse oxymeter. It ranges from a value below 1 up to 20 depedant of peripheral perfusion. It is measured primarily to evaluate the signal quality for the pulse oxymeter and is displayed by some pulse oxymeters to be acknowledged by the clinician. The PI changes with vasodilation and vasoconstriction. However, intubation is a stimulus able to increase endogenous catecholamines and thus leading to vasoconstriction possibly declining the perfusion index. Therefore we found intubation with a double lume tube in a thoracic surgery setting as a suitable setting to evaluate changes in perfusion index as a reaction to intubation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 4883, "end": 4895, "text": "(3.8 vs. 5.6", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4497, "end": 4506, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF8"}, {"start": 4722, "end": 4729, "text": "(Table)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "RESULTS."}, {"text": "After informed consent, we enrolled seven patients undergoing lung surgery requiring an double lume tube.

A baseline value was recorded prior to induction and compared to the value 3 minutes after induction. Then the PI measured next to intubation was compared to the PI after induction and analysed using Students t test. INTRODUCTION. Anticoagulation strategies for albumin dialysis suppose a difficult compromise between risk for bleeding and a high tendency to clot in the circuit. Even thought the sessions are short, a premature clotting is a serious event because the lost of blood (high priming volume) and a high cost of the systems.

Non-survivors show more severity at the beginning and during their ICU stay, more altered biological markers and a higher mean glycemia, but do not show significant difference either at initial glycemia, history of diabetes, hypoglycemia event or insulin treatment. Elevated mean glycemia appears to be a factor independently associated with higher mortality. Hyperglycemia prevalence in critically ill patients is very high and the controversy whether it is a mortality marker or a mediator still remains.

The calcium activated potassium channel (BKCA) exists in smooth muscle cells in most vascular beds and is believed to be important in sepsis induced hypotension and vascular hyporeactivity [1] and also in neutrophil killing and macrophage production of proinflamatory cytokines. However the latter two roles have been disputed [2] and we have found that BKCA expression is not upregulated in aorta from septic mice using real time polymerase chain reaction. As its role in sepsis remains uncertain we sought to determine whether null mice for the BKCA channel were (a) resistant to hypotension and (b) showed improved survival in a clinically relevant model of fecal peritonitis. METHODS. BKCA null mice (based on BALC) were obtained from JAX \u00d2 Mice. Agematched litter mates homozygous for BKCA were wild types (WT). Mice (age 18-24 weeks) had tethered arterial and venous lines inserted under isoflurane anesthesia. The tether enabled mice to roam cages freely whilst continuous blood pressure (BP) traces were obtained. 24 h post surgery, echocardiogram and intraperitoneal injection of rat slurry was administered under anesthesia. Fluid resuscitation of 0.3 ml/h voluven/5% dextrose (50:50) was given. At 6 and 24 h echo was recorded and mice culled with mesenteric arteries dissected for myography. Data expressed as mean(sem) and statistical analysis ANOVA. RESULTS. Genotypic study and whole cell patch clamp recording in aortic smooth muscle cells confirmed BKCA current was absent in null mice. Fecal peritonitis induced equivalent hypotension in both WT (n = 5) and BKCA null mice (n = 4) at 3-12 h (Fig. 1a ). Echocardiography at 6 h post slurry showed no difference in cardiac output between WT-23.1 (3.1) and BKCA null mice-23.4 (2.6) ml/min and no difference or improvement cf time 0 (Fig. 1b) . Thus this fall in BP is due to reduction in total peripheral resistance not myocardial depression.

During the initiation phase of experimental acute kidney injury (AKI), subtle but devastating changes, such as loss of brush borders, disruption of tubular cell polarity and cytoskeletal changes are detectable only to a certain extent by routine histologic methods.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is used as the first-line agent for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in 96% of ICUs in the UK (UK) [1] .

Treatment of acute pancreatitis is aimed at correcting any underlying predisposing factor and at the pancreatic inflammation itself. Hypertriglyceridemia is an uncommon cause of pancreatitis. A serum triglyceride level of more then 1,000 to 2,000 mg/ dL is an identifiable risk factor. Interestingly, serum pancreatic enzyme levels may be normal or only minimally elevated in such cases. Severe necrotizing pancreatitis is associated with a high rate of complications and significant mortality.

INTRODUCTION. The development of electrolyte disturbances in intensive care patients could be prevented by the use of better adapted dialysis fluids. A common problem is hypophosphatemia which has been shown to occur in up to 80% of the patients. Correction by intravenous phosphate supplementation is known to improve respiratory muscles, cardiac index, oxygen delivery to tissues and insulin resistance. Lately it has been reported that phosphate can be added directly to the dialysis fluid. This facilitates phosphate handling, but there is a risk of precipitation with calcium. An additional problem is that the amount of phosphate required to correct total body deficit varies and repeated serum measurements are needed to establish phosphate insufficiency.

Acute lung injury (ALI) is a clinical manifestation of respiratory failure caused by lung inflammation and the disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier. To prevent alveolar edema, it is of critical importance to preserve the physical integrity of the alveolar epithelial monolayer which is regulated by the balance between centripetal forces arising from cytoskeletal tension and cell-cell and cell-matrix tethering forces [1] . Intercellular junctions, such as tight junctions are closely related to actin cytoskeleton-related barrier regulation.

Alveolar oedema is a hallmark of ARDS and ALI. Fluid clearance and the influence of anaesthetics on oedema resolution are poorly understood on a molecular level in the injured lung.

INTRODUCTION. The migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) into the lung plays a critical role in the development of acute lung injury (ALI). Adenosine receptor A3 (A3AR) is one of four G protein-coupled adenosine receptors that has been demonstrated to modulate PMN trafficking in various models of inflammatory disorders including sepsis and asthma.

Paraffin-embedded sections of the lung were stained for PMNs after LPS inhalation to illustrate their accumulation in the lung.

Pharmacological activation of A3AR diminished the LPS-induced microvascular permeability in WT mice but not in A3KO mice.

CASE REPORT. A 35 years old men, fall from 20 meters high, while working in a truss. He was immobilized with semirigid cervical collar and backboard in the scene and transport to our trauma center, witch was a 1 h car-distance. Anesthesiologist Team was present since the initial management in Emergengy Room (ER) and act according to Advanced Trauma Life Support principles. In primary survey, patient was paraplegic, had a GCS of 14/15, a normal respiratory rate, a slight hypotension and a slight tachycardia. When Surgeon places a chest drainage, it drains immediately more than 1,500 ml blood, and the patient vital signs started to fade, to extreme bradicardia. The patient was then intubated with a rapid sequence intubation, with a single lumen endobronquial tube, and ventilated with protective lung ventilation. Hypotension postinduction was promptly treated with vasoactive drugs (nor-adrenaline and dobutamine) and ongoing volume resuscitation. An Emergency Resuscitative Mediam Sternotomy incision was perfomed in the ER and reveled a Clavicule and Sternum fracture and laceration in the Braquiocephalic artery which has repaired. Maintenance was performed with total intravenous anesthesia with fentanyl and nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. Monitoring include standard monitoring plus direct arterial and central venous pressures. During the surgical procedure we treat massive blood loss, with multiple transfusions of 17 units of red blood cells (unmatched type-specific), seven units fresh plasma, and 2 pools of plaquets, fibrinogen and cryoprecipitate. At the end of the surgery, still ongoing blood loses, made us suspect of coagulopathy, and to use Octaplex \u00d2 . It was also performed a nasal tamponade, to stop severe epistaxis and suture a major scalp wound with evidence of basal skull fracture. Patient was transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) ventilated.We was extubated at the 18th day post-operative. After 27 days, he still remains in ICU, because he is recovering from lumbar spine fixation for a total fracture-dislocation of D8-D9. DISCUSSION.

The use of Cell-Saver \u00d2 would have been beneficial, but it was unavailable in ER. We included only patients attended in this Unit by ICU personnel.

In EVLW we only find significantly differences in post hoc study between first measurements and fourth one (p 0.03), 5th (p 0.04), 6th (p 0.04), 7th (p 0.007), 8th (p 0.01) and 9th (p 0.04).In the EVLW/ITBV ratio (permeability Index = PI) we did not observe significantly changes in the evolution.The inhalation factor did not change CI outcomes neither magnitude nor in the measurements evolution (p 0.48 and p 0.71 respectively), the same form, ITBV (p 0.73 and p 0.28 respectively), but inhalation modified EVLW (p 0.04) and the Permeability Index was in the signification stadistic limit (p 0.06).Mortality was higher in patients who CI was lower and EVLW was in higher values. CONCLUSIONS. Thermodilution in the reanimation period in critically ill burn patient shows significantly haemodynamic changes in the evolution that can help to adapt the treatment.The inhalation syndrome only modified the measurements of EVLW significantly in this period but it influenced neither CI, ITBV nor PI.

Trauma systems are multifactorial modules that incorporate any aspect of traumatic injury from the very moment of the injury to the final outcome. A significant prerequisite for the development of a trauma system is the trauma registry. Trauma registries are the actual core of any trauma system since they provide valuable information about the standard of care offered to the patients and are amenable to quality control and statistical evaluations, which in turn allow improvements and amendments in the definite care.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALTA) is a rare but severe complication (0.08/1,000 patients/year) of metformin treatment in type-II diabetes.

In univariate analyses, survival to discharge was significantly lower with two of 11 acute conditions (acute coronary syndrome and acute inflammation), and with five of 10 chronic conditions (chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, kidney failure, hepatic cirrhosis and malignancy). Recent surgery was strongly associated with higher odds of survival. The most consistent multivariate predictors of survival to discharge were liver cirrhosis (OR 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.70) and malignancy (OR 0.40; 0.25-0.63). Malignancy was not predictive for outcome after CPR attempts, whereas liver cirrhosis was predictive both in all dispatches and in dispatches involving CPR. Recent surgery was strongly associated with higher multivariate odds of survival (OR 6.1; 2.2-16.4) after cardiac arrest. In dispatches without CPR, absence of chronic conditions was associated with higher likelihood of survival (HR 6.9; 95% CI 5.2-9.3). Increasing numbers of chronic conditions were significantly and continuously associated with lower survival (p for trend \\ 0.0001). Advanced age only weakly predicted survival, but age C75 years was, along with malignancy, the strongest predictor of not attempting CPR in patients with cardiac arrest. CONCLUSIONS. Comorbidities are important determinants of survival after in-hospital MET dispatches, with and without cardiac arrest. Survival odds are lowest with malignancy and liver cirrhosis. Recent surgery increases odds of survival by exclusion of those most severely ill. Advanced age at best weakly predicts worse survival, but strongly predicts not attempting CPR. DESIGN.

In the UK, more than 300,000 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are transfused every year. Since 2004 there has been a reduction of 16% in its use, but it has been suggested that as many as 47% of transfusions in critical care may be inappropriate. There is significant morbidity associated with the transfusion of FFP. Guidelines for the use of FFP do exist, but the indications for its use are limited. Coagulation studies, such as prothrombin time (PT), abnormalities are often assumed to be a risk factor for bleeding prior to invasive procedures, but evidence suggests that FFP may not have a prophylactic role.

Little data exists on the demographics of MT and subsequent demand on a hospital's blood bank. We examined the MT requirements of a 1071 bedded tertiary referral hospital over a 20 month period. OBJECTIVES. To establish the MT demographic, speciality distribution, PRBC demand and associated mortality; within a tertiary referral hospital over a 20 month period. To assist with future MT logistics, planning, implementation and audit. METHODS. The hospital blood bank database was reviewed for cases of MT from Jan 2007 to Aug 2008. Inclusion criteria were the administration of C 10 units of (PRBC) within a 24 h period. Cross referencing with the laboratory records and medical notes was undertaken to establish patient demographics, hospital specialty, diagnosis, outcome and number of PRBC transfused. RESULTS. 59 patients received MT over a 20-month period; 34 male (57.6%) 25 female (42.3%). Median age 71 years (range 16-95). Median MT of PRBC was 12 (range 10-50) units. 881 units of PRBC were transfused in the treatment of MT during the study period, accounting for a hospital expenditure of over \u20ac175,000. The main specialties associated with MT were the: Emergency Department (17 patients, 28.8%), Cardiothoracic Surgery (13 patients, 22.0%), and 11 General Surgery (11 patients, 18.6%). 25 of the 59 patients receiving massive transfusions (42.3%), did not survive to hospital discharge. 56% of those patients who died, did so in the first 48 h with a further 4% dying in the next 24 h. 20% of the further deaths occurred within and 20% after thirty days. CONCLUSIONS. MT in our establishment is associated with a high mortality and predominantly early deaths. Recipients were generally elderly with significant co-morbidity. Provision of PRBCs and blood components for Massive Transfusion recipients, is challenging for blood bank services [2] . The demand of MT, within our establishment, was predominantly within the acute specialties; emphasizing the need for close communication between them and the laboratory services. In light of this data we propose the implementation of a MT protocol together with continuous audit, to assess its effect on outcome.

INTRODUCTION. Blood transfusion therapy (BTT) is thought as one of transplantation of living cell, that means BTT includes several risk such as infection and BTT should be thought to derived from precious material by courtesy of donors. Patients with traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival on the hospital (T-CPA) usually suffered from lethal hemorrhage and required rapid supplement of red blood cells for resuscitation of circulation and oxygen transport, that is to say BTT.

Benson 2 1 Belfast City Hospital, Intensive Care, Belfast, UK, 2 Belfast City Hospital, Department of Haematology, Belfast, UK We report a case of life-threatening haemorrhage occurring as a result of a rare acquired condition caused by the production of an antibody to clotting Factor VIII. This necessitated administration of recombinant activated Factor VIIa (Novoseven) to bypass this step of the clotting cascade. A 71-year-old man presented to intensive care following OGD for acute upper gastro-intestinal haemorrhage, with recent haemoptysis and haematuria. OGD had demonstrated a large clot obstructing the oesophagus and extending through stomach into duodenum. This could not be removed and no bleeding points were identified. A coagulopathy was detected which failed to correct with administration of appropriate amounts of fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC), necessitating clotting factor studies. This demonstrated a Factor VIII level of 2% with a detectable antibody inhibitor. Acquired haemophilia was diagnosed and activated Factor VIIa was administered resulting in rapid correction of coagulation studies and arrest of haemorrhage. It was necessary to continue daily Activated Factor VIIa at a dose of 40 mg a day in addition to anti-inhibitor coagulant complex (FEIBA-VH)-an activated prothrombin complex with Factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity. Definitive treatment of the coagulopathy was chemotherapy with Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine and Rituximab. This destroyed the Factor VIII inhibitor and returned his Factor VIII levels to almost 100%. Laparotomy and gastrotomy were required to relieve the oesophageal obstruction from the accumulated clot. He was eventually discharged from hospital and remains well. Acquired haemophilia is a rare haematological condition that presents with refractory haemorrhage and coagulopathy and these patients are likely to be referred to critical care services for ongoing support and management. It has an incidence of approximately 1.5 cases per million per year [1] . Underlying medical conditions can be identified in up to 50% of patients and include autoimmune disease, solid tumours, lymphoproliferative malignancies and pregnancy [2] . International recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with this condition have recently been published and advise recombinant activated Factor VIIa to control bleeding followed by a combination of corticosteroid and chemotherapy [2] .

The plant is Lawsonia Alba and the powdered leaves are used to apply decorative designs over the skin. Henna application is widely practiced in the Arab and Asian communities. They create fascinating designs over the skin, especially over the hands and feet. It is widely practiced during wedding ceremonies and at childbirth. G6PD deficiency is common in the community of the Arab world. Lawsone, the chemical compound in the Henna leaves, is capable of inducing severe acute hemolysis in G6PD deficient cases. The compound is chemically related to Naphtha. We report a case of acute sever hemolysis in a young girl who presented with dizziness and jaundice and diagnosed to have acute severe hemolysis. Her symptoms had started while preparing for her wedding by henna application. The girl was G6PD deficient, and found to have severe hemolysis resulting from Henna application on her skin. Very few cases have been reported of similar nature. The matter is also of tremendous practical implication in areas of G6PD deficiency. The relevant literature is reviewed as well. BACKGROUND. Lactate has prognostic use in critically ill medical and trauma patients, and is a core component in identification of early sepsis. Elevated lactate levels in these patients prior to ICU admission, e.g. in an A&E setting or pre hospital setting identify patients at risk of death and can trigger an earlier optimization of triage decisions and earlier targeted treatment. A range of POC methodologies for lactate measurement are available but there is little standardization between methodologies. Stat Sensor Lactate is a new POC Lactate meter based on a patented multiwell and multilayer electrochemical technology that incorporates control wells that measure and correct for common interfering substances. The electrochemistry technology is layered onto a gold platform providing a stable and robust surface for the electrochemical reaction kinetics.

INTRODUCTION. Low-grade systemic inflammation has been shown to play a key role in the pathophysiology of several chronic noncommunicable diseases [1, 2] and may be attenuated by anti-inflammatory treatments such as administration of statins [3] . So far, the association between acute systemic inflammation experienced during critical illness and long-term mortality after hospital discharge has not been investigated in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. OBJECTIVES. To assess the association between acute systemic inflammation, assessed by CRP levels, and post-hospital mortality in non-surgical ICU patients. METHODS. The study was performed as a prospective, observational follow-up study and included non-surgical critically ill patients with an ICU length of stay [24 h. Patients who died during the ICU or hospital stay, were \\18 years or pregnant, as well as patients discharged from the hospital with the plan to limit life support were excluded. Demographics, chronic diseases, admission diagnosis, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, length of ICU stay, maximum CRP levels during the ICU stay (CRPmax) and CRP levels at ICU discharge (CRPdis) were documented. After a mean \u00b1 SD follow-up time of 2.04 \u00b1 1.08 years, mortality and causes of death were determined. Adjusted Cox models were calculated to investigate the association of CRPmax and CRPdis with post-hospital mortality. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to identify optimal cut-off levels to predict post-hospital mortality. BACKGROUND.

As the specialty of critical care is expanding in developing countries it is utmost essential to educate the importance of communicating detailed patient information on the referral note. It helps to maintain continuity of care, resource utilization, prevents delay in institution of life saving therapies and in early prognostication.INTRODUCTION. Emergency medical response team (EMRT) services were introduced to City Hospital, Birmingham to promote the early detection of clinical deterioration. In 2007, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) published guidelines for the documentation and reporting of medical emergency team reviews. A standardized approach to reporting medical emergency team events would enable quality improvement practices. OBJECTIVES. The purpose of this audit was to examine the quality of documentation of the events of EMRT calls and propose changes to improve the service. METHODS. The Hospital. This audit was conducted at City Hospital, Birmingham UK a district general hospital with 800 beds. Audit design. This prospective audit was conducted over a two-month period from 1st October to 30th November 2008. Data on all EMRT calls recorded in the ICU logbook was collected during the two-month period. A proforma based on the published ILCOR guidelines was formulated. The adequacy of documentation of EMRT events was assessed. This included the date and time of the call, the staff member making the call, details of the medical staff attending the call, the reason for the call, the preevent diagnoses and co-morbidities, the pre-event treatment, the physiological and clinical status of the patient, the differential diagnoses and interventions provided by the ERMT, and the planned further management of patients. Outcome measures and data analysis. The primary outcome measure of the audit was the adequacy of documentation of the EMRT event in relation to guidelines published by ILCOR. The audit demonstrated that many aspects of EMRT calls were not documented adequately. The lack of adequate documentation is a recognized limitation for quality improvement practices and research. The improvement of resuscitation practice and guidelines has been aided by the uniform reporting of cardiac arrest data. Standardizing the documentation of elements of EMRT calls would allow consistency in the reporting of findings at EMRT calls. To improve the quality of documentation of EMRT reviews proforma documents have been used at other institutions. We propose the use of a proforma based on the ILCOR guidelines, at future EMRT calls. We hope that by implementing this proforma, detailed analysis can be conducted to enhance the service and improve patient outcome.HOW CAN WE GET NEW INTENSIVISTS?-WEB SITE INFORMATION OF THE ICUS OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS IN JAPAN K.

Although some universities have several hospitals, only main hospitals of them are checked. If the site or mention of ICU cannot be found, the web site of the university is also checked. RESULTS. All of 80 university hospitals have any type of ICU. Seventeen university hospitals don't express the existence of ICU in the list of departments. Among them, at least five ICUs are mentioned to some extent in the independent sites of the Department of Anesthesiology. Among 63 ICUs which are listed on the homepages of the university hospitals, only two don't have any ICU information of them own on their web site. There are 16 closed ICUs and 23 ICUs as a part of emergency department belonging to university hospitals in Japan. Among 16 closed ICUs, only five are picked up by search engines such as Yahoo and Google. Compared to open ICUs, closed ICUs have a tendency to have more precisely and promotional homepages. Four sites of closed ICUs show the hit numbers and there is a tendency that the more pages it has, the more hit numbers it has. In 16 sites of ICU recruiting of members and young fellows is announced mainly on the top page. The number of sites including the part of research & publication, and training programs is 10 and 18 respectively. Only three sites have English version pages.CONCLUSIONS. The ICUs of 80 university hospitals have a variety of style and according to the style, the styles of web sites of them are also various. A Substantial web site is advisable for recruitment of members and fellows.A PRACTICAL APPROACH FOR TEACHING CRITICAL CARE ETHICS TO TRAINEE STAFF: A MEDICAL STUDENT EXPERIENCE OF USING AN ETHICAL CHECKLIST S.

Recent conflicting reports have been published on the possible role of vesical tonometry as a substitute for gastric intramucosal tonometry. The aim of our study was to detect the correlation between these methods in an animal model of endotoxic shock. The calculation of D vesical-systemic CO 2 did not improve the results. CONCLUSIONS. In our experience vesical tonometry does not correlate to haemodynamic parameters and does not substitute gastric tonometry for detection of hipoperfusi\u00f3n states. FUNDING.

The abdominal cavity can be considered as a semiclosed compartment, so any changes in its content may affect the intraabdominal pressure (IAP).

Two studies (n = 662 patients) reported on AKI defined by a doubling of serum creatinine or treatment with renal replacement therapy, eight studies (n = 694 patients) reported on changes of serum creatinine, two studies (n = 82) reported on changes in serum urea, and sixteen studies (n = 1,005) reported on urine output. Except for AKI, kidney function variables were only reported within a 24 h time period after administration of HES or control solutions. There was considerable statistical and clinical heterogeneity between studies. All three kidney outcome variables remained unchanged after administration of HES [creatinine: mean difference = -2.68 lmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -8.33, 2.98; serum urea: mean difference = -0.16 lmol/L, 95% CI = -0.85, 0.53; and urine output: mean difference = 49.29 mL/24 h, 95% CI = -99.29, 197.87]. The effects of HES on these kidney outcome variables was comparable in patients who were administered HES 130 versus HES 200 solutions. Risk for AKI was only assessed with HES 200 solutions.

OBJECTIVES. To describe the causes and prognosis of severe PR-ARF episodes. PATIENTS AND METHODS. We conducted, in 2 medico-surgical ICUs in France, a retrospective study of patients admitted for PR-ARF from 1995 to 2008. Post-obstructive diuresis (POD) was defined as polyuria[2 ml/(kg h) lasting for[3 h without diuretic. Patients with or without (1) POD (2) estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by Cockroft and Gault formulation \\30 ml/min at the end of follow-up were compared by univariate analysis using nonparametric tests. Data are shown as median (extremes) or percentage.Symptoms duration, kidney pelvis diameter, uremia on admission, urinary urea or sodium concentrations after derivation were not significantly associated with POD occurrence. Acute hemodialysis, vasopressors and mechanical ventilation were required in 43, 21, and 20% of cases respectively. Follow-up duration was 197 (15-2,200) days. Survival rates after 1, 3 and 6 months were 84, 76, and 69%. At the end of follow-up, 28% of patients had estimated GFR \\ 30 ml/min and 6% required chronic hemodialysis. Risk factors of GFR \\ 30 ml/min by univariate analysis are:Age, treatment by ACE inhibitors, symptoms duration, kidney size, kidney pelvis diameter, creatininemia on admission, urinary infection, and occurrence of POD as defined, were not significantly associated with estimated GFR \\ 30 ml/min at the end of follow-up. Due to missing data, multivariate analysis was not performed. CONCLUSIONS. Severe PR-ARF is a significant cause of mortality and chronic renal failure, but risk of dialysis dependency is low at middle term. Risk factors of POD and chronic renal failure are related with previous renal failure. Diuresis on day 1 is correlated with renal prognosis. GRANT.

Several studies have validated RIFLE criteria in intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital patients. However, no data on RIFLE criteria is available on patients receiving Medical Emergency Team (MET) review.METHODS. Retrospective observational study in a single tertiary care Australian hospital. Information on patient demographics and MET review details were obtained from the prospective electronic record of MET activity and laboratory data from the electronic hospital database. When a baseline creatinine value for the 6 month before hospital admission was not available, this was calculated according to MDRD formula. Data are given as mean (or median) \u00b1 standard deviation (or interquartile range) for continuous variables, as percentage for categorical variables. Kaplan-Meier curve was constructed setting day 30 mortality as dependent variable. RESULTS. We analyzed 2231 MET calls activated in 1,662 patients over a two-year period.TABLE 1 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND OUTCOME CHARACTERISTICS Table 1 summarizes our major epidemiological findings and creatinine values for the entire population and after correction for not for resuscitation (NFR) order.

To describe the characteristics and prognostic factors of patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in an intensive care unit (ICU).DESIGN. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected simple data over 6 consecutive years. Setting. Polyvalent ICU of the Insular University Hospital in Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain. Patients: Adult patients admitted in ICU who receiving CRRT. Primary variables of interest. Demographic data, clinical diagnosis on ICU admission, Apache II, days of stay in ICU, days of mechanical ventilation and CRRT. Hospitalary mortality and at one year later was collected.RESULTS. During the study period, 3,786 patients were admitted to the ICU. Of these 182 (4.8%) received CRRT, during an average of 9.1 \u00b1 5.1 days, with a mortality in ICU of 43.4%. In the moment of the discharge of the ICU 12 patients continued needing dialysis but only 1 did not receive it previously to its admission. 12 (11.6%) of the surviving patients in the ICU, died in plant and 73 (70.8%) were still alive one year later. When we compare them with the patients who did not needed CRRT, they had a major stay in ICU (p 0.02), major need of mechanical ventilation (p \\ 0.001) and a significantly major mortality(43.4 vs.  18.3%, p \\ 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed as independent variables associated with the mortality, the mean of days at ICU, the days of mechanical ventilation and the Apache II (p \\ 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS. Critically ill patients who require CRRT have high in-hospital mortality though the survival at one year was high. The majority of patients are independent of dialysis at the time of hospital discharge.KEYWORDS. Renal replacement therapy, Intensive care units, Prognosis, Mortality.

Patients in both groups were comparable with respect to demographic parameters and had comparable APACHE scores. Nevertheless, norepinephrine dose was higher (median 0.38 mcg/(kg min), while pH was lower (median 7.24) in the HV-CVVH group when compared to LV-CVVH (0.22 and 7.36, respectively; both p \\ 0.001). Interestingly, although MAP was not significantly different between both groups at the start of CVVH, MAP rose in the first 6 h using HV-CVVH (median 66 to 73 mm Hg; p = 0.016), while no change occurred in the LV-CVVH group. In addition, norepinephrine dose was significantly lower after 6 h of HV-CVVH [median decrease 0.08 mcg/(kg min)], whereas no change had occurred in the LV-CVVH group (p \\ 0.001).CONCLUSIONS. This retrospective study demonstrates that HV-CVVH is feasible and safe. HV-CVVH is associated with an improvement in MAP and decrease in vasopressor requirements in the first 6 h. A prospective study should demonstrate whether HV-CVVH is superior in comparison to LV-CVVH with respect to stabilization of shock irrespective of disease severity.ROLE OF COAGULATION, ANTICOAGULATION AND SEVERITY OF ORGAN FAILURE IN CIRCUIT CLOTTING DURING CONTINUOUS VENOVENOUS HEMOFILTRATION (CVVH) C.

To determine the characteristics of critical care patients submitted to continuous replacement renal therapeutics and analyse if the decrease of the prescribed dose can influence the outcome.METHODS. Prospective observational cohort of ICU patients requiring CRRT at tree ICU of two Hospitalar Centers from Portugal between 2007 and 2008. We enrolled patients submitted to continuous different modes such as continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) and continuous high volume hemofiltration (HVHF). Prescribed dose was calculated by de sum of the pre and pos replacement plus dialysis fluid. The difference between the prescribed and the effective supplied dose (calculated by the machine) was the loss of dose. Predictors evaluated were age, gender, SAPSII, SOFA, LOS, the time to begin CRRT, prescribed dose and effective dose. The main outcome was mortality at 28 days. Independent T test was used to asses the association of continuous variables and Ttime to asses the association of dose loss and mortality.RESULTS. Ninety-two patients met the inclusion criteria. Overall mortality for the study was 74%. The study included 4.824 h of renal treatment and 288 daily data samples. Mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 15.1 years and 45.1% were women. The mean weight was 74.3 \u00b1 15.1 (median 70.3) kg and SAPS II 53.3 \u00b1 19.3. The time to beginning the technique was 1.9 \u00b1 2.8 days. The prescribed dose was 3133.8 \u00b1 760.2 ml/h [44.1 \u00b1 12.8 ml/(kg h)] compared with the real and effective dose of 3090.6 \u00b1 896.9 ml/h [42.8 \u00b1 10.8 ml/(kg h)] (p 0.0001 and 0.005).

High permeability membranes are poorly adapted for dialysis, with a limit in 25-30 mL/min rates. AN69 shows the lower diffusive capability. Our aim was to determine wether a higher dose of dialysis could be applied efficiently with AN69. METHODS. 43 measures on eleven patients treated with hemodialfiltration [Prismaflex \u00d2 monitors, AN69 1.4 m 2 membrane, bicarbonate fluids]. Before sampling we registered anticoagulation, convective and diffusive dose, blood flow (Qb), transmembrane pressure (TMP), and hours of filter running and left the monitor with only dialysis (50 mL/min) and zero extraction and convection for 15 min. Then took a sample of blood (inlet and outlet) and effluent to measure urea (SatUr), creatinine (SatCr) and \u00df 2 -microglobulin (SatB 2 ) and immediately the prescribed treatment was restarted. Saturation (Sat) was measured as = [effluent level]/[(level in ? level out)/2]. For statistical analysis we drew dispersion graphs and r 2 . U-Mann Whitney was used for bivariate analysis. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SD (range).When looking for differences between more recent (n = 31) or older (n = 12) filters ([24 h) we found differences in SatB 2 (p 0.06) but not for SatCr or SatUr (p ns). CONCLUSIONS. With AN69, small molecules are cleared efficiently with up to 50 mL/min dialysis, but middle molecules are eliminated poorly and for a short time. Creatinine does not seem adequate as saturation marker.BICARBONATE BASED REPLACEMENT FLUID ACHIEVES BETTER ACID-BASE HOMEOSTASIS THAN LACTATE BASED FLUID DURING CONTINUOUS VENOVENOUS HAEMOFILTRATION (CVVHF) FOR ACUTE RENAL FAILURE IN SEPTIC PATIENTS ADMITTED TO INTENSIVE CARE R. Saha 1 , F. Kovari 1 , A. Davenport 2 , S. Shaw 1 , B. Agarwal 1 1 Royal Free Hospital, Critical Care Unit, London, UK, 2 Royal Free Hospital, Department of Nephrology, London, UK INTRODUCTION. Treatment aims of CVVHF include solute clearance and correction of metabolic acidosis. CVVHF, unlike haemodialysis, results in net loss of bicarbonate and therefore requires buffer in the replacement fluid in the form of acetate, lactate or bicarbonate. CVVHF with lactate buffered replacement fluids may induce iatrogenic hyperlactataemia thus causing an acidifying effect and therefore a less effective acid-base balance [1]. Our study aims to identify if bicarbonate based replacement fluid achieves better acid-base homeostasis than lactate based fluid during continuous venovenous haemofiltration. METHODS. 40 consecutive septic patients admitted to our intensive care unit from December 2008 onwards who developed renal failure requiring CVVHF for [48 h are being enrolled for this prospective observational study. Data collected includes demographics, admitting diagnosis and CVVHF prescription (dose, duration and choice of replacement fluid; lactate based Monosol or bicarbonate based Accusol). Electrolytes (sodium {Na ? }, potassium {K ? }, chloride {Cl -} and phosphate {PO 4-}), lactate and hydrogen [H ?] concentrations in serum at 0, 24 and 48 h and in the ultrafiltrate at 24 h were measured. Data collected also includes the overall fluid intake (volume and type of fluids) and output volumes (ultrafiltrate, urine and other losses such as vomiting, diarrhoea and drain fluids). RESULTS. Currently 28 patients have been enrolled and data was analysed on an intention to treat basis, p \\ 0.05 taken as statistically significant. Monosol and Accusol groups comprised 17 and 11 patients respectively. 7 out of 17 in the Monosol group who either had additional intravenous bicarbonate infusion or were switched to Accusol were excluded. Demographic characteristics were similar in both groups as were the serum Na ? , K ? and Clat 48 h. Serum lactate at 48 h were similar in both groups (2.2 \u00b1 0.2 in Monosol and 2.2 \u00b1 0.3 mmol/l in Accusol) but the Accusol group had higher baseline lactate levels (4.6 \u00b1 1.3 vs. 3.0 \u00b1 0.8 mmol/l). Base excess (BE) at 48 h significantly improved in the Accusol group 5.2 \u00b1 2.1 compared to the Monosol group 0.64 \u00b1 0.6 mEq/L (p \\ 0.05). CONCLUSION. In our study bicarbonate buffered replacement fluids provides greater control of metabolic acidosis than lactate containing fluids in septic patients treated with CVVHF. Our study does not show hyperlactataemia to be a significant problem with lactate based fluids, contrary to previous reports[1]. REFERENCE(S). 1.

We tested a new dialysis solution with 1.2 mM phosphate, and compared it with standard medical treatment (Hemosol B0) in order to evaluate if we could maintain serum phosphate stability throughout the CRRT period. Patients were divided into three groups; group 1 (n = 14) receiving standard medical treatment and intravenous phosphate supplementation as required, group 2 (n = 14) receiving the phosphate-containing solution as both dialysate and replacement solutions, and group 3 (n = 14) receiving the phosphate solution as dialysate solution and Hemosol B0 as replacement solution.RESULTS. Standard medical treatment resulted in hypophosphatemia in 79% of the patients in group 1. Patients in group 2 and 3 experienced stable serum phosphate levels throughout the study. However, the simultaneous intake of nutritional phosphate resulted in a slight increase in serum phosphate in group 2, while 35% in group 3 experienced one episode of hypophosphatemia. Ionized calcium, potassium, magnesium, pH, pCO 2 and bicarbonate remained unchanged throughout the study.CONCLUSIONS.The new phosphate-containing solution for dialysis is safe, reduces the variability of serum phosphate levels during CRRT and reduces the incidence of hypophospatemia.HIGH FLOW CRRT AND THE IMPACT ON BLOOD GASESP.

Sepsis is a most complex and serious systemic response to infection and is one of the leading causes for morbidity and mortality in the critical care setting. In this research, a porcine model of induced endotoxic shock without hemofiltration is analyzed and the parameters of a previously validated cardiovascular system (CVS) model are identified. In this case no left ventricle signals were measured, so the identification process is applied to strictly right ventricle signals. This concept is of particular clinical importance, as often only limited data, such as data from only one of the ventricles (usually the left), is available in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF175": {"text": "). 1.

Meregali 2 1 UFCSPA, Internal Medicine, Porto Alegre, Brazil, 2 Complexo Hospitalar Santa Casa, Unidade de Tratamento Intensivo Central, Porto Alegre, Brazil OBJECTIVE. The venous-arterial carbon dioxide difference has been shown to increase when there is a decrease in cardiac output and/or a decrease in tissue perfusion. This study aims to evaluate the central venous-arterial carbon dioxide difference (Delta CO 2 ) as a global index of tissue perfusion. DESIGN. Prospective observational study. SETTING. A 18-bed university hospital medico-surgical ICU. PATIENTS. 27 critically ill patients in shock requiring noradrenaline to maintain PAM C 65 mmHg for at least 6 hs. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS. Hemodynamic measurements, arterial lactate, simultaneous arterial and central venous blood gases were obtained immediately after shock was identified (T0) and after 6 (T6), 12 (T12), 18 (T18) and 24 (T24) hours. Delta CO 2 was higher in nonsurvivors (NS) than in survivors during the first 18 h [T6 7 (3-9) vs. 3 (2-6), p = 0.049]. Delta CO 2 was significantly correlated (spearman correlation coefficient r = -0.36, p \\ 0.0001) with Central venous oxygen saturation (SatcvO 2 ). At any time, whenever the Delta CO 2 was high ([6 mmHg) the SatcvO 2 was lower in comparison with a low Delta CO 2 (T0, T6, T18; p \\ 0.005). Delta CO 2 was significantly correlated with arterial lactate (r = 0.52, p = 0.005) and with delta lactate (r = 0.53, p \\ 0.005) at T18. CONCLUSION. These preliminary results suggest that Delta CO 2 may sign global tissue underperfusion in shock patients. REFERENCE(S). 1.

Teboul 1 1 Hopital De Bic\u00eatre, R\u00e9animation M\u00e9dicale, Le Kremlin Bicetre, FranceINTRODUCTION.A recently commercialised near infrared spectrometry (NIRS) device provides the continuous measurement of the haemoglobin saturation in the terminal vascularisation within tissues (StO 2 ) of thenar eminence. Changes in StO 2 can be monitored during a vascular occlusion test (VOT) aimed at detecting microcirculatory disturbances. The VOT consists of performing a transient occlusion of the upstream arterial circulation (ischemic phase) and then a release of the arterial occlusion (hyperaemic phase). The StO 2 recovery slope has been shown to be a better prognostic factor than the baseline StO 2 in septic shock. However, there is no consensual way to perform the VOT in terms of location of the cuff (arm or forearm) and of duration of the arterial occlusion. Standardisation of the technique is needed. In this study we compared the data provided by four VOTs used in the literature in the aim to determine the more relevant VOT. METHODS. We enrolled healthy volunteers and septic shock patients. In each subject, we performed four different VOts in a random order using the InSpectra StO 2 650 monitor (Hutchinson, MN). The cuff was inflated to 220 mmHg. Arm (A) or forearm (FA) occlusion was maintained until StO 2 decreased to 40% (VOT A40% and VOT FA40% ) or lasted 3 min (VOT A3min and VOT FA3min ). The recovery slope was calculated off-line by InSpectra Analysis Program V4.00. RESULTS. We included 14 healthy volunteers (27 \u00b1 4 years) with a baseline StO 2 of 81 \u00b1 4% and 18 septic shock patients (61 \u00b1 14 years) with a baseline StO 2 of 79 \u00b1 10%. In septic shock patients, SAPS 2 was 58 \u00b1 16, mean arterial pressure was 76 \u00b1 13 mmHg (94% received norepinephrine) and mortality was 50%.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF178": {"text": "THENAR OXYGEN SATURATION (STO 2 ) AND INVASIVE OXYGEN DELIVERY MEASUREMENTS IN PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR INSUFFICIENCY.

Several studies have demonstrated that tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2 ) correlates with either mixed or central venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2 and ScvO 2 , respectively).

Unfortunately, this technique appears to be poorly sensitive, and normal StO 2 values cannot rule out low ScvO 2 . We hypothesized that StO 2 could be a reflection of DO 2 , where low StO 2 is always due to low DO 2 , and high StO 2 reflects normal or high DO 2 , although it could be inadequate to meet the global requirements (reflected by low ScvO 2 ).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF179": {"text": "Hb hemoglobin, CaO 2 arterial oxygen content, CvO 2 venous oxygen content, O2ER oxygen extraction ratio, CI, cardiac index", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF180": {"text": "Biomarkers: 0305-0318 PROCALCITONIN AND % BAND FORMS: INDICATORS OF NOSOCOMIAL SEPSIS IN PATIENTS WITH SIRS P.

Retrospective study in patients (pts) who received mechanical ventilation (MV) [ 24 h between December 2006 and December 2007. Early VAP was clinically suspected in those pts who received MV \\7 days. Resistant bacteria (RB) were defined as the presence of: pseudomonas spp, Stenotrophomonas spp, Acinetobacter spp, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and resistants Enterobacterias. Clinical and demographic variables were collected including comorbidities, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), previous use of antibiotics (ATB) and whether empiric treatment was appropriate.Continuous variables are expressed as medians (25-75th percentile). Fisher's exact test or Mann Whitney test were used as appropriate.RESULTS. 240 pts received MV for [24 h during the study period. Early VAP was suspected in 107 and microbiologically confirmed in 58 pts. RB were isolated in 35 pts (60% of early VAP). The most common RB were pseudomonas (11 pts) and Acinetobacter (13 pts). Clinical variables in pts with early VAP caused by RB and sensible bacteria (SB) are displayed inTable.CLINICAL VARIABLES IN PTS WITH EARLY VAP SB VAP (n = 23) RB VAP (n = 35) P Comorbidities included severe COPD, cirrhosis, cancer under chemotherapy, chronic use of steroids, chronic hemodyalisis", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF193": {"text": "). 1.

Between 1 January and 31 March of 2009, 149 patients were admitted to the ICU. 49 patients presented with sepsis on admission or during their stay. The most common infection site was the lung (83.7%) followed by primary bacteraemia (4.1%). Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were isolated in the following proportion: 30.6 and 22.4%, respectively. Enterobacter, Acinetobacter and Escherichia were the most frequently isolated (6.1% each). Gram-positive sepsis was mainly caused by Haemophylus influenzae (12.2%). Sepsis was polimicrobial in 6.1% of cases. 24.5% of the patients were given inappropriate antibiotics. The proportion of Gram-negative bacteria isolated was significantly higher in patients who did not receive appropriate antibiotics. The magnitude of the PCT and CRP elevation was not associated with the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy. Logistical regression analysis showed that infection without agent was an independent predictor of inappropriateness of antibiotic therapy.Age, SAPS II, APACHE II and SOFA were not associated with an unsuccessful treatment. Regarding the absolute value of CRP and PCT there was no significant difference between successful or unsuccessful. Multivariate analysis showed that DPCT 3 was not associated with antibiotic appropriateness and mortality.CONCLUSIONS.

Twenty patients (38%) had previously received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Thirty patients (57%) presented neutropenia at the moment of ICU admission. The main causes for ICU admission were respiratory failure in 23 patients (43%) and septic shock in 17 (32%). PCT levels were not significantly higher in those patients that required mechanical ventilation. PCT levels were significantly higher (p = 0,023) in those patients admitted because of septic shock. PCT levels were lower in days 1, 2 and 3 in the patients who survived with respect to those who died: day 1: 12.67 ng/ml (SD 28.89) versus 18.54 (SD 23); day 2: 8.40 (SD 18.91) versus 19.43 (SD 22.78) ; day 3: 4.50 (SD 9.86) versus 17.22 (SD 25.72 ).

Serum PCT levels are higher in patients with septic shock. Serum PCT measurement might be useful for predicting mortality in patients with hematological malignancy who require advanced life support. INTRODUCTION. Sepsis is a major cause of mortality in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Efforts have been made to reduce the time needed to diagnose sepsis in order to reduce mortality from sepsis-related multiple organ dysfunction. Procalcitonin (PCT) has been reported elevated levels at the onset of bacterial infections and seemingly correlated to severity of infection. Several clinical trials have detected a high PCT level in patients with evidence of systemic bacterial infections, whereas relatively low PCT levels occur in patients with only localized bacterial infections.OBJECTIVE. The aim of the present study was to assessed the ability of PCT through sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) in patients with suspected sepsis, septic shock, inflammatory systemic response syndrome (SIRS) and compared it with variables like CRP, mortality, band%, renal failure, active cancer and an isolated bacterial cultures.

During a twelve years and a half period, from 1996 to 2008, 413 ICU-patients with clinically significant bacteremia were prospectively evaluated. For purposes of this investigation, appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment of a bloodstream infection (AEAT) was defined as the microbiological documentation of infection that was effectively treated based on its antibiotic susceptibility at the time the causative microorganism were suspected.

It is not clear whether patients with Community Acquired Severe Sepsis (CASS) or Hospital Acquired Severe Sepsis (HASS) have a same presentation. OBJECTIVES. to evaluate the characteristics of a severe sepsis (SS) population admitted through the ER (CASS) and those coming from the ward (HASS). All patients were treated by the same team of intensivists and ER doctors in a shock room, so we could minimise the differences due to management. METHODS. All adult patients admitted to the medical ICU were eligible if they met the criteria for SS. We collected demographic characteristics, APACHE II and SOFA score, comorbidities and immuno-compromised conditions. ScvO 2 or SvO 2 (if possible), lactate concentrations. The milestones of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) were measured regularly during the first 6 h of treatment. The data collection went on in the ICU stay too. Treatment for septic shock was conformed to the recommendations of SSC. RESULTS. We enrolled 44 pts with SS, including 20 with CASS and 24 with HASS. There was no difference in demographic features and comorbidities, including immuno-compromised conditions, haematological malignancy and chronic respiratory diseases .There were no significant differences in hemodynamic variables or indices of tissue perfusion like ScvO 2 (or SvO 2 ) and blood lactate levels, or in amounts of fluids infused or needs of vasopressor agents. The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) after the first 6 has greater for HASS than for CASS patients, but during the ICU stay the need for MV was the same for both groups; similarly, during the ICU stay there was no difference in the need for extracorporeal renal support or need for adrenergic agents. At the beginning the ScvO 2 was around 65% for the entire population. After the first 6 h both groups reached the target of 70%. At the admission 10% of patients had a ScvO 2 less than 50% (12.5% for HASS patients and 7.1% for CASS, without any difference between groups) and 40% of patients had a ScvO 2 higher than 70%. The mean SvO 2 for both groups was higher than 65% already at the beginning of the observational period. CONCLUSION. Only a half of pts with SS or Sho had fever. The presence of fever is often associated with a positive microbiological diagnosis, but better prognosis.

None. INTRODUCTION. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), universally used for assessing comatose states, has the advantage of ease of use making it accessible to all levels of clinical competence. There are, however, significant drawbacks. Its relative subjectivity in the interpretation of verbal and eye responses and its mesencephalic limit in the rostro-caudal assessment of brain vitality. These two drawbacks limit its use particularly in ICU intubated patients.

Managing glucose levels in critically ill hospitalised patients has been shown to play a role in improving clinical outcomes. As a result glycaemic control protocols are widely used in critical care settings and require rapid and frequent testing of patient glucose levels. POC glucose meters have migrated from ambulatory testing into hospital.There is increasing recognition that the clinical accuracy of nearly all commonly used glucose meters are affected by components or substances often present in the blood matrix of critical care patients giving rise to an increase risk of adverse incident. The aim of this study was to challenge the accuracy of a glucose meter designed to correct for these interferences.METHODS. 100 paired random arterial whole blood samples were collected from ICU patients admitted for [72 h, Samples were tested for glucose using Stat Strip Glucose (Nova Biomedical) and the Omni B221 BGA (Roche) routinely used for blood gas analysis.Statistical methods: Spearman Rank Correlation/Regression, Bland-Altman analysis.

Patients admitted to ITU increasingly have significant medical comorbidities that require chronic therapy for adequate control1. On admission to ITU, acute medical problems take precedence and many long term medications, such as thyroxine, may be withheld or ceased. In chronic hypothroidism the patient is physiologically dependent upon ongoing administration of thyroxine. The optimal management of chronic medical conditions such as hypothyroidism within the ITU may be essential to patient recovery and should be a quality assurance issue.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS."}, {"text": "To assess the prescription of thyroxine and the thyroid function in patients admitted to ITU with previously diagnosed chronic hypothyroidism.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "OBJECTIVE."}, {"text": "A six year retrospective review of the electronic records of patients with hypothyroidism who were admitted to a 30 bed tertiary referral hospital ITU from 2002 to 2008 was performed.

Patient demographics, daily thyroid replacement dose/route, thyroid function tests (TSH and free T4) and rate and type of nutrition were obtained. Patients were grouped by their worst recorded TSH according to predefined ranges \\0. CONCLUSIONS. Patients did not receive their thyroid replacement for a significant proportion of their admission. This was predominantly due to either lack of prescription or lack of tolerance of enteral feed. The TSH was appropriate for the free T4 level. A significant proportion of patients (22%) did not have their TSH measured at all. Of those that did, abnormal tests were inconsistently repeated or acted upon. Having processes in place to ensure the appropriate prescription and adjustment of relevant chronic medications is essential in the provision of high quality care in ITU.BACKGROUND. Cell-free DNA has been investigated as a diagnostic marker in many diseases, including acute conditions such as stroke, myocardial infarction, burns, sepsis etc. Its serum and plasma levels have been shown to correlate with disease severity in all those.

The performance of general prognostic models in patients with transplantation in need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission is poor, showing a tendency towards significant underestimation of the risk of dying. The objective of our study is to evaluate the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Score II (APACHE II) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS 3) and their 90 days mortality prediction after liver, renal and pulmonary transplantation [1] [2] [3] .METHODS. This is a prospective cohort study in a transplantation ICU in Porto Alegre, Brazil, during the period of May 2006-December 2007. Clinical data of 501 pos transplantation patients admitted at ICU were collected at admission and SAPS 3 and APACHE II calculated with respective estimated mortality rates.

Discrimination was accessed by the area under the ROC curve (aROC) and calibration by the Hosmer-Lemeshow \u0109 test for the general equation and for regional equations (Southern Europe and Mediterranean countries).The mean age of the patients was 63.9 \u00b1 15.5 years. From the total of the patients, 163 were medical (45.4%), 143 were scheduled surgical (39.8%) and 53 were emergency surgical (14.8%). The mean ICU and hospital mortality was 18.7 and 33.1%. The mean SAPS 3 score was 58.84 points (20-115). Discrimination was good with an aROC of 0.800 (0.752-0.849).There was a statistical significant difference between the mortality predicted by the general equation and the observed mortality (\u0109 = 16.4; p = 0.036); this discrepancy was not significant by using the regional equation (\u0109 = 12.77 and p = 0.12).

No Patients with chronic kidney disease admitted to intensive care have poor outcomes [1, 2] . In 2001 68% of cardiac arrest calls in our hospital were from the renal unit (personal communication.) At this time Critical Care Outreach teams were recommended as means of improving intensive care outcomes through earlier ward assessment of critically ill patients [3] [4] [5] . In 2006 Modified Early Warning System (MEWS) charts to wards and a dedicated seven-day ward-based consultant led service (0800-1800) were introduced on our renal unit [6, 7] . AIMS AND METHODS. The impact of these change interventions was analysed. Primary outcomes were the incidence of cardiac arrests calls to the renal unit, admission APACHE II scores and ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were age, sex, intensive care and hospital length of stay, in-hospital mortality, CPR prior to ICU admission and emergency admissions to the renal unit. Cardiac arrests, mortality rates and emergency admissions were compared with the v 2 test; other outcomes via Mann-Whitney U test. A p value \\ 0.05 was regarded as significant.RESULTS. The results are outlined in the Table 1 [1] ; this group has a high mortality [2] . Deterioration in vital signs often precedes referral to critical care and this is evidenced by a rise in the Patient at Risk Score (PARS). Higher PARS may be associated with worse patient outcomes [3] . Most PARS systems have a trigger value at which critical care input should be sought. We hypothesised that the duration of physiological deterioration prior to critical care admission would be associated with mortality and used the delay between PARS trigger and admission as an estimate of this.METHODS. We collected data on over 200 consecutive patients that had deteriorated on the ward and required admission to general critical care (HDU and ICU) at both acute hospitals in Sheffield. Patients admitted to specialist facilities such as cardiac and neurosurgical units were excluded. Those already triggering at time of hospital admission were also excluded.

Following this audit we have introduced a critical care outreach team and have embarked on an educational programme for staff with emphasis both on the complete and accurate recording of Early Warning Scores and the necessity for appropriate action to be taken on the basis of these scores. AIM. The quality of care prior to ICU admission has been a focus of attention [1] .

INTRODUCTION. Unplanned admissions to intensive care units (ICU) are associated with an increased mortality. In order to identify in-hospital patients at risk of deterioration, several scores based on physiological parameters have been published. However, routine application of these parameters is not common in all European hospitals yet. The goal of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficiency of the current practice of handing over ward patients at risk for decompensation by physicians and nurses. Furthermore, factors associated with admission to the ICU or alarming of the physician on duty should be identified.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS."}, {"text": "The study was conducted at the University hospital of Regensburg, Germany on wards with predominantly gastroenterological and general medical patients (38 beds). Over a time period of 3 months, the daily routine report of patients at risk to the physician on call after hours was recorded. In addition, the nurse assessment of patients at risk and the documentation of the decompensation defined by calling the physician on duty during the night were registered.RESULTS. 526 Patients were treated during the surveillance period. In total, 298 patients (134 women, 164 men) with a mean age of 59 \u00b1 17 years were either judged by the attending physicians or the nurses at risk for deterioration. 260 patients suffered from decompensation during the night shift. Of those, 86 patients were correctly identified by physicians and 69 patients by nurses, respectively. In 12 patients (2%), an ICU admission was necessary.DISCUSSION. Only a small portion of patients reported at risk experienced a severe decompensation at night, defined as ICU admission. Interestingly, those were only in part correctly identified by the physician and nurse reports. A further evaluation of the correlation of those reports with the previously published ''early warning score'', and physiological parameters associated with decompensation are currently being performed in order to estimate the value of standardized patient assessment, and will be presented at the meeting. INTRODUCTION. The need to implement a patient follow-up program after ICU discharge arises from several facts: (1) At ICU discharge patients are now more fragile (aged, chronic comorbidities, complex). (2) The demand for intensive care exceeds its availability. As much as 25% of patients die after discharge from the ICU, many of them in spite of a low predicted mortality, perhaps due to premature ICU discharge. (3) Compared to nursing care in the ICU, the level of that received upon transfer to the floor, as measured by TISS-28, may be reduced up to more than 60%. We believe that, in order to change ICU behavior towards focus on long term outcomes, we need to increase global awareness of disability post-ICU discharges, and expand the involvement of the ICU team in key decision management outside the ICU. We propose an alternative model of care for the critically ill patient. This involves an expanded role for clinicians with expertise in critical illness at several points along the continuum of care.OBJECTIVES. Due to lack of adequate clinical resources to care for some recoverable patients when are discharged to hospital wards after a long time in ICU, we have planned a follow-up program focused in detecting risk factors associated to bad prognosis and, decreasing adverse events in general hospital wards.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "Qualitative, prospective and interventional study realised during seven months (from March to September 2008), in the medical UCI of a teaching hospital in Malaga.

OBJECTIVES. We examined the prevalence of adverse events (AE), suboptimal assessments of vital signs and whether there were advance directives prior to ICU admission from the general wards among patients who died within 30 days of ICU admission.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSIONS."}, {"text": "The patients were those admitted to the general ICU from the general wards at the University Hospital, Lund in 2008 and who died within 30 days after ICU admission. There were 69 patients with a mean age of 73 years and a mean APACHE II score of 26. We used the Global Trigger Tool model for measuring AE (http://www.ihi.org). The frequency of vital functions assessments, and which parameters were controlled were studied in relation to patient status and the local routine for frequency of modified early warning scoring (MEWS).The patient records were also controlled for descisions to forgo treatment before admission to the ICU.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": ". 19 patients (27%) suffered from at least one AE prior to ICU admission. 16 patients had an AE contributing to death, among those14 patients suffered from an AE that with a probability greater than 50% was deemed avoidable. Seven of those patients suffered from a most likely avoidable AE contributing to death.Vital signs were recorded inadequately in 43% of the patients in the 24 h before admission to the ICU. The vital signs most often recorded were blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation, whereas consciousness and breathing frequency were the least recorded parameters.Descisions to forgo resuscitation, or some other limitations due to ethical considerations were found only in 25% of the patients before admission to the ICU.CONCLUSIONS. Patients admitted to the ICU who died within 30 days suffer from a considerable proportion of avoidable AE contributing to death. Vital signs are not recorded in a satisfactory way during the 24 h before admission to the ICU in this most severely ill population. There are very rarely documented descisions to forgo treatment in this group of patients before ICU admission. Thus, poor control of vital signs in the general wards leads to severe and avoidable AE contributing to death. The lack of descisions to forgo treatment before ICU admission in this group of patients most probably contributes to prolonged dying and suffering, and unnecessary intensive care. RESULTS. A significant correlation (p \\ 0.05) was detected between the type of prehospital care and the early outcome among the patients. The majority of the patients was transported by ambulance services (60.6%) from which half of the patients (29.4% of the total) were seen by a paramedic and the rest by a physician beforehand. A relevant proportion of the patients visited the CPU without having been seen by medical personnel (37.5%) before. A smaller group of patients was referred by an attending hospital physician to the CPU (1.8%). 68.2% of all patients were admitted to a cardiologic ward, 15.4% to ICU and 12.1% underwent immediate cardiac catheterization. The rest was referred to other departments within the hospital, other hospitals or was discharged and no one died within 24 h after admission to the CPU. Almost half of the patients (45.2%) who underwent immediate cardiac catheterization was transported by emergency physician car whereas half of the rest (25.4%) visited the CPU as out-patient (p = 0.00). This very similar ratio can be seen within the patient admitted to ICU (27.3%).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "CONCLUSION.
