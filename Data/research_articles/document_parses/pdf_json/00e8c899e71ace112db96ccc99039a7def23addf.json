This was reinforced from March 31st to April 11th, being essential workers the only ones allowed to leave their homes. Until now, the state of emergency is still on. We believe the significant reduction in current stroke admissions might be related to fewer people going to the Emergency Department due to fear of being infected and in response to the measures previously described. This might make sense in minor non-disabling strokes. However, it is hard to assume that a severely disabling stroke, such as those secondary to large-vessel occlusion, did not come to the hospital, even if it was late for reperfusion treatments. Having said that, although there was a decrease in the number of patients who received reperfusion therapies per week, we did not find changes in the proportion of IVT and EVT patients in our region, if we compared it with the total amount of ischaemic strokes for each period. There was also a similar number of low ASPECTS or high NIHSS scores and the same proportion of patients",

Furthermore, possible mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may increase the risk of stroke have been described: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor may act as an entry for SARS-CoV-2 causing neurological complications such stroke through direct and indirect mechanisms 10 . The high level of Ddimer, low platelet count and production of antiphospholipid antibodies predispose to a hypercoagulative state [11] [12] [13] . Besides, SARS-CoV-2 is reported to cause cytokine storm syndromes, which could contribute to stroke. Hypoxia in the central nervous system derived from alveolar gas exchange disorder, cardioembolism due to virus-related cardiac injury, or direct virus nervous system invasion are other proposed mechanisms. Nevertheless, these associations remain to be determined 14 .",

In fact, it is the age group with higher mortality from COVID-19 and also the one with more ischaemic stroke rates. However, this would have increased the proportion of strokes in young adults, which did not happen. Another hypothesis is that some stroke patients could be in a different inpatient area and would have not been transferred to the Neurology ward. Considering the actual hospital organization derived from COVID-19, patients hospitalized with other diseases could either be in isolation units where stroke might not be the major issue or not being paid enough attention to make the diagnosis, which would be a serious inconvenience. As a result, some patients might not be receiving the necessary stroke standard of care.",

The measures adopted to control viral transmission in Spain have led to a drastic and general reduction in urban transportation, industrial activity and other sources of environmental pollution. There has been a 77% decrease in road traffic in main Spanish cities, with a maximum near 90% on weekends. In Zaragoza, this reduction has contributed to a 45% decrease in the NO2 levels registered in the city 16 . It would be tempting to assume that isolation might have contributed to better control of some modifiable stroke risk factors, making it plausible that the decrease in stroke admissions in this period might reflect a real reduction in stroke incidence. However, more studies are needed to make this statement.",

First, the way records were obtained from the SALUD database limits stroke events to the ones which cerebrovascular disease was among the main diagnosis during hospitalization. This did not allow us to thoroughly assess the characteristics of the whole COVID-19 population suffering from ischaemic stroke, but other series analyzing these aspects found that the incidence of acute ischaemic stroke in this population is no more than 5% 21 . Second, the time frame to analyze how SARS-CoV-2 infection and policies affect stroke care is short, but due to the urge for some advice to other countries which are in a previous phase of the epidemic, we considered this registered month significant enough to obtain interesting data that could help stroke centres.",
