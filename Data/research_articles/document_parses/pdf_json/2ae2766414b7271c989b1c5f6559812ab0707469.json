During the last 2 months (from February 14 to April 10, 2020) we observed 33 cases of unusual lesions on acral sites in Italian children and adolescents.

Due to the mild course, none of our patients received clinical or laboratory diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection. However, the temporal coincidence of the reporting of unusual erythema pernio-like lesions with the COVID-19 epidemic suggests that these skin manifestations be considered as possible expression of the COVID-19 infection in children and adolescents. Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 may be rare and in most cases are similar to cutaneous involvement occurring during common viral infections, such as red rashes or urticaria. 1-3 In one adult patient, the first case in Thailand, the rash was associated with petechiae similar to Dengue. 4 The most recent anatomical-pathological investigations have documented not only important and early phenomena of fibrosis, but also thrombotic micro-angiopathy in the lung. 5,6 Moreover, among the monoclonal antibodies, the one with anticoagulant and fibrinolytic properties (such as eculizumab) seems to act better. 7 Although specific skin lesions due to the COVID-19 infection have not been described, the affinity of the virus for the vascular endothelium and the consequent obliterating and thrombotic micro-angiopathy could also be expressed on the skin as petechiae, tiny bruises, livedoid eruptions, or erythema pernio-like lesions. Could these be the initial expressions of the COVID-19 infection in children? Could they be mild or asymptomatic forms the of COVID-19 infection in children? At the moment we have no answers. The detection after a few weeks of the IgM and IgG antibodies in our patients will confirm whether or not these skin manifestations can be considered a sign of the COVID-19 infection in children. Most of our patients were treated with oral paracetamol, antibiotics, anthistamines, and topical steroids. The evolution of the lesions was favorable with complete resolution in 17 of them in periods ranging from 8 to 16 days. Our patient improved after only 4 days of treatment with mometasone furoate and heparin gel. This can be a simple and effective therapy for erythema pernio-like lesions.
