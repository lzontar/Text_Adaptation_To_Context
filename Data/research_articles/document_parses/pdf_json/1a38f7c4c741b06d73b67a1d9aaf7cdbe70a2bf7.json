In secondary analyses, we stratified models by visit type restricted to: 1) child health 86 visits (immunizations and growth monitoring); 2) antenatal care, postnatal care, and family 87 planning; 3) HIV services (including antiretroviral therapy initiation, antiretroviral therapy 88 continuation, and chronic care medical dispensing program visits); and 4) chronic care of 89 non-communicable diseases (hypertension and diabetes). Clinic visit for more than one 90 reason were treated as visits for both conditions. We also conducted stratified analyses by 91 age category (<1, 1-5, 6-19, 20-45, and >45 years old) and by women and men aged 15 years 92 or older. 93 94 To test for robustness to model assumptions, we conducted four sensitivity analyses: 1) we 95 added random slopes by time to the main linear mixed effects model to account for possible 96 temporal autocorrelation and tested this model against the main model with a likelihood 97 ratio test; we fit 2) linear and 3) Poisson generalized estimating equation models clustered by 98 added a quadratic term for time during the post-lockdown period to assess 99 for a non-linear relationship between time and clinic visitation. 100 101 Finally, we conducted an additional sensitivity analysis to assess for the occurrence of in-102 migration into the HDSS catchment area during the lockdown period, which would 103 potentially bias clinic visitation frequency upwards. To do so, we calculated annual visitation 104 frequency at the 11 area clinics for each individual in the dataset for the year prior to the 105 lockdown. We then compared the median number of annual visits per individual in the pre-106 and post-lockdown periods, and the number of individuals with exactly one visit in the past 107 year in the two periods. If a significant in-migration did occur during the lockdown period, we 108 would expect that the median number of annual visits per individual would decrease during 109 the lockdown, whereas the number of individuals with one visit in the past 12 months would 110 increase. 111 112 Patient and Public Involvement 113 This protocol was reviewed and approved by the AHRI Community Advisory Board, who 114 contributed input on the study design and collection measures.
