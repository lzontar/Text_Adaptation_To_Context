In 2014, two groups with expertise in the field expressed conflicting opinions on the effectiveness of CCT based on the same evidence (6, 7) . While one group claimed there was \"little evidence that playing brain games improved underlying broad cognitive abilities\", the other retorted that \"a substantial and growing body of evidence shows that certain cognitive training regimens can significantly improve cognitive function, including in ways that generalize to everyday life.\" Subsequently, Simons et al. criticized many of the industry-sponsored CCT studies on various methodological limitations (8) . In a rebuttal, Harvey et al. noted that the critics may have prematurely come to a wrong conclusion -they cited factors such as incorrect definitions of CCT and described supportive evidence from meta-analyses and large RCTs (8) . Likewise, while an initial online study by Owen et al (9) did not find any benefits of CCT in younger adults, a subsequent study of 2912 older adults by the same group reported that CCT had benefits on both cognition and daily activities (10) .",

The memory group showed no benefits. But five years after initial training, the reasoning group self-reported fewer daily-living problems, whereas speed-of-processing training resulted in fewer at-fault automobile accidents and a smaller decline in health-related quality of life (12) . Further, at 10-year follow up, those on the computerized speed training arm had a 29% reduction in incident dementia rates (13) . A metaanalyses of 52 studies comprising 4,885 cognitively healthy older adults, noted small to moderate beneficial effect sizes for CCT in comparison to control groups in the domains of verbal memory, nonverbal memory, working memory, processing speed, and visuospatial skills (14) . This study also found that group-based training was more efficacious than home-based training -suggesting that future home based CCT may need to be augmented with greater remote supervision and interactions via social media (14) . A meta-analysis of 18 studies of CCT for MCI (N=690) found small to moderate improvements in global cognition, memory and working memory (11) . The largest effect size was on working memory. Whether these improvements result in long-term transfer to clinically meaningful benefits and lowered rates of progression to dementia is not known and require further study. (11) .",

Given the lack of a predicate or product code, CCT for MCI would likely be viewed by the FDA as a Class III device (22) ; however, we believe that a de-novo application to request re-classification of CCT as a lower risk Class II device could be successful. CCT manufacturers should seek advice from regulatory agencies before and during this process as is done with drugs (19) .
