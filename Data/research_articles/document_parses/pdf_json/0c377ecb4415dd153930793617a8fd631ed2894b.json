Many different disciplines try to find solutions and drive strategies to a great variety of different very crucial problems. The present study presents a novel analysis which results to clustering countries with respect to active cases, active cases per population and active cases per population and per area based on Johns Hopkins epidemiological data. The presented cluster results could be useful to a variety of different policy makers, such as physicians and managers of the health sector, economy/finance experts, politicians and even to sociologists. In addition, our work suggests a new specially designed clustering algorithm adapted to the request for comparison of the various COVID time-series of different countries.",

An algorithm to provide consistent clustering of various countries with respect to active cases, active cases per population and active cases per population and per area was developed. Mathematica 10 and SPSS 23 were used to run the relevant code. The final data are the number of cases per day and per date (figure1), the number of cases/1 million inhabitants per day and per date (figure 3), the number of cases/population/land area per day and per date ( figure 5 ). Moreover, this final dataset contains the results of our algorithm for the clustering of these countries for each one of the above cases (figures 2, 4, 6). The final dataset can be retrieved from Mendeley dataset, http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/kg72dst75p.1. Figure 1 shows, at the left, the evolution of cases in each country, starting from the first day of a COVID-19 case, for the thirty countries with the older cases (starting from 2th of January 2020) and, at the right, the 30 countries with the highest number of cases.

Figure 2 shows that China, due to its particular shape, form one cluster alone. Next clustering isolates Iran from the other countries. The third clustering isolates Italy, the fourth a cluster of three countries: Israel, Spain and South Korea, while all other countries are together. A next calculation, not taking into consideration the previous countries, gives the results of the right part of Figure 2 . Here, Belgium and Germany form the first cluster. The second clustering isolates France UK and Sweden from the other countries. Inside this cluster, France is isolated form the other two countries. The clustering of the other counties gives two clusters, one of Japan, Lebanon and Egypt, with Japan being alone in a subsequent clustering. The cluster of the other countries isolates Singapore, then USA and then Vietnam, a cluster of all other countries, except Nepal, Sri Lanka and Cambodia being at the end. The clustering using the date data is also performed. This figure completely changes the clustering. Here, USA is isolated from the first round, then China from the second, then Italy from the third. The fourth round groups 4 clusters, one of Spain, one of Germany, one of France and Iran and one of the other countries. Next clustering isolates UK, and then South Korea and UK from the other countries.",

A thousand active cases is China or in Luxembourg, countries with a population of almost 1.5 million people the first and 600,000 people the latter, don't have the same importance. For this reason, Figure 3 shows the number of cases for each one million of inhabitants of each country. Taking the population into consideration, the situation is completely different. San Marino is the country with the highest number of cases per population, followed by Andorra, Luxembourg, Iceland, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Belgium, France, Austria, Germany, Portugal, Norway, Netherlands and the USA, the country with the higher number of cases today. Left part of Figure 2 shows that the thirty countries with the longest time series of cases are not always in the worst case. Again, the shapes of these countries are very different. As previously, four different shapes can be recognized, but the countries of the third and fourth group so not always remain in their respected groups. Figure 3 shows that the countries with the most critical situation are different than the countries revealed from Figure 1 . Figure 4 shows the clustering of these countries, in per date basis. San Marino is isolated from the first clustering. Second round isolated three countries: Andorra, Iceland and Luxembourg (Andorra is isolated from the other two in the next round) and the other countries. Next round isolates a cluster containing Spain, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Italy, one of Monaco, Austria and Belgium (Monaco is isolated in the next round) and all the other counties remain together.

For this reason, Figure 5 shows the results of Figure 3 divided by the land area. The situation is very different from Figure 3 . Figure 5 reveals that the countries with the most critical situation are the small countries. Monaco is in the first case, far from the second country which is San Marino.

Removing Monaco and San Marino, a cluster with Liechtenstein and Andorra and one with Malta and Luxembourg is obtained, while all other countries remain together (Figure 6 , right). Clustering with respect to active cases means that the elements of these clusters are countries that have similar time evolution of the active cases, which in turn means that they have faced similar stresses to the health system (with exception countries that performed extensive test to the general population; these countries are very few Taiwan, South Korea, Germany). Clustering with respect to active cases per population means that the countries that belong to the same cluster have experienced similar stresses to the society and the economy. Finally, clustering with respect to active cases per population per area is useful for driving conclusions about the impact of the disease that spreads more easily in densely populated areas (countries that have dense big cities are more vulnerable).",

Furthermore, the question could focus on differentiating or likening certain characteristic values, means, trends, patterns of periodicity observed or forecast values.

Various techniques have been used, such us indexing, classification, clustering or detection/identification of abnormal or specific characteristics [2] [3] [4] [5] . A similarity measure metric or non-metric is always used in such techniques. It is evaluated for two or more time series and returns a value for each one of them.",
