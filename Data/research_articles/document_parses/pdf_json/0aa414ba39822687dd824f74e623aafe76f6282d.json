Although hospitals in China reduced outpatient visits and restricted inpatient admission to lower the risk of transmission of COVID-19, this has significantly affected patients in need of medical attention, for example, patients with emotional disorders. Aims This study aimed to compare the beliefs towards COVID-19 among outpatients with emotional disorders (ie, anxiety or depression) with those of family caregivers and the general public and examine factors that shape the beliefs towards COVID-19 among outpatients with emotional disorders. Methods Survey data from 570 outpatients with anxiety or depression disorders, 449 family caregivers and 470 general public subjects were collected. Multiple stepwise regression analyses were used to describe participants' level of concern, prevention attitude and positive expectations towards the COVID-19 outbreak. results About 70.9% of outpatients had to postpone their mental health treatment; 43.2% of patients admitted that their mental health was adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak-these patients tended to be older, male and less educated. After controlling for age and education level, outpatients with emotional disorders had significantly lower levels of concerns but more negative expectations towards COVID-19, compared with family caregivers and the public. Multivariate linear stepwise regression analysis showed that age, education and the perception of the impact of COVID-19 on one's existing mental illness were significantly associated with outpatients' beliefs about the epidemic. Conclusion Outpatients with anxiety or depression disorders were relatively less focused on the COVID-19 outbreak, but the impact of the infection was found to be independently associated with their beliefs towards COVID-19. In addition, outpatients who were older and of low educational levels particularly held more negative beliefs about the epidemic, which may place them at a higher risk for poor mental health.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Since December 2019, when the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, to the present, COVID-19 outbreak has taken the form of a global health crisis as it continues to spread worldwide. The disease is airborne and can easily be transmitted through droplets from cough, sneezes, faeces, and so on. 1 2 It has been designated as a class B infectious disease by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and given its severity, the prevention and control mechanism for class A infectious diseases has been adopted. 3 With the spread of the COVID-19 virus, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, all provinces and cities in China have implemented closed management to residential communities and strengthened personal protection. In light of the contagious nature of COVID-19, the number of visits to hospitals by outpatients was limited to severe cases. In addition, online consultation has been provided to meet the needs of the patients with less critical conditions. As a public crisis, the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic has led to fear, stress and panic in the general public 4 ; needless to say, it has adversely affected those with mental health disorders, such as anxiety or depression. 5 Patients with psychiatric disorders are at a higher risk of acquiring common infectious diseases, 6 7 which also makes them vulnerable to COVID-19 pneumonia. In addition to susceptibility to pneumonia, long-term anxiety or depression further lead to emotional disturbances. These patients also face more invisible barriers in obtaining timely medical attention because of the public's discrimination and neglect towards mental health. 5 8 It is well known that most patients with emotional disorders need regular prescriptions. However, in the wake of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, psychiatric hospitals in China have reduced outpatient visits, tightened admission criteria and shortened the length of hospitalisation, which may hinder the access to prescription drugs or other treatments and cause mental health of these patients to deteriorate. For these reasons, this study aims to investigate the inner beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic among outpatients with anxiety or depression. This study also attempts to identify the factors that influence these inner beliefs, focusing on the effect of their self-perceived impact of COVID-19. This study will help gain insights into the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on one particular vulnerable population: outpatients with anxiety or depression.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 346, "end": 349, "text": "1 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 574, "end": 575, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1277, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1376, "end": 1379, "text": "6 7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1716, "text": "5 8", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "InTroduCTIon"}, {"text": "To fulfil the research aims, this study used a comprehensive online survey design.

A higher score signifies deeper concern and worry for infection. The second subscale is prevention attitude, which indicates people's attitude towards the use of protective measures to prevent COVID-19 infection. The higher the score is, the more likely participants will implement self-protection methods for preventing infections. The third subscale is positive expectations, which signifies confident views of the measures implemented by the government and health authorities to address COVID-19. Higher scores indicate more positive expectations towards future elimination of COVID-19. To further test the rationality of the questionnaire design, five psychiatrists, one nurse and two social workers from Shanghai Mental Health Center (SMHC) evaluated the questionnaire items.

However, these outpatients have been suffering from depression and anxiety. This may be explained by the concept of \"self-focused attention\" in emotional disorders. Previous research has demonstrated the robust relationship between self-focus and negative affect of anxiety or depression. 10 11 This means they tend to focus on their own negative thoughts or feelings, 10 showing insensitivity or little reactivity to outer environment. 12 This suggests that the patients' negative emotions may emanate from their own internal emotional and cognitive causes and not from the COVID-19 epidemic, whereas the public tends to be bothered more by the risks of being infected. Another interesting finding is that while the outpatients' future epidemic prospect was inclined to positive anticipation, they were more negative than the general public. The general public tends to hold more positive outlook towards the future than those with emotional disorders, which was also revealed in a previous study that found depression, anxiety and negative cognition were moderately and positively correlated. 11 It is speculated General Psychiatry that people with emotional problems are more likely to project the adverse effects of daily stress events. According to the classical Beck's cognitive model, a negative bias is prone to slant incoming information in a worse direction and increase the subjective irrational evaluations or even false alarms. 13 The mode of depression or anxiety could cause exaggerated interpretation of the COVID-19 threat, which would result in the onset of negative expectations. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, nearly half of the outpatients with emotional disorders such as depression or anxiety were negatively affected while more than 70% of them had to postpone their hospital visits. At the same time, respondents who thought that the epidemic had an impact on their initial mental illness had a strong common link with dimensions of the epidemic belief. Among them, impacted outpatients had deeper concerns, weaker prevention attitudes and positive expectations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with mental illness were more prone to loneliness and exhibited social alienation during isolation, 14 thus social decline is deeply associated with depression levels and duration maintenance for patients. 15 16 A previous study has shown the positive significance of social interactions for mood improvement. 17 For patients with anxiety, being confined to their home as well as the lack of positive activities may intensify their attention to potential threat information. They are also prone to forming cognitive biases that are difficult to change, thus leading to a vicious circle. 18 As a general situation, the postponed consultation caused by the epidemic may also break down drug compliance routine, thereby making their beliefs more negative.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 453, "end": 458, "text": "10 11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 533, "end": 535, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 601, "end": 603, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1261, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1607, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2512, "end": 2517, "text": "15 16", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2616, "end": 2618, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2893, "end": 2895, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Main findings"}, {"text": "The results of this study showed that age was an influential factor with respect to the patient's belief during the epidemic period. Older patients tended to be more worried about infection, had lower confidence of selfprevention, as well as held more negative expectations towards the outlook of overcoming the COVID-19. The elderly outpatients also displayed a lower consciousness to reducing the infection risks. Furthermore, the age of outpatients impacted by the epidemic was relatively higher than that of non-impacted patients. However, there was no significant difference in the age groups of the general public regarding their epidemic belief. The foregoing results indicate that elderly outpatients could be more susceptible to the epidemic impact, which consequently affects their inner mental states. Thus, there is a heightened need to address elderly patients with emotional disorders. The elderly population has more underlying chronic conditions and accounts for a large proportion of confirmed death cases due to COVID-19. In addition, the epidemic has to a great extent delayed access to medical services and resources. For example, elderly patients who cannot use technology to fill prescription drugs online may experience more fear and anxiety, which may make them susceptible to diseases including COVID-19. A community survey showed that older people who were forced to live alone faced overwhelming stress and little social support. 19 Decline in the frequency of visits from relatives and friends, lack of companionship from children, pressure from the social anomie caused by the epidemic crisis and the limited access to mental health consultation during the epidemic quarantine period may significantly aggravate their anxiety, depression and negative thoughts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1457, "end": 1459, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Main findings"}, {"text": "The study also showed that compared with highly educated patients, patients with lower education reported more subjective concerns about infections, less engagement in prevention strategies and lower positive expectations towards the future.
