However, the role of Eomes and its molecular program in mature NK cell biology is unclear. To address this, we develop a tamoxifen-inducible, type-1-ILC-specific (Ncr1-targeted) cre mouse and combine this with Eomes-floxed mice. Eomes deletion after normal NK cell ontogeny results in a rapid loss of NK cells (but not ILC1s), with a particularly profound effect on penultimately mature stage III NK cells. Mechanisms responsible for stage III reduction include increased apoptosis and impaired maturation from stage II precursors. Induced Eomes deletion also decreases NK cell cytotoxicity and abrogates in vivo rejection of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-class-I-deficient cells. However, other NK cell functional responses, and stage IV NK cells, are largely preserved. These data indicate that mature NK cells have distinct Eomes-dependent and -independent stages.",

NK cells protect against infection and mediate antitumor responses via two primary effector functions: production of immunomodulatory cytokines and direct cytotoxicity (Caligiuri, 2008; Vivier et al., 2008) . NK cells recognize target cells based on the integration of signals from numerous germline DNA-encoded activating and inhibitory receptors. In general, activating receptors recognize cell stress ligands, while inhibitory receptors recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (Lanier, 2005) . In addition, NK cells constitutively express cytokine receptors that support their development and tune their function by ligating activating or inhibitory signals in the surrounding environment (Romee et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2010) .",

ILC development begins in the bone marrow (BM) from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), which gives rise to both the NK and helper ILC lineages. Thereafter, most terminal NK cell maturation takes place in peripheral tissues (Cherrier et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2013) . The NK progenitor (NKP) differentiates through several NK cell maturation stages classically characterized based on the presence or absence of the surface markers CD27 and CD11b (Chiossone et al., 2009 ). In addition, the activating receptor NKp46, encoded by Ncr1, is induced during stage I (CD27 \u00c0 CD11b \u00c0 ) of differentiation, followed by the integrin CD49b (DX5), and MHC-class-Irecognizing Ly49 activating and inhibitory receptors (Yu et al., 2013) . Numerous transcription factors are required to regulate ILC development and promote the different lineages (Ishizuka et al., 2016; Leong et al., 2017) . NK cells and ILC1s both express T-bet, but of type-1 ILCs, only NK cells express Eomesodermin (Eomes), another T-box transcription factor critical for their development (Colonna, 2018) . Recent data have revealed that NK cells and ILC1s exhibit plasticity depending on their environment and specifically that NK cells can convert to ILC1-like cells in transforming growth factor b (TGF-b)-rich tumors and tissues (Berrien-Elliott et al., 2019; Cortez et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2017) , which can involve downregulation of Eomes.",

Eomes, like T-bet, regulates gene expression by binding T-box DNA elements. Eomes is generally required for early embryonic development, as evidenced by mice with global Eomes gene deletion exhibiting embryonic lethality (Russ et al., 2000) . An important role for Eomes has been demonstrated in CD8 T cell biology; it promotes the development of central memory CD8 T cells as well as the cytotoxic T cell effector program by positively regulating interferon g (IFN-g), perforin, and granzyme B (Banerjee et al., 2010; Intlekofer et al., 2005; Pearce et al., 2003) .

Eomes is expressed by NK cells of all maturation stages, with highest expression in the relatively immature stage II and III populations (Gordon et al., 2012) . NK cell terminal maturation is thought to rely on T-bet, whose expression increases in terminally mature (stage IV) NK cells, opposite to the decrease in Eomes (Daussy et al., 2014; Townsend et al., 2004) . Functionally, Eomes expression correlates with NK cell IFN-g production in vivo (Gill et al., 2012) and Prf1 transcription (Pearce et al., 2003) , but T-bet has also been shown to regulate NK cell cytotoxic protein expression (Townsend et al., 2004) . Thus, the importance of Eomes in mature NK cell homeostasis and function remains unclear. Studies of Eomes in NK cell homeostasis and function have been limited by a lack of appropriate inducible genetic models. In the constitutive Ncr1-cre models available (and similarly for Vav1-cre), cre-driven Eomes deletion in immature BM NK cells results in abrogation of NK cell development and thus precludes the study of Eomes in mature NK cell biology (Gordon et al., 2012; Pikovskaya et al., 2016) . Indeed, what were once thought to be Eomes-negative NK cells in such constitutive models are now better understood to have been type 1 ILCs (Gordon et al., 2012) . To overcome this limitation, we developed a type-1-ILC-specific tamoxifen-inducible cre mouse model and confirmed its properties using a Rosa26-YFP reporter allele. Eomes-floxed mice were crossed to this model in order to elucidate the role of Eomes in mature NK cell biology. Here, we studied the impact of induced Eomes deletion on mature NK cell homeostasis and function. We demonstrate that there are Eomes-dependent (stage II/III) and independent (stage IV) murine NK cell subsets and that loss of Eomes does not reverse NK cell maturation, as has been previously suggested (Gordon et al., 2012) . In addition, we demonstrate a requirement of ongoing Eomes expression for NK cell cytotoxicity and in vivo responses to MHC-I-deficient target cells.",

In these models, cre expression initiates with normal Ncr1 gene expression in immature BM stage I NK cells (Walzer et al., 2007) . Hence, loxP-directed excision events occur early in NK cell development, precluding the study of developmentally critical genes in mature NK cells. To overcome this barrier, we developed a type-1-ILC-specific, tamoxifen-inducible cre mouse ( Figure 1A ) generated by genetic targeting of a tamoxifen-responsive iCreER T2 cassette into the Ncr1 locus. This cassette is linked to NKp46 C-terminal translation via a P2A ribosomal skip site. This Ncr1-iCreER T2 model was crossed to a reporter allele consisting of a lox-stop-lox (LSL)-flanked YFP cassette genetically targeted to the Rosa26 locus in order to track cre nuclear activity (Srinivas et al., 2001) . To test the timing of cre expression in this model, mice underwent oral gavage with 3 mg tamoxifen for 3 consecutive days (Heger et al., 2014; Herold et al., 2014) , and 3 days later, YFP expression was analyzed in various tissues ( Figure 1B ). YFP expression was observed in NKp46 + cells of the blood, spleen, and liver (R90% YFP + ) as well as BM and lymph node (LN) (R80% YFP + ). YFP expression was restricted to NKp46 + cells and not expressed by other hematopoietic lineages, including T cells ( Figure 1B ; data not shown). Similar to other iCreER T2 models (Kristianto et al., 2017; Maurel et al., 2019) , mature (8-to 12-week-old) Ncr1-iCreER T2 mice had small background levels of cre nuclear localization ($5%-10%) in NKp46 + cells in the absence of tamoxifen that increased slowly over time ( Figures 1B and S1 ). Therefore, in this report, experiments were performed in 8-to 12-week-old mice unless otherwise noted.",

Notably, induced Eomes deletion had a particularly profound effect on less mature stage II (CD27 + CD11b \u00c0 ) and stage III (CD27 + CD11b + ) NK cells. Stage III NK cells, in particular, were significantly decreased in number and percentage in all tissues analyzed ( Figure 2B ). While stage IV (CD27 \u00c0 CD11b + ) NK cell numbers were reduced in the blood, BM, and LN in ILC-Eomes D/D mice, their relative proportion increased in all tissues except the liver, where it was unchanged. As expected, Eomes-dependent NK cells were decreased in both the proportion of YFP + NKp46 + cells and absolute number in the liver, while the proportion of Eomes-independent ILC1s increased, but numbers remained unchanged ( Figure 2C ) (Sojka et al., 2014) . Despite evidence that Eomes and T-bet negatively cross-regulate one another (Daussy et al., 2014) , we did not observe increased T-bet protein levels in ILC-Eomes D/D NK cells ( Figure 2D ). Thus, induced Eomes deletion negatively affects NK cell numbers and homeostasis, particularly those of the stage III subset.",

            "text": "We hypothesized that the decrease in NK cell numbers observed following Eomes deletion could be the result of enhanced apoptosis or altered cell cycling. This was tested at an earlier time point after tamoxifen gavage (Tam-3d), when cells undergoing apoptosis or attempting to proliferate may still be quantifiable. At this time point, >70% of splenic ILC-Eomes D/D and control NK cells were YFP + , Eomes protein was nearly absent, and reductions in NK cells had started but were more modest compared to the Tam-6d time point ( Figures 3A and 3B) . A significantly greater fraction of apoptotic (Annexin V + ) stage III NK cells were present in the spleen and BM of ILC-Eomes D/D compared to WT mice ( Figure 3C ). This was associated with a significant in-crease in caspase activation in splenic stage III NK cells of ILC-Eomes D/D compared to control mice ( Figure 3D ). To further understand this apoptosis phenotype, we performed unbiased RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of flow-sorted stage II, III, and IV ILC-Eomes D/D and WT splenic NK cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the RNA-seq data revealed significant enrichment of the Hallmark Apoptosis Pathway in ILC-Eomes D/D , compared to WT, stage II NK cells ( Figure 3E ). This enrichment was not observed in stage III or IV NK cell comparisons (Figure S2) . These data are consistent with the observed loss of stage III NK cells, as they suggest that induced Eomes deletion activates apoptotic machinery in stage II NK cells that die at stage III. ILC-Eomes D/D and WT NK cells were also co-stained for Ki67 (a marker of proliferation) and DNA content to assess cell-cycle dynamics ( Figures 3F, 3G , and S3A). The cell-cycle distribution of bulk, stage II, and stage IV NK cells was identical between WT and ILC-Eomes D/D mice in the spleen and BM ( Figure S3B ). However, a significantly greater percentage of stage III NK cells were in G1 in ILC-Eomes D/D compared to WT mice ( Figure 3F ). No cells progressed to S/G2/M, however, even when analyzed an additional day after the Tam-3d regimen ( Figure 3G ). This suggests that induced Eomes deletion promotes a G0 to G1 transition in stage III NK cells, yet the cell cycle is unable to progress beyond that point, possibly due to cell-cycle-arrest-related apoptosis. Eomes-deleted NK cells are capable of cell division, however, as demonstrated via transfer experiments into a homeostatic proliferation environment ( Figure S4 ). Here, both ILC-Eomes D/D and Eomes WT YFP + splenic NK cells showed robust and comparable proliferation 14 days post-transfer into Rag2 \u00c0/\u00c0 gc \u00c0/\u00c0 recipient mice ( Figure S4B ). While restrictions on our flow panel did not allow for stage-specific analyses, given the deleterious effect of Eomes on stage III NK cell numbers, we hypothesize that the proliferated ILC-Eomes D/D NK cells were largely stage II and IV. Short-term proliferation of ILC-Eomes D/D and WT YFP + NK cells after 4 days in vivo was also similar but significantly reduced compared to cre-negative NK cells, suggesting that induction of cre concurrent with a strong proliferation signal may alter normal cellular proliferation ( Figure S4A ) (Loonstra et al., 2001) . Collectively, these findings suggest that Eomes loss promotes stage III apoptosis either by directly activating apoptotic genes in precursor stage II NK cells or as a result of cell-cycle arrest.",

STAT5, in particular, is known to be critical for NK cell survival, since it promotes the transcription of anti-apoptotic molecules like Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 (Huntington et al., 2007; Ranson et al., 2003) . Since Eomes is known to regulate the b chain of the IL-15R (CD122) (Intlekofer et al., 2005) , we hypothesized that induced Eomes deletion resulted in decreased expression of the intermediate-affinity (b/g) IL-15R and thus decreased IL-15 signaling and STAT5 phosphorylation in vivo, leading to stage III NK cell apoptosis. Indeed, a significant decrease in CD122 expression on both stage II/III and stage IV Tam-3d-treated ILC-Eomes D/D compared to WT NK cells was observed (Figure 4A) . We used phospho-flow cytometry to interrogate activation of downstream signaling pathways in response to low-dose (10 ng/mL) and high-dose (100 ng/mL) IL-15 in NK cells from WT and ILC-Eomes D/D mice treated with the Tam-3d regimen (Figure 4B) . Unexpectedly, we observed no defect in pSTAT5 activation at either IL-15 concentration tested and, accordingly, no Figure S5A ). In contrast, pERK and pAkt median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was decreased in ILC-Eomes D/D compared to WT stage II/III NK cells in response to low-dose, but not high-dose, IL-15. This is consistent with higher levels of IL-15 being required to activate these pathways, compared to STAT5, in murine NK cells (Mar\u00e7 ais et al., 2014) . While they are not considered to be the principal regulators of NK cell apoptosis, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK pathways have been shown to play important roles in promoting NK cell survival (Huntington et al., 2007) . However, stage III NK cells were not rescued in mice that received exogenous IL-15 concomitantly with tamoxifen ( Figures S5B-S5D) . Thus, the negative effect of Eomes deletion on stage III NK cell survival is likely not the result of impaired IL-15 signaling.",

            "text": "In Vivo The PI3K and MAPK pathways are involved in other aspects of NK cell homeostasis, including maturation (Tassi et al., 2007) . We hypothesized that the stage III NK cell defect might also be due to impaired maturation from precursor stage II cells. To test this hypothesis, we treated ILC-Eomes D/D and WT mice with the Tam-3d regimen then sorted YFP + CD27 + (stage II/III) or YFP + CD27 \u00c0 CD11b + (stage IV) NK cells, transferred them into congenic recipients, and allowed them to mature for 2 weeks in vivo ( Figure 5A ) (Sullivan et al., 2015) . Stage IV NK cells from both ILC-Eomes D/D and WT control mice were stable and remained stage IV after 2 weeks ( Figure 5B ), contrary to previous results utilizing ex vivo TAT-cre-induced Eomes deletion (Gordon et al., 2012) . However, the majority of ILC-Eomes D/D NK cells that were stage II/III at the time of transfer were stage II after 2 weeks in vivo, with only a small number of stage IV NK cells developing. This was in contrast to WT cells that showed expected in vivo maturation ( Figures 5B and 5C ). To account for any bias introduced by sorting on YFP + cells, this experiment was repeated by sorting stage II/III or stage IV cell trace violet (CTV)-labeled NK cells from ILC-Eomes D/D or CD45.1 WT mice prior to tamoxifen, and co-transferring cells of the same stage into CD45.2 recipients. The recipient mice were then treated with 3 days of tamoxifen, and in vivo maturation was assessed 2 weeks later with similar results ( Figure S6 ). These in vivo maturation experiments indicate that Eomes is required for normal stage II to III NK cell maturation. Thus, the particularly profound defect in stage III NK cells following Eomes deletion also arises from a stage II to III maturation block. Eomes Deletion Impairs NK Cell Cytotoxicity, but Not Cytokine Production ILC-Eomes D/D mice were next used to assess the impact of Eomes deletion on mature NK cell function. To assess ex vivo cytotoxic responses, we treated ILC-Eomes D/D and WT mice with the Tam-3d regimen, and on the 2 nd day of tamoxifen also administered poly(I:C), a synthetic Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist that activates NK cells (Fehniger et al., 2007) . 24 h later, splenocytes were harvested, and enriched NK cells were used as effectors in flow-based killing assays against MHC-class Ideficient RMA-S leukemia targets. We observed a significant decrease in RMA-S killing by ILC-Eomes D/D NK cells at both effector-to-target ratios examined ( Figure 6A ). NK cells were equally enriched in the two groups ( Figure 6B ), demonstrating that the killing defect was not due to different numbers of ILC-Eomes D/D versus control NK cells, but rather was cell-intrinsic. NK cell killing of target cells involves the targeted release of cytotoxic-protein-containing granules. Granzyme B protein levels were not affected by induced Eomes deletion ( Figure 6C ), consistent with prior reports showing robust granzyme B protein levels in Eomes-deficient ILCs (Gordon et al., 2012) . However, RNA-seq analysis revealed a R2-fold decrease in perforin mRNA in stage II and III ILC-Eomes D/D relative to WT NK cells ( Figure S7A ), consistent with prior reports of NK cell perforin regulation by Eomes (Intlekofer et al., 2005) . Indeed, we performed Eomes chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on primary, IL-15-expanded murine NK cells and confirmed the Prf1 transcription start site to be a direct target of Eomes (Table S1 ). In addition, since inducible Eomes deletion might impact the NK cell granular exocytosis pathway more globally (Galandrini et al., 2013) , we performed GSEA of our RNA-seq data for the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway and observed significant downregulation of this pathway in ILC-Eomes D/D compared to WT NK cells of all stages ( Figure S7B ). Thus, induced Eomes deletion appears to affect several components of the NK cell cytotoxic program, including perforin.",

The most consistent was a modest deficit in ILC-Eomes D/D stage II NK cell functional responses to anti-NK1.1 ligation ( Figure 6E ).

Indeed, the WT:b2 m \u00c0/\u00c0 ratio of transferred cells in the spleen after 18-20 h was the same for ILC-Eomes D/D mice as it was for negative control mice that had been NK cell depleted. Alterations in the NK cell Ly49 repertoire could underlie this finding, and prior publications have demonstrated that Eomes is required for the generation of a diverse Ly49 repertoire, but not its maintenance (Gordon et al., 2012) . However, there were no substantial differences in Ly49 receptor expression between ILC-Eomes D/D and WT NK cells ( Figure 7D ), suggesting that Ly49 alterations were unlikely to account for the impaired in vivo rejection phenotype. Thus, the impaired ex vivo cytotoxicity of ILC-Eomes D/D NK cells was manifest in vivo, as the cells showed no ability to reject MHC-class-I-deficient targets.",

Since constitutive Ncr1-cre and Vav-cre models delete genes early in NK cell development (stage I or earlier), they preclude the study of genes required for normal NK cell ontogeny (like Eomes). In addition, global inducible models are complicated by cell-extrinsic effects and the requirement for adoptive transfer experiments (Madera et al., 2018) . To overcome these limitations, we developed a highly penetrant, tamoxifen-inducible type-1-ILC-specific cre mouse. A transgenic inducible model that expressed cre in a small minority of NKp46 + cells was previously reported but lacked highly penetrant type 1 ILC-specific gene targeting (Nabekura and Lanier, 2016) . The Ncr1-iCreER T2 reported here results in near-complete Eomes protein loss throughout the NK cell compartment in 2 days and permitted the demonstration of a persistent requirement for Eomes in mature NK cell homeostasis and function. Like most cre-loxP systems, our Ncr1-iCreER T2 model has limitations that must be considered during experimental design, including small background levels of cre expression in older mice and potentially altered proliferation kinetics. These limitations reinforce the importance of having a reporter for cre activity in experimental mice.",

            "text": "Eomes deletion negatively affected NK cell homeostasis, with a particularly profound effect on stage III NK cells. We determined that the stage III deficit arose from several mechanisms, including increased apoptosis (likely caspase dependent), altered cell cycling, and impaired maturation from stage II NK cells. IL-15-induced activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK was impaired in response to low-dose IL-15 in ILC-Eomes D/D NK cells, yet exogenous IL-15 failed to rescue stage III NK cells in vivo. Thus, Eomes appears to regulate NK cell survival via mechanisms that are not rescued by exogenous IL-15. Indeed, we observed enrichment of apoptosis-related genes specifically in ILC-Eomes D/D compared to WT stage II NK cells, which likely undergo cell death as they transition to stage III. These data reveal a role for Eomes in regulating hematopoietic cell apoptosis, a greater understanding of which could potentially lead to novel ways of supporting NK cells in the setting of adoptive transfer. The deficit in PI3K and MAPK activation by IL-15 at physiologic cytokine levels could, however, contribute to the maturation defect observed in stage II ILC-Eomes D/D NK cells (Tassi et al., 2007) . Importantly, and in contrast to prior models that induced Eomes deletion ex vivo in mature NK cells (Gordon et al., 2012) , we demonstrate that mature (stage IV) NK cells are largely Eomes independent and do not revert to an immature state if Eomes is lost. In addition, although we saw no overall deficits in NK cell homeostatic proliferation upon induced Eomes deletion, stage-specific analyses as well as investigations of activation or inflammation-driven proliferation were not performed and will be important to fully appreciate the impact of Eomes deletion on NK cell proliferation. For the last decade, NK cell maturation has largely been classified based on CD27 and CD11b expression (Chiossone et al., 2009 ). Our findings Figure 7 .

As such, stage II/III NK cells are Eomes dependent, while stage IV NK cells are predominantly Eomes independent. Terminally mature NK cells downregulate Eomes and upregulate T-bet, and so we hypothesize that stage IV NK cell homeostasis is T-bet dependent. Additional studies utilizing the inducible cre model with both T-bet and Eomes floxed alleles will clarify these T-box transcription factor requirements.",

            "text": "Functionally, we observed that induced Eomes deletion impaired NK cell killing, as evidenced by both in vivo rejection of MHC-class-I-deficient splenocytes and ex vivo killing of tumor target cells. While the decreased NK cell number arising from induced Eomes deletion could be a contributing factor, the killing defect in vivo was disproportionate to the NK cell deficit, and the ex vivo killing assay was performed with equal NK cell numbers. Thus, Eomes deletion impairs NK cell killing in vivo and ex vivo via NK-cell-intrinsic mechanisms. NK cells kill via exocytosis of cytotoxic-protein-containing granules and via the ligation of death receptors on target cells. Ongoing Eomes-regulated transcription is not required for short-term granzyme B protein expression, as we observed no reduction in granzyme B protein levels in ILC-Eomes D/D compared to WT NK cells. In contrast, RNA-seq revealed a significant reduction in perforin mRNA in ILC-Eomes D/D stage II and III NK cells compared to WT, and Eomes ChIP-seq confirmed Prf1 to be an NK cell target of Eomes. While we were unable to quantify perforin protein due to technical limitations of available flow-based antibodies, decreases in perforin protein are likely to have occurred given the perforin sensitivity of RMA-S cells (Wallin et al., 2003) . However, perforin mRNA was unchanged by induced Eomes deletion in stage IV NK cells, and since these cells are major NK cytotoxic mediators, this suggested that other components of the NK cell cytotoxic machinery may have been altered by induced Eomes deletion. Indeed, we observed downregulation of the KEGG NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway in ILC-Eomes D/D NK cells of all stages, demonstrating a broader role for Eomes in regulating NK cell cytotoxicity. It is also possible that alterations in death receptor ligand expression contributed to the killing defects observed. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), in particular, is expressed on tissue-resident, Eomes-negative ILC1s, so it is possible that it is upregulated upon Eomes deletion. However, RMA-S cells are relatively TRAIL and FasL resistant in short-term killing assays (Screpanti et al., 2001; Wallin et al., 2003) . Thus, while it will be important to investigate death receptor ligand expression and function on ILC-Eomes D/D NK cells in the future, they likely did not contribute substantially to our cytotoxicity phenotype.",

It has been suggested that Eomes may be important for sustained NK cell functional responses and that Eomes downregulation, for example in cells infiltrating a tumor, might be a sign of NK cell exhaustion (Gill et al., 2012) . As such, it will be informative to perform studies of sustained NK cell function (such as infection with murine cytomegalovirus [MCMV] or tumors) using our inducible cre system to assess the role of Eomes in these types of NK cell responses. Intrigu-ingly, our ChIP-seq data, performed on IL-15-expanded NK cells, revealed a weak binding peak near the granzyme B promoter (Table S1 ). We speculate that in settings of sustained activation, Eomes may play a role in regulating the expression of this cytotoxic protein as well and that this may be a mechanism through which Eomes loss contributes to NK cell exhaustion. A greater understanding of how Eomes deletion affects the entire NK-cell-activating (e.g., NKG2D and NKp30) and inhibitory (e.g., NKG2A) repertoire will also be important to fully understand virus and tumor model findings.",

ILC-Eomes D/D and Eomes WT cells of the same stage were pooled and injected into male CD45.2 WT mice, who then received 3 daily doses of 3mg tamoxifen in corn oil via oral gavage. 2 weeks later, recipient mice were sacrificed and the stage of CTV+YFP+ (ILC-Eomes D/D ) and CTV+CD45.1+ (WT) cells analyzed by flow cytometry. In vivo homeostatic proliferation ILC-Eomes D/D and Eomes WT mice along with Cre-CD45.1 WT controls were treated with the Tam-3d regimen. Splenocytes were CTV-labeled, then NK cells were purified from pooled splenocytes via negative selection (StemCell Technologies, Inc.) and sorted to NK1.1+CD3-YFP+ (ILC-Eomes D/D and WT) or NK1.1+CD3-(CD45.1WT).

ChIP sequencing In 3 separate experiments, purified NK cells from pooled CD45.2 Eomes WT splenocytes were expanded in vitro for 4 days with 100ng/mL IL-15. Cells were then harvested and approximately 10 3 10 6 cells were used per ChIP experiment. Chromatin immunoprecipiation was performed using the MAGnify Chromatin Immunoprecipitation System (Thermo Fisher) as per manufacturer's instructions with a ChIP-grade anti-Eomes antibody from Abcam (ab23345). Non-immunoprecipitated DNA was used as an input control. ChIP DNA was blunt ended, had addition of ''A'' base to 3 0 end, and had sequencing adapters ligated to the ends. The fragments were size selected to 200-600 base pairs, and underwent amplification for 15 cycles with primers incorporating p5 and p7 sequences and a unique index tag for multiplexing. The resulting libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq3000 as single reads extending 50 bases. The raw data was demultiplexed and aligned to the reference genome using Novoalign",
