            "text": "Cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) are generally triggered by stress-induced 3 translation arrest for storing mRNAs. Recently, it has been shown that SGs exert anti-4 viral functions due to their involvement in protein synthesis shut off and recruitment of 5 innate immune signaling intermediates. The largest RNA virus, coronavirus, mutates 6 frequently and circulates among animals, imposing great threat to public safety and 7 animal health; however, the significance of SGs in coronavirus infections is largely 8 unknown. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the first identified coronavirus in 1930s 9 and has been prevalent in poultry farm for many years. In this study, we provide 10 evidence that IBV overcomes the host antiviral response by inhibiting SGs formation 11 via the virus-encoded endoribonuclease nsp15. By immunofluorescence analysis, we 12 observed that IBV infection not only did not trigger SGs formation in approximately 13 80% of the infected cells, but also impaired the formation of SGs triggered by heat 14 shock, sodium arsenite, or NaCl stimuli. We show that the intrinsic endoribonuclease 15 activity of nsp15 is responsible for the inhibition of SGs formation. In fact, nsp15-16 defective recombinant IBV (rIBV-nsp15-H238A) greatly induced the formation of SGs, 17 along with accumulation of dsRNA and activation of PKR, whereas wild type IBV 18 failed to do so. Consequently, infection with rIBV-nsp15-H238A triggered 19 transcription of IFN-\u03b2 which in turn greatly affected recombinant virus replication. 20 Further analysis showed that SGs function as antiviral hub, as demonstrated by the 21 attenuated IRF3-IFN response and increased production of IBV in SG-defective cells. 22 Additional evidence includes the aggregation of PRRs and signaling intermediates to 23 the IBV-induced SGs. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the endoribonuclease 24 nsp15 of IBV suppresses the formation of antiviral hub SGs by regulating the 25 accumulation of viral dsRNA and by antagonizing the activation of PKR, eventually 26 ensuring productive virus replication. We speculate that coronaviruses employ similar 27 mechanisms to antagonize the host anti-viral SGs formation for efficient virus 28 replication, as the endoribonuclease function of nsp15 is conserved in all coronaviruses.",

            "text": "29 3 30 Author summary 31 It has been reported that stress granules (SGs) are part of the host cell antiviral 32 response. Not surprisingly, viruses in turn produce an array of antagonists to counteract 33 such host response. Here, we show that IBV inhibits the formation of SGs through its 34 endoribonuclease nsp15, by reducing the accumulation of viral dsRNA, evading the 35 activation of PKR, and by subsequently inhibiting eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and SGs 36 formation. Nsp15 also inhibits SG formation independent of the eIF2\u03b1 pathway, 37 probably by targeting host mRNA. Depletion of SG scaffold proteins decreases IRF3-38 IFN response and increases the production of IBV. All coronaviruses encode a 39 conserved endoribonuclease nsp15, and it will be important to determine whether also 40 other (non-avian) coronaviruses limit the formation of anti-viral SGs in a similar 41 manner. 42 Introduction 43 RNA viruses must generate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in order to replicate 44 their genome. Host cells consequently employ a variety of pattern recognition (PRRs) 45 receptors to detect dsRNA and trigger innate antiviral responses, which play a pivotal 46 and critical role in fighting viral infections [1]. The host dsRNA-activated protein 47 kinase R (PKR) is a key element of innate antiviral defenses [2]. Following binding to 48 dsRNA, PKR undergoes auto-phosphorylation and phosphorylates the alpha subunit of 49 eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF2\u03b1) on serine 51 [2, 3]. Phospho-eIF2\u03b1 tightly binds to 50 eIF2\u03b2, prevents the recycling of ternary complex tRNA Met -GTP-eIF2, and inhibits 43S 51 translation complex formation, leading to global translation shut off, severely impairing 52 virus replication [4]. In addition to PKR, there are three other eIF2\u03b1 kinases involved 53 in translation inhibition: PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), general 54 control nonderepressible protein 2 (GCN2), and heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI), 55 which senses unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nutrient 56 starvation/UV[5, 6], and oxidative stress, respectively [7-9]. The translation inhibition 57 leads to polysome disassembly and the subsequent assembly of stress granules (SGs), 4 58 a membrane-less, highly dynamic warehouse for storing mRNA and translation 59 components [10]. SGs assembly is driven by aggregation-prone cellular RNA-binding 60 proteins: Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), T cell-restricted 61 intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), and TIA-1-related protein (TIAR) [11-13] . Meanwhile, 62 the post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, poly (ADP)-ribosylation, 63 O-linked N-acetyl glucosamination, phosphorylation, and dephosphorylation, regulate 64 the SGs formation by modifying the components of SGs [14, 15]. Once stress is relieved 65 and translation activities are restored, SGs are disassembled and mRNAs rapidly 66 resume translation [16]. 67 In addition to PKR, there are other two groups of PRRs to recognize dsRNA, 68 namely Toll like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) [17, 18]. One of the 69 TLRs, TLR3, located on the endosomal membrane, senses dsRNA and single stranded 70 RNA (ssRNA) generated by RNA virus or DNA virus. This in turn activates either the 71 NF-\u03baB or IRF3/7 pathway, resulting in boosting the production of proinflammatory 72 cytokines and type I interferon (IFN) [19]. Another group of essential PRRs, RLRs, 73 composed of RIG-I and MDA5, ubiquitously exist in the cytoplasm of mammal cells, 74 recognize 5'-pppRNA and long dsRNA derived from RNA virus, respectively.",

Consequently, the secretion of type I IFN stimulates 79 the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the JAK-STAT pathway, which 80 protect neighboring cells from virus infection [23]. 81 Recent evidence has shown that PKR and RLRs are localized to SGs during virus 82 infection [24]. It is proposed that SGs exert specific antiviral activities by providing a 83 platform for interaction between antiviral proteins and non-self RNA. To accomplish 84 efficient replication, some viruses have evolved various mechanisms to circumvent the 85 formation of anti-viral SGs. For instance, Influenza A Virus (IAV) NS1 protein and 86 Vaccinia virus E3L sequester dsRNA from PKR [25, 26], Ebola virus sequesters SG",

We next explored whether IBV interfered with the 196 phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 triggered by sodium arsenite or heat shock. We observed a 197 significant upregulation of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 by sodium arsenite or heat shock treatment 198 in H1299 cells; however, there was no reduction of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 by IBV infection 199 (Fig 3D-E) . Collectively, these data indicate that IBV infection restricts both eIF2\u03b1-200 dependent and -independent SG formation, probably by interfering with SG assembly 201 or disassembly and not with direct eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation.

As for coronaviruses, recent studies show that middle east91 respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 4a accessory protein limits the 92 activation of PKR by binding to dsRNA, thereby inhibiting the formation of SGs and 93 ensuring viral protein translation and efficient virus replication [32, 33]. Mouse 94 hepatitis virus (MHV) replication induces host translational shutoff and mRNA decay, 95 with concomitant formation of stress granules and processing bodies [34]. Porcine 96 transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) induced SG like granules correlated with 97 viral replication and transcription [35]. Several SG proteins (including caprin and G3BP) 98 have been reported to be associated with IBV-N protein [36]. A recent report shows 99 that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection results in the formation of SGs in 100 approximately 20% of infected cells and inhibits eIF2\u03b1-dependent/eIF2\u03b1-independent 101 SG formation by unknown mechanisms [37]. 102 Coronaviruses harbor the largest positive-stranded RNA genome among the RNA 103 viruses, with size from 27 kb to 32 kb. The two-third of the 5' terminus encodes 104 replicase polyproteins (1a and 1ab), while one-third of the 3' terminus encodes spike 105 protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N) and 106 accessory proteins. The proteolysis of overlapped polyproteins is processed by two self-107 encoded proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro), into 108 15-16 mature non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16). Most of the nsps assemble into a 109 replication and transcription complex (RTC) responsible for virus replication, while 110 several nsps mediate the evasion of host innate immune responses. For example, severe 111 acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV nsp1 suppresses 112 host gene expression by mediating host mRNA degradation [38]; the PLpro nsp3 of 113 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV harbors deubiquitinase activity and interferes with type I 114 IFN responses [39, 40]; feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FCoV) and porcine 115 deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) nsp5 inhibits type I IFN response by cleaving NEMO [41, the first identified coronavirus in 1930s and infects avian species [45]. It 121 causes a prevalent disease that has led to substantial economic losses in poultry farm 122 for many decades. Elucidating host responses to IBV infection is fundamental to 123 understand virus replication and identify targets for therapeutic control. In this study, 124 we infected three types of cells with IBV, and found that approximately 80% of infected 125 cells did not display SGs formation. IBV also hindered SGs formation triggered by 126 different canonical stress stimuli. Further analysis showed that IBV nsp15 was involved 127 in the inhibition of SG formation, and that the endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 128 particularly played a pivotal role. Compared to wild type IBV, infection with the nsp15 129 endoribonuclease catalytic mutant, rIBV-nsp15-H238A, led to accumulation of higher 130 levels of dsRNA, activation of PKR, and formation SGs, concomitantly with a higher 131 production of IFN-\u03b2 and lower viral replication. We further demonstrate that SGs play 132 an anti-viral role by using SG-defective cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report 133 describing the role of coronavirus nsp15 in the suppression of integral stress response 134 as well as innate antiviral response.135 136",

Sodium arsenite or heat shock 185 promotes phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in an HRI kinase-dependent manner, leading to 186 translational arrest and subsequent formation of SGs [48], whereas NaCl may enhance 187 the local concentration of mRNAs and cellular proteins by decreasing the cell volume, 188 thereby inducing SGs in an eIF2\u03b1-independent manner [49].

We compared the ability of wild type IBV and rIBV-nsp15-H238A to 247 induce the formation of SGs in H1299 and DF-1 cells. At 20 h.p.i., only 18% of H1299 248 cells and 17% of DF-1 cells infected with wild type IBV showed the presence of SGs, 249 whereas approximately 78% of the H1299 cells and 75% of DF-1 cells infected with 250 rIBV-nsp15-H238A showed SGs formation (Fig 6B). Treatment with cycloheximide 251 (CHX), a chemical which disassembles bona fide SGs, dissolved the rIBV-nsp15-252 H238A-induced G3BP1 and G3BP2 granules (Fig 6C), confirming that rIBV-nsp15-253 H238A induces canonical SGs. 254 In agreement, rIBV-nsp15-H238A significantly activated PKR by 255 phosphorylation and in turn phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, while wild type IBV did not (Fig 256 7A). Thus, nsp15 endoribonuclease activity is involved in antagonizing PKR activation, 257 the well characterized dsRNA sensor and IFN-\u03b2 inducer. We noted that the replication 258 of rIBV-nsp15-H238A was impaired, as evidenced by the decreased level of IBV-S, 259 IBV-M, and IBV-N protein synthesis, compared to wild type IBV (Fig 7A). Moreover, 260 although rIBV-nsp15-H238A replication was low, it significantly stimulated the 11 261transcription of IFN-\u03b2 at 20 h.p.i., which was approximately 25-fold higher than that 262 induced by wild type IBV in H1299 cells(Fig 7B, left panel), and approximately 380-263 fold higher than that by wild type IBV in DF-1 cells(Fig 7B, right panel). Taken264 together, the activation of PKR by rIBV-nsp15-H238A and associated induction of type 265 I IFN might be responsible for the lower replication of this recombinant virus. 266 The activation of PKR by rIBV-nsp15-H238A prompted us to measure and 267 compare the levels of dsRNA during infection by using the specific J2 monoclonal 268 antibody, which binds dsRNA greater than 40 nucleotides in length [51] and was 269 previously successfully used during IBV infection in chicken cells [52]. 270 Immunofluorescence analysis at 20 h.p.i., revealed evident accumulation of dsRNA in 271 rIBV-nsp15-H238A infected H1299 cells, compared to wild type IBV infected cells 272 (Fig 7C). The dsRNA produced by rIBV-nsp15-H238A however, did not colocalized 273 with G3BP1 granules, suggesting the dsRNA is not recruited to SGs(Fig 7C). In DF-1 274 cells, we also observed higher levels of dsRNA accumulation during infection with 275 rIBV-nsp15-H238A than with wild type IBV(Fig 7D). dsRNA dot blot analysis also276    supported the observation that infection with rIBV-nsp15-H238A leads to higher 277 accumulation of dsRNA than with wild type IBV (data not shown). Although the 278 dsRNA in wild type IBV infected cells partially co-localized with IBV-N, the dsRNA 279 produced by rIBV-nsp15-H238A did not co-localize well with IBV-N(Fig 7C-D). We 280 speculate that when compared to wild type IBV, rIBV-nsp15-H238A replication leads 281 to higher accumulation of dsRNA and that the excess dsRNA may escape from 282 replication-transcription complex (RTC). The \"free\" dsRNA in turn, triggers the 283 activation of PKR and phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, results in translational shut off, 284 eventually promoting the formation of SGs and activation of the type I IFN response.",

Altogether, these data indicate that intact 289 nsp15 endoribonuclease activity acts to reduce the intracellular levels of dsRNA, defective rIBV-nsp15-H238A strongly activates the IRF3-IFN signaling via 293 the formation of SG294    To examine the role of SGs in IBV infection, we knocked out the SGs core protein 295 G3BP1 and G3BP2 in H1299 cells by a CRISPR-Cas9 approach. Depletion of G3BP1/2 296 resulted in the absence of SGs during sodium arsenite stimulation and rIBV-nsp15-297 H238A infection(Fig 8A). In G3BP1/2 knock out cells, the levels of phospho-TBK1 298 and phospho-IRF3 triggered by rIBV-nsp15-H238A infection were greatly decreased 299 (Fig 8B); consequently, the transcription of IFN-\u03b2 and ISG IFIT1 induced by rIBV-300 nsp15-H238A infection were decreased (Fig 8C). These results suggest that the 301 formation of SGs is necessary to elicit IRF3-IFN signaling in response to rIBV-nsp15-302 H238A infection. It was worth noting that rIBV-nsp15-H238A infection did not 303 significantly stimulate p65 phosphorylation, and knock out of G3BP1/2 had no obvious 304 effect on phospho-p65 levels (Fig 8B); thus, SGs formation is not involved in NF-\u03baB 305 signaling during IBV infection. Interestingly, upon G3BP1/2 knock out, we observed 306 higher levels of IBV-S, IBV-M, and IBV-N (Fig 8B)and in agreement, more infectious 307 progeny virus particles were produced, as evidenced by TCID 50 assay(Fig 8D). This is 308 in line with our previous suggestion that activation of the type I IFN signaling might be 309 the factor limiting rIBV-nsp15-H238A replication; failure to trigger an IFN-\u03b2 response 310 in G3BP1/2 knock out cells however, promotes virus replication even in the absence of 311 nsp15 endoribonuclease activity.312To investigate whether the involvement of SGs in IRF3-IFN signaling is restricted 313 to specific virus infections, we examined the IRF3-IFN signaling upon poly I:C 314 stimulation. Results showed that in G3BP1/2 positive cells, poly I:C strongly stimulated 315 phosphorylation of IRF3 and to a lesser extent of TBK1(Fig 9A), and promoted IRF3 316 nuclear translocation(Fig 9B, 34%of total cells display nuclear IRF3); however, in the 317 absence of G3BP1/2, poly I:C stimulation led to reduced TBK1 phosphorylation, and 318 to a greater extent, to reduced IRF3 phosphorylation(Fig 9A), as well as less IRF313 319 nuclear translation (Fig 9B, 9% of total cells with nuclear IRF3). As a consequence, 320 transcription of IFN-\u03b2 and IFIT-1 was significantly decreased upon poly I:PRRs and signaling intermediates to SGs during IBV infection 326 A previous report showed that the dsRNA sensors PKR, MDA5, and RIG-I are 327 located to SG and sense dsRNA [24]. In this study, we examined the subcellular 328 localization of PRRs and signaling intermediates during IBV infection. In the small 329 proportion of IBV-infected cells that displayed the presence of SGs, PKR, MDA5, 330 TLR3 and MAVS aggregated and colocalized with G3BP1 granules (Fig 10A). These 331 results demonstrate that SGs indeed recruit PRRs and their signaling intermediates 332 during IBV infection. We further examined the subcellular location of signaling 333 intermediates, results showed that TRAF3, TRAF6, TBK1, and IKK\u03b5 all aggregated to 334 G3BP1 granules (Fig 10B). These data, combined with the positive role on IRF3-IFN 335 signaling, demonstrate that SGs may function as a platform for PRRs and downstream 336 signaling intermediates.",

Furthermore, consistent with previous 346 reports [53], also in our study we found that IBV inhibits both eIF2\u03b1-dependent (heat 347 shock, sodium arsenite) and -independent (NaCl) SGs formation.

The negative strand RNAs 369 is the replication intermediate of genomic RNA and of sub-genomic RNA. During the 370 replication and transcription process, positive and negative strand RNA form dsRNA. 371 It has been reported that nsp13 and cellular helicases help to unwind the dsRNA for 372 efficient replication and transcription. The amount of negative strand intermediates is 373 approximately 10% of the positive strand RNA [59]. It is believed that the proper ratio 374 of positive and negative stand RNA is important for efficient replication and 375 transcription, as well as subsequent genome packaging and mRNA translation.

As the negative strand RNA intermediates 382 harbor a poly (U) sequence, which is complementary to the positive strand RNA poly 383 (A) tail, we propose that nsp15 targets negative strand intermediates or dsRNA 384 intermediates within stalled RTCs that are no longer active in viral RNA synthesis. This 385 is supported by the observation that, compared to wild type IBV, infection with nsp15-386 null virus rIBV-nsp15-H238A leads to substantial accumulation of dsRNA 387 intermediates that do not localize with RTCs and to an increased ratio of negative 388 strand:positive strand RNA .

It is likely that dsRNAs are 403 shielded within double-membrane vesicles and replication intermediates are likely 404 protected by the RTC and N protein. In this study, by generating nsp15-defective 405 recombinant virus, we find that compared to the wild type virus, infection with rIBV-406 nsp15-H238A leads to dsRNA accumulation, PKR activation, robust formation of SG 407 as well as up-regulation of IFN-\u03b2, which ultimately coincided with impaired rIBV-408 nsp15-H238A replication. Therefore, IBV nsp15 acts as IFN antagonist, likely through 409 removal of dsRNA intermediates at sites of RNA synthesis, thereby efficiently evading 410 integrated stress and innate anti-viral host responses. The involvement of the viral 411 ribonuclease in degrading viral dsRNA and antagonizing IFN responses has also been 412 reported in pestivirus and Lassa virus [68-70]. 413 Several reports show that SGs serve as platform for viral dsRNA sensing by RLRs 414 and subsequent activation of viral immune responses [71, 72]. Recent studies reported 415 that several other IFN regulatory molecules, such as MEX3C, Riplet, DHX36 and 416 Pumilios, also localize to SGs [73]. It is thus reasonable that viruses evolved 417 mechanisms to suppress SGs formation in order to promote their propagation. Influenza 418 A virus (IAV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is reported to be involved in subversion 419 of PKR-dependent SG formation [25]; importantly, during NS1-null IAV infection, 420 viral RNAs and nucleocapsid protein co-localize in SGs together with RIG-I, PKR and 421 SGs markers G3BP1/TIAR; knock down of the G3BP1 or PKR genes abrogated NS1-422 null IAV-induced IFN production, concomitantly with defects in SGs formation. Here, 423 we find that wild type IBV triggers the formation of SGs only in 20% infected cells, 424 and that PRRs (PKR, MDA5, TLR3) and signaling intermediates (MAVS, TRAF3, 17 425 TRAF6, TBK1, IKK\u03b5) aggregate to the IBV-induced SGs. Nsp15-null recombinant 426 IBV robustly activates PKR, efficiently induces SGs formation (80% infected cells with 427 SGs formation), and strongly induced the transcription of IFN-\u03b2; but in SGs' core 428 proteins defective cells, either by nsp15-null recombinant IBV infection or poly I:C 429 stimulation, the induction of IFN-\u03b2 signaling is severely impaired. These data thus 430 further confirm that SGs play a positive regulatory role in the IRF3-IFN signaling, 431 leading to the initiation of anti-viral innate responses, and that this is not restricted to a 432 specific virus infection. These observations strongly suggest that the formation of SGs 433 is critical for virus-induced antiviral innate immunity and SGs may function as a 434 scaffold for viral RNA recognition by RLRs.",

Thus, the ribonuclease is 440 a unique strategy for viruses to subvert SGs. It has been well characterized that the 441 herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV2 employ the virion host shutoff (VHS) 442 endoribonuclease to impede the SGs formation [74, 75]. Infection with a mutant virus 443 lacking VHS (\u0394VHS) results in PKR activation and PKR-dependent SGs formation in 444 multiple cell types [76, 77]. Destabilization of host mRNAs by VHS may directly 445 contribute to its disruption of SG formation [78]. In addition to be important in virus 446 replication, coronavirus nsp15 may also target host mRNA and subsequently inhibit 447 host protein translation. Interestingly, we previously showed that differently from 448 alphacoronaviruses such as MHV and SARS-CoV [79, 80], wild-type IBV affects host 449 protein synthesis leading to host-protein shut off, but without affecting mRNA stability450",

The requirement for 458 nsp15 endoribonuclease activity for the disruption of both eIF2\u03b1-dependent or eIF2\u03b1-459 independent SGs, implies that removal of mRNA from SGs promotes their disassembly 460 and predicts that intact RNA is crucial for maintaining the integrity of SGs; (2) during 461 IBV infection, nsp15 endoribonuclease activity may be involved in the regulation of 462 virus genomic RNA replication and sub-genomic mRNA transcription, consequently 463 functioning as a \"gatekeeper\" to sequester viral dsRNA within replication complexes 464 and away from host sensor PKR, resulting in absence of SG formation; (3) nsp15 465 prevents the assembly of SGs by promoting the destruction of mRNAs present in 466 polysome, free mRNA, or by blocking the processing of pre-mRNA and nuclear export 467 of mRNA, thus preventing a crucial step in SGs assembly pathway. Our unpublished 468 data show that nsp15 interferes with the host protein translation and retains poly(A) 469 binding protein 1 (PABP1) in the nucleus, and that the endoribonuclease activity is 470 specifically required for this function. Thus, nsp15 probably also targets host mRNA to 471 prevent SGs assembly. As the nsp15 endoribonuclease is conserved, we speculate that 472 coronaviruses employ similar mechanisms to antagonize the host anti-viral SGs 473 formation for efficient virus proliferation. Altogether, this study is the first to 474 demonstrated that IBV coronavirus antagonize the formation of antiviral hubs SGs 475 through the activity of its endoribonuclease nsp15, and that this is required for efficient 476 virus proliferation.",

The working model of inhibition of anti-viral stress granule formation by 814 infectious bronchitis virus nsp15. 1) IBV genome replication and mRNA 815 transcription produce dsRNA. Nsp15 functions to cleave viral dsRNA and reduce its 816 accumulation. Thus, virus avoids activation of PKR and impedes SGs formation. 2) 817 Absence of nsp15 endoribonuclease activity in rIBV-nsp15-H238A, results in the 818 accumulation of viral dsRNA, activation of PKR, and subsequent formation of SGs. 819 The aggregation of PRRs and signaling intermediates to SGs facilitates the signaling 820 transduction and IRF3 activation, finally inducing the expression of IFN-\u03b2. Production 821 of IFN-\u03b2 in turn, effectively limits rIBV-nsp15-H238A proliferation. 3) In parallel, 822nsp15 may also cleave host mRNA or interfere with host mRNA nuclear export or 823 processing thereby preventing the assembly of SGs or promoting their disassembly.",

To elucidate the inhibition mechanism of SG formation by IBV, we investigated 166 whether IBV interfered with the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2\u03b1 or directly affected TIA-1 and G3BP1 protein levels.
