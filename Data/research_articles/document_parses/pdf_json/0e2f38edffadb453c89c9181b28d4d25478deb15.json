There was an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government \"declared war against disease\" around 11/12.03.20 with a massive mitigation program. Later on, there was a decay in interest with additional phases related to social distancing and an anti-crisis legislation act with local peaks. We have found that declarations of mitigation strategies by the Polish prime minister or the minister of health gathered the highest attention of Internet users. So enacted or in force events do not affect interest to such extent. Traditional news agencies were ahead of social media (mainly Twitter) in dissemination of information. We have observed very weak or even negative correlations between a colloquial searching term 'antiviral mask' in Google, encyclopaedic definition in Wikipedia \"SARS-CoV-2\" as well official incidence series, implying different mechanisms governing the search for knowledge, panic related behaviour and actual risk of acquiring infection.",

For instance, on average people believe that negative events such as infection and death are less likely to happen to them than to others (5) . In the previous epidemics (A/H1N1, SARS, Ebola) in the Internet era societies (such as Polish (6)) experienced quite similar phases of interest starting from fear, then moving to practical issues such as prevention and finishing with scapegoating (7) . Recently media activities are being analysed worldwide to better understand perception and spread of diseases (8) as COVID-19 (9) . Social media can serve as a valuable source of information as well as disinformation about the virus globally, fuelling panic and creating socalled infodemics (10) , at unprecedented speed. Propaganda and persuasion techniques are widely used on the Internet, easily reaching certain target groups susceptible to conspiracy theories and effectively polarizing societies (9, 11) . Panic-related behaviours accompanying a virus outbreak (7) are influencing the epidemic spread, with the Internet being the main mediating mechanism. This could lead to destructive collective behaviour, such as e.g. xenophobia against people from affected countries (12) . Moreover, infodemiology and infoveillance (10) should be employed for standard surveillance purposes within the emerging field of \"digital epidemiology\" and in the area of public health.",

Tracking \"digital footprints\" of Internet users brings understanding of customers' behavior and preferences on a large scale in the commercial and scientific sectors. Up to our knowledge there were no previous studies quantitatively linking the Internet activities and perception of infectious diseases in Poland (13, 14) , except for our own studies (15, 16) and some straightforward attempts such as correlating the incidence of influenza with Google Trends (8) . Moreover, during the first few weeks of COVID-19 pandemic a tremendous amount of studies appeared targeting English and Asian languages (17) with an underrepresentation of European countries. Thus the present study is a first exploratory attempt filling this gap and continuing a preliminary research on \"Koronawirus\" perception in Poland before disease introduction (15) representing a more general approach highlighting the role of social sciences during COVID-19 pandemic (16) in public health.

Moreover, discussions on social-content media (YouTube and Wikipedia) demonstrate smoother interest trajectories (Fig. 4 ) than information providers (news from EventRegistry, Google). We detected time lags between different platforms for given topics (e.g. traditional news media are ahead of commentary media in the case of fake news on a possible disease introduction) in phases 1-4 (Fig. 5) . It could imply that social media disseminate information via word-of-mouth spreading mechanisms. On the other hand, traditional media have journalists hired to search and select most interesting topics quickly (29) . It leads to faster response to events by news agencies (represented by EventRegistry) than social media. The strongest lag (1 day) is observed between EventRegistry (the most ahead of) and Twitter (the most delayed) (Fig. 5) . We detected time lags between official SARS-CoV-2 incidence and risk perception. For instance interest in protective masks ahead incidence 3 days before. On the other hand increase in incidence can be linked with decrease of \"Koronawirus\" search in Google 6 days later [ Fig. 6 ].",

To quantify the similarity in interest on different platforms we calculated Pearson correlations coefficients of the time series (Fig. 7) . Additionally, the popularity of terms related to COVID-19 were also investigated. Due to limitations imposed by the Editorial Board they are presented in the APPENDIX. The majority of measured terms are positively correlated. Protective mask as a signal of fear/perception of risk is less correlated with other variables, more related to information needs. Protective mask and washing hands pair is much less correlated than protective mask and hand disinfection pair, which could mean that people search for professional solutions rather than simple and practical ones. Moreover, high amounts of search queries such as antiviral mask (there is no such medical term) implies that people are searching protection measures defined in non-professional terms (15) . Official COVID-19 incidence correlates only weakly positively or even negatively (Fig. 6) with measured interest value so risk perception in Poland is significantly unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring infections, which is contradictory to the situation in some other countries (28) .",

After the \"definition need phase 1-2\" people seem to be more interested mainly in the update (news information on COVID-19) on Twitter, YouTube or other electronic media. This has covered the phase, which might be called \"norms need phase 4-5\", because in this time the most searched topics were protection measures and mitigation behaviors. That is the reason that anti-crisis shield issues gathered more interest in information related media (Google, news article) as well as on politically oriented Twitter than on other social media. 4) The focus on social activity posed in this study revealed trends in common understanding of selfprotective measures.

Our analysis showed that Poles looked for professional (or quasi-professional) measures of self-protection: \"antiviral mask\" or \"hand disinfection\" (instead simple \"washing hands\") . We were able to identify at least few misinformation, cognitive errors or fake news, which significantly impact interest on \"Koronawirus\" topic in Poland. They fall on fertile ground, due to the script mechanism of simplifying reality, where simpler explanations are more easily absorbed by people (11) . Especially since epidemiologists and public health professionals do not know enough about COVID-19 yet, and recommendations and opinions of authorities such as WHO or Ministry of Health are still being updated and often being contradictory to previous opinions (e.g. effectiveness of protective mask) causing cognitive dissonance in the public. As a good example we may take the popularity of a product, which does not exist on the medical market such as an \"antiviral mask\" (see Appendix). We show that scientifically confirmed and effective infection control strategies such as keeping high hygienic standards are not popular among Internet users and pseudo-professional solutions are much more attractive until official recommendations are introduced (Fig. 7) . 5) Low interest of the general public in COVID-19 before the disease introduction could be associated with a low epidemiological awareness of average Poles, especially when COVID-19 pandemic is massively discussed in traditional and social media by a relatively small but loud group of people (16) . It's worth to mention, that a positive effect of interest in \"Koronawirus\" could be a probable increase in epidemiological and hygienic knowledge in Polish population which is probably below European average (even health literacy for non-infectious diseases does not differ significantly in comparison to other European countries (21).",
