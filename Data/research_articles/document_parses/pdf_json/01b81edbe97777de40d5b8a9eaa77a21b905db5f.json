And as for parasites, Low et al. suggest taking advantage of a relatively-unknown organelle: the apicoplast, the exclusive property of Apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium. This specificity plus the prokaryotic features of the plastid make it an interesting target for drugs. As there is still no efficient vaccine against malaria, the authors recommend that we turn our attention to the plastid. Interestingly, many drugs affecting the apicoplast lead to a \"delayed death\" phenomenon, where only the second generation of parasites die -theoretically, the ideal conditions for the development for a so-called \"suicide vaccine\" [5] .",

And even when the complexity of the pathogen world is narrowed down to \"only\" the influenza A virus (IAV), things stay pretty convoluted, as Downey et al. point out in their review. They emphasize the importance of using in vivo models rather than cell cultures because communication between pulmonary macrophages and epithelial cells shape the kinetics of cell death during infection, which are in turn crucial for regulating the antiviral responses [7] . This view is supported by Brizic et al., who describe insights on the neurological damage caused by the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gained from a mouse model [8] . But even when down to one receptor, complexity has still the final say. In this research paper in our collection of reviews, the group of Ojcius unravels the versatile role of the mitochondrial NOD-like receptor NLRX1 in the modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome: it activates the NLRP3 inflammasome upon infection by pathogens but can dampen its effects in the presence of mere commensal pathogens [9] .",

Pathogens live in a constantly changing and mostly hostile environment, where resourcefulness and rapid adaptation are core requirements for survival. Hence, a mixed population is best suited to face sudden challenges. For that matter, another profound dogma change of the past decades has been the rehabilitation of \"junk DNA\" and \"noise\" thanks to the discovery of a huge number of long noncoding RNAs and pervasive transcription. Just as the latter is now considered raw material for evolution and adaptation, stochastic fluctuations in gene expression, exacerbated in turn by slight differences in the microenvironment and feedback loops, drive the emergence of subpopulations in a genetically identical population and can be considered a virulence strategy [14] .",

            "text": "Close observation of the different stages of pathogenesis is pivotal for improved therapy, state Rajasagi and Rouse in their review on herpes stromal keratitits (SK). The authors describe how classical treatment strategies mainly based on anti-viral drugs and corticosteroids could be enriched by lipid pre-resolving mediators, anti-angiogenic agents or manipulation of microRNAs and metabolism [20] . A similar logic underlies the review by Vernel-Pauillac and Werts, who combine the latest insights into how Leptospira interrogans escapes the immune system with the most recent tactics for drug and vaccine development. Notably, the authors explain how computational and statistical approaches as well as the CRISPR/Cas9 technology could assist vaccine design [21] . The team of Oliveiro reminds us that sometimes the foe can become a friend, at least in bits and pieces. They make a good case for the use of serine protease inhibitors containing a Kunitz domain normally used by helminth parasites to dampen the host immune system, but which could come in very handy when the latter goes over the top [22] . In turn, Olds et al. plead for the revival of an \"ancient universal stress molecule\" -abscisic acid (ABA). The versatile stress signalling molecule in plants and animals seems indeed to have many applications: being essential for T. gondii growth and development, it might be a therapeutic target; in mammals, the hormone has displayed beneficial properties in a wide range of processes, including glucose metabolism, stem cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, inflammation and depression [23] .",
