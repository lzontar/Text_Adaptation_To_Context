These differing sojourns and the survival of particles in aerosols have been better elucidated recently by new technology and help explain their capricious nature as effective vectors of infectious agents [6] [7] [8] [9] . Of prime importance are the size of the particle, usually described as the particle's aerodynamic equivalent diameter (AED), and its settling velocity. Particles of large AED settle quickly and, thus, are hazards primarily to those in close vicinity to an infected person. On the other hand, small particles are likely to remain airborne and destined for further spread [7, 8] . For example, particles with AEDs of 100 have settling times of 6.7 s, compared with 18.5 h for particles with an AED of 1. Furthermore, the size of the particles may, to a large extent, dictate the likelihood of infection occurring and the site of infection [6, 7, 9] . Although the concentration of infectious particles in airborne aerosols usually is low, these small particles are likely to result in lower respiratory tract disease, whereas larger particles are more apt to settle in the upper respiratory tract, often resulting in milder disease and longer incubation periods.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 172, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 173, "end": 175, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 383, "end": 386, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 387, "end": 390, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 391, "end": 394, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 395, "end": 398, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 771, "end": 774, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 775, "end": 777, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1041, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1044, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1047, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 168, "text": "(table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "THE SPREAD OF VIRUSES SHED"}, {"text": "These properties of viral agents and environmental condi- tions are constantly changing, making determination of the primary mode of transmission at any one time difficult.

Some organisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, however, require settling in the lower respiratory tract for infection to occur [6, 8] . Environmental conditions also affect whether a virus, once propelled by coughing or sneezing, will remain stable and viable during its journey to a susceptible host. Viruses generally survive better on hard surfaces than on porous surfaces or hands. RSV remains infectious on counter tops for \u04406 h, but it remains so for 20-30 min on gowns or paper tissues and for !20 min on skin; this is sufficient to cause infection when contaminated hands touch the eyes or nose [10] .

Among the many proposed procedures for infection control, hand cleansing has been perhaps the only one that is not controversial. Recognition of the pivotal role of clean hands for the control of infections may be credited to Ignaz Semmelweis. In the 1840s, he observed that fewer puerperal infections occurred in his obstetrical clinic in Vienna when he required physicians to clean their hands with a chlorine-containing solution between visits with patients. Despite the recognized importance of hand cleansing in diminishing nosocomial infections, compliance with hand hygiene procedures by health care personnel is singularly poor [36] [37] [38] . This situation may be improved by the recent recommendation for the preferential use of alcohol-based hand-sanitizing products [36] . This recommendation is based on the fact that their efficacy is greater than that for soap-and-water washing in reducing the number of organisms on the skin, on the low occurrence of adverse effects, and on the resulting increased compliance by health care workers. Although use of hand sanitizers has been correlated with diminished occurrence of nosocomial infections in general, evidence that they decrease the spread of and illness associated with specific viruses is limited. Alcohol-containing products have been demonstrated in vitro to have greater efficacy against enveloped respiratory viruses than against nonenveloped viruses, including picornaviruses, parechoviruses, adenoviruses, and rotavirus.

Experimental and clinical observations may not always concur. Thus, development of infection-control policies that are strictly evidence based is difficult, if not impossible. However, a practical and tenable conclusion is that an effective infection-control program depends not as much on the inclusion of procedures tailored to specific pathogens as on the incorporation of procedures that enhance compliance and awareness of the risks of nosocomial infection for both patients and personnel. Recommended infection-control procedures should be convenient, consistent, pragmatic, and publicized.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Masks"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Prevention and control of airborne infection in the community", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Riley", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1980, "venue": "Ann NY Acad Sci", "volume": "353", "issn": "", "pages": "331--340", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Infection by air: sources and modes of infection", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": ["V"], "last": "Chapin", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1910, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Changing concepts of airborne infection of acute contagious diseases: a reconsideration of classic epidemiologic theories", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Langmuir", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1980, "venue": "Ann NY Acad Sci", "volume": "353", "issn": "", "pages": "35--44", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Guidelines for isolation precautions in hospitals.
