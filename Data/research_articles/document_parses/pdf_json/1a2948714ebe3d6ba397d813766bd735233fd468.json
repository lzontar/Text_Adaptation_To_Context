Therefore, numerous national societies have warned against splitting ventilators to support multiple patients. 9 In order to safely ventilate multiple patients, systems must allow individualized control of patients' tidal volumes and ensure changes in one patient do not affect the other. We present a solution affording patient-specific peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) adjustment for multiple patients using a single ventilator. During the preparation of this manuscript, we became aware of the Pressure-Regulated Ventilator Splitting (PReVentS) group solution 10 , which tackles some of these issues; similarities and differences are discussed.",

Critically, the regulators have adjustable diaphragms set relative to atmospheric pressure such that the pressure for each patient is fixed; adjustments to inspiratory pressure on the ventilator do not affect delivered PIP. Thus, airway pressures (and consequently tidal volumes) are independently modulated for each patient independently of one another.

Allowing the inspiratory pressure to be independently modified may permit two or more patients to be connected to a single ventilator without depending on matching of patients' lung compliances and sizes. Through controlling the pressure in each circuit, appropriate tidal volumes can be achieved while lung compliance varies between patients and/or changes over time (e.g., with developing acute respiratory distress syndrome).",

In addition, we only tested the adjustment and regulation of inspiratory pressure in relation to tidal volume. While individualized PEEP was not the focus of this test, expiratory limb 4116ANNKE regulators (manufacturer, location) could achieve individual PEEP control. The PReVentS preprint discloses pressure-regulating valves on both the inspiratory and expiratory limbs to adjust PIP and PEEP. In their system, a pressure difference within the circuit will rise and fall with varying input pressures. However, it may be advantageous to use regulators that allow a fixed absolute pressure setting relative to atmosphere, which does not change as other parameters are modified. Post-market modification of valves from AMBU bags (manufacturer, location) may be more susceptible to failure during use compared to our use of commercial pressure regulators (produced under ISO standards).",

            "text": "). The PIP of each simulated lung was controlled by a 4116ANNKE Fairchild Pneumatic Precision Low Pressure Regulator (manufacturer, location), and a pressure gauge was attached to the end of each inspiratory limb upstream of each simulated patient. This pressure regulator has a sensitivity of 0.127 cm H 2 O control. Connectors to the pressure regulator (at the inlet and outlet) were 3D-printed with biocompatible Stratasys MED610 (manufacturer, location). Inspiratory HEPA filters (model, manufacturer, location) were placed proximal to the lungs to eliminate potential mixing of contaminated expiratory gas between patients. The ventilator was programmed in pressure-control mode with inspiratory pressure of 40-50 mm Hg to ensure that sufficient pressures entered each regulator. Inspiratory time was set at 1 s and positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH 2 O. A Respironics NICO2 (model 7600, manufacturer, location) in-line sampler was used to obtain lung volume and pressure measurements. The test lungs (Ingmar Medical Quick Lung, manufacturer, location) were set to a compliance of 20 mL cm H 2 O -1 during. To ensure safety for a dual-patient system, it is necessary to verify that (a) the regulator settings are maintained under different operating conditions within one circuit and (b) changes in one lung circuit do not affect the other. To verify (a), we measured PIP as the same-circuit lung compliance was varied. To verify (b), we sampled lung pressure and tidal volume in one lung circuit while varying the pressure in the other circuit. In both tests, lung 2 parameters were measured. For (a), we varied the compliance of lung 2 with a fixed regulator PIP setting of 25 cm H 2 O. As compliance was reduced in the test lung, the observed pressure remained fixed at 25 cmH2O, while the tidal volume decreased accordingly.",
