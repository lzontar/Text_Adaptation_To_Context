Taiwan has so far managed to prevent a large scale community outbreak, city forces wearing face masks on public transportation, and keep social distancing to stem the virus from spreading. The protective device may be contaminated and must be replaced. In the situation of limited resources, how to take care of the physiological needs of the doctor without increasing the chance of contamination during replacement is a consideration. By reducing the chance of contamination during removal and storage, the previous designs were analyzed and improved. We proposed three improved designs to reduce the contact. Design-A features a mask with a water channel that allows the user to remain hydrated without removing the cover. Design-B has a folding pattern that hides the outer surface. Design-C combines the mask with the brim of a cap which form an extended air-intake area. Through understanding the problem, related product began distribute on the market, Design-D extend the mask usages period with less contact.",

            "text": "This paper proposes three mask improvement designs for both general users and hospital staff to reduce the chance of face mask contact transmission. Influenza virus infection occurs through contact transmission between people. Infectious diseases can spread through droplets, respiratory aerosols, or direct and indirect contact with contaminated surfaces. The effectiveness of face masks in disease prevention has been verified through research. 1 MacIntyre et al. examined the effect of surgical masks and handwashing on the prevention of influenza transmission. 2 Public compliance with infection control measures is crucial. If a large number of people use masks during a severe pandemic, the spread of the epidemic is reduced. Reducing exposure can reduce the spread of disease in public places such as schools. Cauchemez et al. 3 have shown that holidays lead to a 20-29% reduction in the rate at which influenza is transmitted to children in school. Face mask comfort is a key to public compliance with infection control measures. In a survey by Purdy, 4 participants were asked to use a Likert scale of 1-6 to assess the N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) based on fitness, temperature, and respiratory comfort. 4 In terms of discomfort, warmth, and breathing comfort, fitness was rated the most important, and two-dimensional patterns expanded the mask area to cover the facial contours for individuals.",

            "text": "Several variations on the standard surgical face mask are currently offered by companies. Halyard health face masks offer several features and levels of protection. The materials and donning attachments are sonically bonded, and a nose piece assists the mask in conforming to the contours of the face (Figure 1 ). Most surgical face masks contain an adjustable iron wire which is bent with finger pressure to fix its shape close to the bridge of the nose. This one-dimensional fixation creates a gap when the mask moves. Figure 1a also shows an adjustable nose bridge design that maintains a closer fit to the user's face. Three charging techniques (viz., corona charging, tribocharging, and electrostatic fiber spinning) were used to charge fibers or fabrics of different polymer types. 11 Electrostatic charging technology enables regular masks to filter more air particles. Figure 1b shows an extended surgical mask designed with respiratory comfort concerns in mind. A flat-fold design protects against airborne biological particles and serves as a respirator. The three-panel, low-profile N95 particulate respirator mask features a soft cover and nose clip. The mask is opened by pulling up and down, and closed in the opposite way. However, although it is folded vertically, the front outer surface is still touchable during donning and doffing. Many existing product designs are based on considerations of filtering performance and suitability for individual face shapes. Figure 1c is a design with an elongated elastic restraint. A three-dimensional mask increases the protection of the mask and is convenient to carry. 13 Figure 1d shows the upper section and the lower sections are respectively lifted away from the middle to form a three-dimensional shape. The sheet is bent along the first fold line and toward the opposite surface to facilitate carrying. The packaging of the Snack face mask is easily opened for fast use (Figure 1e ). The packaging is part of the mask, so it does not come into contact with the outside world when it is folded. Although there are different folding methods for each design, there is no product that can avoid outer layer contact completely.",

The design flow is, firstly, i) we look for problems and available materials, ii) we observe the medical characteristics through a simplified model, and iii) we try to find appropriate implement way. Secondly, concept drawings provided by the design group and screened based on producibility. In a medical design, the designer needs to extend his knowledge through international regulations such as ISO, MDR and FDA. The MDR sets high standards for ensuring reliable data are generated from clinical investigations. 22 Recently, FDA recommendation on device reuse, so that developing cost-effective reusable face masks for the public is essential. The 510(k) submission of surgical mask evaluates medical devices for marketing to ensure they are safe and effective. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, microwave-generated steaming, and dry heating were tested in reducing or inactivating viral and bacterial pathogens. 23 A costeffective full-face mask was developed to support safety of stuff. 24 In this urgent need of the epidemic, it also urged the creation of improved mask design. Designers can develop concepts firmly and realize ideas through cross-domain cooperation.",

The creative rules applied are: Reverse-drink water without taking off your mask; Transfer-transfer the Pet cap to the mask; Extension-drink water with an extension straw. Medical staff can drink water safely and conveniently without removing their masks. A water bag will engage the inlet on the front of the cover ( Figure  2 ).
