Methods In this retrospective study, 76 COVID-19 patients who underwent abdominal CT for abdominal complaints from March 1 to April 15, 2020, in a large urban multihospital Health System were included. Those with positive abdominal CT findings (n = 14) were then excluded, with 62 patients undergoing final analysis (30M/32F; median age 63 years, interquartile range (IQR) 52-75 years, range 30-90 years). Demographic and clinical data were extracted. CT lung base assessment was performed by a cardiothoracic radiologist. Data were compared between discharged and hospitalised patients using Wilcoxon or Fisher's exact tests. Results The majority of the population was non-elderly (56.4%, < 65 years) and most (81%) had underlying health conditions. Nineteen percent were discharged and 81% were hospitalised. The most frequent abdominal symptoms were pain (83.9%) and nausea/vomiting/anorexia (46.8%). Lung base CT findings included ground-glass opacities (95.2%) in a multifocal (95.2%) and peripheral (66.1%) distribution. Elevated laboratory values (when available) included C-reactive protein (CRP) (97.3%), Ddimer (79.4%), and ferritin (68.8% of males and 81.8% of females). Older age (p = 0.045), hypertension (p = 0.019), and lower haemoglobin in women (p = 0.042) were more frequent in hospitalised patients.

SARS-CoV-2, transmitted between symptomatic and asymptomatic humans through respiratory droplets and direct contact, can result in severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan failure [2] . Coronavirus disease 2019 , the term for the clinical illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, has placed immense stress on the global healthcare apparatus and has resulted in profound economic disruption. As of 2 June 2020, there have been approximately 6 million confirmed cases and 371,000 deaths worldwide, with an estimated $2.7 trillion in global economic losses [3, 4] . Approximately 1.9 million of those cases and 107,000 of those deaths are within the USA, with 372,000 cases and 24,000 deaths within New York State [3] . Currently, there is no specific anti-viral therapy or vaccine available for COVID -19. Although typically characterised by fever and respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) and/or genitourinary (GU) complaints as an initial presentation of COVID-19 have recently been described, albeit to a lesser extent [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . In a metaanalysis of 69 studies including 4302 COVID-19 patients in Asia, 17.6% of patients reported GI symptoms [11] . Viral RNA was detected in stool samples from 48.1% of these patients [11] . A multicentre study from China with 204 patients showed that 50.5% reported GI symptoms on presentation [12] . Interestingly, and as we have observed clinically within our major multihospital Health System in New York City (NYC), many COVID-19 patients present with abdominal symptoms either in isolation or in combination with respiratory complaints. These patients commonly undergo computed tomography (CT), with incidental findings of peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and/or consolidative opacities noted at the lung bases, which have been described in the setting of COVID-19 [13] [14] [15] [16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 222, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 441, "end": 444, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 804, "end": 807, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 808, "end": 810, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 961, "end": 964, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1053, "text": "-19.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1279, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1283, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1287, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1288, "end": 1291, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1295, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1300, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1420, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1492, "end": 1496, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1607, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2087, "end": 2091, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2092, "end": 2096, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2097, "end": 2101, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2106, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Data is rapidly emerging given the novel nature of this devastating disease, with a paucity of published reports investigating abdominal presenting symptoms and subsequent CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients.

Axial CT of the lung bases at two different levels (a, b) shows predominantly peripheral, multifocal, and bilateral ground-glass (white arrows) and consolidative (black arrows) opacities with a region of 'crazy paving' attenuation (dashed arrow), a less commonly seen imaging finding in COVID-19. This patient was discharged home after being hospitalised for 8 days with GI symptoms and diarrhoea reported with high frequency (23-70%) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and in > 33% of patients with Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) [36] [37] [38] . A recent preliminary, non-peer-reviewed study also suggested that ACE2 is also expressed in cholangiocytes, perhaps providing a mechanism for liver dysfunction and elevated serum liver enzymes [39] . Of note, there was mild elevation in serum AST in our study. The renal and urinary bladder expression of ACE2 may explain the urinary symptoms in our study sample.
