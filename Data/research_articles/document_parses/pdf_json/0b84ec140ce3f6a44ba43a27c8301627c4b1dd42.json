Student patrons of a university cafeteria were observed during lunch. Across several phases, researchers observed and recorded the number of students (a) entering the restroom to wash hands and (b) using a hand-sanitizer gel. Interventions included an informational poster, hand-sanitizer dispenser, and change agent to increase hand-hygiene behavior. Results showed that the presence of a strategically placed hand-sanitizer dispenser was effective in increasing hand-hygiene behavior from 1.52% to over 60% (average n = 208 students per day). Participants were particularly responsive to the hand-sanitizer dispenser when combined with a change agent. Meanwhile, the tested interventions were ineffective in increasing the number of students entering a restroom to hand wash. The results are discussed regarding response cost and socially-mediated consequences of change agents.",

In fact, investigators have shown through modeling strategies that nursing staff using hand sanitizer exclusively would save time without sacrificing the quality of patient care (Voss & Widmer, 1997) . This research suggests that 100% hand-washing compliance by nurses would take 17% of their total working time (Voss & Widmer, 1997; Widmer, 2000) . In contrast, nurses that switched to using hand-sanitizer gels would take < 3% of their total working time. The inclusion of hand-sanitizer gels, as part of the hand-hygiene definition, underscores the behavioral importance of hand sanitizer's ease and accessibility of use sufficient for improving and maintaining hand-hygiene practices.",

            "text": "Our research began with a pilot study attempting to approximate natural frequency of hand washing of students prior to eating their lunch at a college cafeteria. Researchers made 4,144 observations over 20 days, observing individual students from the time they entered the cafeteria until they began eating their food. These pilot observations revealed that the baseline frequency of students entering a restroom to hand wash demonstrated a floor effect. During the pilot observations interventions were implemented, including an (a) informational poster, and (b) informational leaflet 2 handed out by a female student serving as a change agent. Both the poster and leaflet provided information about pathogen risk and encouraged hand washing. However, during the intervention phases, the number of students observed entering the restroom to hand wash did not change. Interestingly, the behavior change techniques used in our pilot research have been previously shown to influence student hand hygiene (e.g., Surgeoner, Chapman, & Powell, 2009) , the hand hygiene of food preparation staff (e.g., Geller, Eason, Phillips, & Pierson, 1980) as well as other important health behaviors (e.g., Berry, Geller, Calef, & Calef, 1992; Williams, Thyer, Bailey, & Harrison, 1989) . However, university students in this cafeteria setting were not influenced by these traditional intervention techniques. A potential reason for this non-effect points to the response-cost associated with students leaving their place in line in order to enter the restroom, access a sink, and wash their hands.",

Hand-sanitizer gels that contain 60% to 70% ethyl alcohol have both bacterial and viral killing activity (CDC, 2010; Willis, 1995) . Therefore, ethyl alcohol is an ideal hand cleaning method, particularly for busy university students, because in addition to disinfecting hands, it can be easily carried in a person's pocket, brief case or purse; does not require a restroom or faucet and sink; and applying hand sanitizer can take place almost anywhere and anytime. The main goal was to assess whether students would access handsanitizer gel, and which intervention conditions influence the use of hand sanitizer.",

Figure 1 shows the cafeteria had a single entrance/exit location, one cashier counter, one serving line for food, and an open eating area with tables and chairs. The cafeteria was one large room with an open floor plan, so that one could view the entire space from the back of the room. This open floor plan made it possible to observe patrons entering, paying, entering/exiting the restrooms, walking through the serving line, and finally sitting down to eat. The cafeteria had one men's restroom and one women's restroom. The men's restroom had one urinal, one stall, and one sink. The women's restroom had two stalls and one sink. On entering the dining hall, students were required to pay a cashier before going to the cafeteria-style serving lines. Students would pass the two restroom doorways after leaving the cashier and before entering the serving lines. These restrooms were the only locations where students could wash their hands prior to eating.

In both cases, the hand-sanitizer dispenser was placed in the dining hall where it did not interrupt the natural flow of students' accessing lunch lines. In one sense, the hand-sanitizer dispenser became an additional but inserted part of a chain of behaviors leading to food service (see Figure 1 ). Because of dispenser placement, students (a) did not have to leave the area to clean their hands in a restroom, (b) did not lose their place in the serving line, and (c) dispensing of hand sanitizer was quick and easy, a task taking a few seconds. In addition, the present findings are consistent with large-scale behavioral research showing that a prompt occurring in closer proximity to the opportunity to emit the behavior, also known as \"point-of-purchase advertising,\" can be more effective than a more distal prompt (Geller, Farris, & Post, 1973) .",

Similar barriers have shown to decrease intentions to hand wash by medical staff, including such significant predictors as time inconvenience, number of sinks, sink location and availability (Jenner, Watson, Miller, Jones, & Scott, 2002) .

However, the relative contribution made by each component to observed increases in hand hygiene must be considered with caution. The potential serial dependency may have obscured our understanding of how hand sanitizer presented without a change agent might influence student use. The justification of the current design was based on practical reasons. Given the results of our pilot study that revealed low rates of students entering the restrooms to wash their hands, and (more importantly) student insensitivity to interventions, a treatment package of multiple components was deemed appropriate (see Azrin, 1977; Williams et al., 1989 for an example).",

Social assistants function presumably by providing socially-mediated consequences (e.g., approval, respect, and avoidance of negative admonishment). Socially-assisted interventions have been found to improve safety-related behavior over and above the impact of the intervention alone (e.g., Berry et al., 1992; Williams et al., 1989) .

Pathogen risk is not easily detectable by people. Where, when and what pathogens are present, day to day, in the world of objects (e.g., doors, elevator buttons, ATMs and so on) adds to the probabilistic nature of pathogen risk. Thus, it is difficult for a person to determine how and where he or she became exposed and infected by a disease (Ansari, Sattar, Springthorpe, Wells, & Tostowaryk, 1988) . Without reliable natural cues and direct acting consequences, establishing hand washing as a prophylactic response to pathogen risk will likely be difficult. Malott (1988 Malott ( , 1989 suggests that non-direct acting contingencies be supplemented with indirect acting contingencies, defined as establishing sociallycontrived consequences. During the present research, the change agent's association with the hand-sanitizer dispenser showed remarkable influence over hand-hygiene behavior. As mentioned in the Method section, the change agent was instructed to educate students about hand-sanitizer gels, and encourage students to use the sanitizer dispenser. The interactions between the change agent and students over the course of the phases may have provided supplemental social consequences important to the hand sanitizer's effectiveness.",

In our pilot research, as mentioned in the introduction, a change agent was employed to distribute leaflets that stated the importance of hand washing before eating lunch. During this condition, the change agent, leaflet and poster intervention had no effect on students entering the cafeteria restrooms to hand wash. The difference between the pilot study change agent effectiveness and the present study may be due to the change agent's proximity to the hand-hygiene behavior (i.e., point-of-purchase advertising, Geller et al., 1973) . In the present study, both students and the change agent were in close proximity to the sanitizer dispenser, and use of the dispenser was in full view of the change agent. Thus, the change agent was able to apply immediate social consequences for hand hygiene. In contrast, in the pilot study the change agent's ability to give social consequences was impossible due to the distant location of the restroom and subsequent hand washing.",

The greatest expense would be associated with the change agent. Although the change agent was an unpaid research assistant, her average hourly routine included 2 hours of work per day.

Intervention effectiveness may show different results across a more diverse and mature group of people. Third, individual student behavior was not tracked and measured over time. Thus, we were unable to observe the strength of the intervention(s) to control individual variation (e.g., Berry, Gilmore, & Geller, 1994) . Fourth, although change agent plus hand sanitizer and hand sanitizer alone showed increases in hand hygiene, the shortness of the phases (i.e., 3 to 5 days) did not allow for observing long-term maintenance and trends. Future research is encouraged to target issues of hand hygiene maintenance and trends, along with associated health measures to examine long-term health benefits. Research on university student hand hygiene is clearly needed to better ascertain the effectiveness and viability of interventions to influence student hand washing and hand hygiene practices.",
