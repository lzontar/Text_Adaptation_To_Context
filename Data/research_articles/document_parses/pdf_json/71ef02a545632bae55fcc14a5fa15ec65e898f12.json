They can potentially integrate several molecular inputs, perform logical operations, and output an actionable signal and/or autonomously output the appropriate therapeutic. We have reported the development of a deoxyribozyme-based intelligent computational biosensor for the detection of genetic modifications in avian influenza [64, 65] . First, the deoxyribozyme YES iA (E6) gate was constructed, based on a previously reported modular design [99] , that appended a 15 nucleotide molecular beacon recognition loop into a hammerhead-type deoxyribozyme (Fig. 8, left panel) . Using a substrate labeled with a fluorophore and quencher, the YES iA (E6) deoxyribozyme exhibited a 14-fold increase in fluorescent signal intensity, resulting in a detection limit of 22.7 pM target DNA that was resolvable in only 3 min. This impressive detection limit and response time was a consequence of the catalytic behavior of the deoxyribozyme molecular beacon. Unlike traditional molecular beacons that are limited by a 1:1 target:signal stoichiometry, a single target DNA activates a given catalytic beacon, resulting in the cleaving of several substrate molecules. Thus, PCR amplification of target DNA prior to introduction to the sensor may not be We also showed that this system was very sensitive at discriminating the perfect complementary target input from sequences containing single base mutations. We compiled 45 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) containing target sequences, representing all possible single point mutations for each of the 15 positions in the target sequence. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 8 , discrimination between the targets and SNP-containing sequences was possible in only 5 min. Further, the kinetic behavior of the YES iA (E6) deoxyribozyme was impacted by the location and type of mutation in a quasi-predictable manner. This opened the exciting possibility of algorithm based analysis of the sensor output for predicting the exact location and composition of a given mutant [64] .

Surveillance plus antigenic and genetic analysis have been used to monitor known H5N1 variants and identify emerging sublineages [97] . Large-scale sequencing efforts, such as the St. Jude Influenza Genome Project [71] , provide genetic information for the design of computational biosensors that can aid in tracking and characterizing regional strains of H5N1. Since the genomic sequence of influenza viruses is highly mutable [27, 72] given a set of subtypes or strains, it was challenging to find several highly conserved regions that sufficiently distinguish the groups. In designing the FluChip diagnostic microarray, Mehlmann et al. manually inspected a phylogenetic tree of influenza sequences to identify clades that had sufficient sequence similarity [66] . These clades were then used in an automated probe extraction strategy. To encourage process uniformity and minimize design time, we developed extraction methods that minimize the manual intervention in the probe identification process. Using 164 H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences (NCBI Influenza Virus Resource) from samples spanning five different geographic locales (Egypt, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam), we generated a multiple alignment and consensus sequence for each locale using MUSCLE [21] . We then created a multiple alignment of the five consensus sequences, in order to index the nucleotides across all sequences uniformly. To find regions of low variation within a locale, we used an information theory approach. We set a window size of k = 5 nucleotides, and for each index, we calculated the k-mer (words of length k) sequence entropy using the standard entropy equation [18] E i = \u2212 \u2211 w \u2208 words i p i \u00f0w\u00de log 2 p i \u00f0w\u00de where the sum is over all k-length words occurring at position i in the alignment, and p i (w) is the proportion of words found at position i that are equal to w. Thus, positions with low k-mer sequence diversity-e.g., only one or two unique words occurring throughout the alignment at that position-will have low entropy, while positions that have high sequence diversity will have high entropy.
