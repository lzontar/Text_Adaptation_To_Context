These measures resulted in the low spread of cases and no deaths reported by 4 April 2020. This paper aims to share these preliminary experiences of the Vietnamese Government to inform efforts by other countries in containing the spread of COVID-19.

The Taskforce Group was under the leadership of Vice Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam [9] . Since the establishment of the Taskforce Group, several directives and decisions on strengthening measures to prevent and combat COVID-19 were issued with key directions: to suspend flight authorization for all flights from Chinese and other epidemic areas to Vietnam and vice versa; to limit crowds of people, especially at festivals; to suspend festivals which have not yet been opened, and to reduce the scale of the festivals held; to ask people to wear masks in public places; and to limit spring travel and participation in festivals [10] .",

The Emergency Public Health Operations Center was activated in the General Department of Preventive Medicine to guide the provincial Center for Diseases Control (CDCs) on how to prevent and control COVID-19 through epidemiological actions: detection of cases, isolation, tracing cases, and the surveillance of suspected cases and close contact groups. At the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, Vietnam took the initiative to apply early measures, which went beyond the recommendations of the World Health Organization. Vietnam was the first country in the world to apply medical declarations. It became compulsory for everyone entering from China from 25 January 2020, and for all people arriving from elsewhere from 7 March 2020. Vietnam is also one of the few countries to apply measures to suspend visa exemption and restrict entry. In particular, Vietnam applied concentrated isolation with people who entered from or through epidemic areas and with everyone who entered from 21 March 2020. Information about disease prevention, confirmed case reports, and exposure findings were broadcasted daily by almost all channels of the national Vietnamese media. National phone ringtones were also changed to give notice of COVID-19. People were required to install NCOVI health notification software and report daily the health status of themselves and their family members. During the period from 1 April to 15 April 2020, Vietnam implemented social isolation measures across the whole country to prevent the spread of the epidemic in the community.",

The media communicated closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH) on disseminating information on the prevention and control of COVID-19 from the beginning. Official newspapers, government's website [15] , MOH's website [16] and open TV channels provided daily updates on positive cases globally and in Vietnam, and conveyed MOH health messages to prevent and control COVID-19, to large audiences [16] . The broadcasting of specific new cases on national TV, and their related epidemiological information, allowed high risk groups to be traced all over the country, especially during 7-20 March, when many citizens returned to Vietnam from Europe and the United States. The repeated communication on the prevention of COVID-19 (wearing masks, hand washing), and the promotion of social distancing (stay home and keep distance from others at 2 m minimum), was helpful in changing people's behavior toward the epidemic more seriously. Transparent information on positive cases helped to convey the image of government action towards COVID-19. Furthermore, the Ministry of Health created an official account on social media (Zalo), sent SMS to all citizens, and changed waiting ringtones to a voice message to remind about COVID-19 protection measures.",

Before closing, we would like to reflect on the wider applicability of the above experiences and practice. Vietnam has long borders with China and still has contained cases without deaths due to COVID-19. These above-mentioned experiences and practice could be applied to other ASEAN countries that have similar socio-political characteristics, such as Laos and Cambodia. We recognize, however, there are different approaches to containing COVID-19. For example, the South Korean government applied a far more liberal approach with no lockdowns, underpinned by mass testing [21] , which is conceptually different to the strict measures deployed in Vietnam. An appropriate combination of the government's command, control, incentives, and communication is a key to ensure the public's compliance with the government agenda. In Vietnam, a stronger emphasis was made on the central management and leadership by the MOH and the government. However, in other contexts with more diverse political environments this approach may need adapting, for example, in the multi-party political context perhaps more liberal approaches may be more appropriate. The introduction of reporting of personal and family health status needs to consider issues of individual privacy and data confidentiality, which are often a source of large public discourse, for example, in European contexts. Ultimately, any responses in this unprecedented situation need to be globally and nationally context-specific, and ideally informed by documented experiences and practice from different contexts.",
