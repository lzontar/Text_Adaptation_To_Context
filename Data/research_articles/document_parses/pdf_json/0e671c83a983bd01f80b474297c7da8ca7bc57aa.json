All rights reserved Abstract: To determine the role of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in respiratory tract infections (RTIs) of lung transplant recipients, 60 patients were prospectively enrolled in this study spanning from September 2005 to November 2007. Community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) were identi\u00a2ed by polymerase chain reaction and tissue culture in respiratory secretions. Of 112 RTIs, 51 were associated with ! 1 CARV, including 7 HMPV, 13 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 19 parain\u00a3uenza virus 1, 2, or 3 (PIV), 16 in\u00a3uenza A or B (FLU), and 3 human rhinoviruses (HRV). Sixteen CARV-RTIs had multiple pathogens.While the standard protocol was to admit all paramyxoviral RTIs for inhaled ribavirin, 16% CARV-RTIs required hospitalization because of the severity of their respiratory compromise, including 25% of HPMV-single-agent RTI, 38% of RSV single-agent RTI, 10% of PIVsingle-agent RTI, and 19% of multiple-agent RTIs. None of those with non-CARV RTIs required hospitalization. The incidence of clinically diagnosed acute graft rejection in the \u00a2rst 2 months after an RTI varied from 0 for single-agent HRV to 88% for single-agent RSV (25% for single-agent HMPV). A new diagnosis of chronic graft rejection in the \u00a2rst year after an RTI was made in approximately 25% of the RTIs and did not signi\u00a2cantly vary with the etiologic agent. No deaths occurred during this study.

It was less frequent than PIV, FLU, or RSV (incidences of 17%, 14%, and 12%, respectively), roughly as common as HRV (3%), and more common than ADV, which was not found in any of the RTIs in this study. The incidence of HMPV in our patients was similar with the one found by Dare et al. (20) , but somewhat lower than the incidence found by others (21, 22) . RTIs caused by HMPV in the general population are seasonal with an incidence that may vary from year to year (23, 24) . However, it was suggested that in immunocompromised hosts, the incidence of HMPV may be constant (22) . In this study, which extended over 2 years, the HMPV-associated RTIs were equally distributed between years and occurred almost exclusively during the RV season. Furthermore, the incidence of HMPV-associated RTI in this study was not appreciably di\u00a1erent from the 4% incidence that we found in a retrospective investigation of 83 respiratory specimens from 72 lung transplant recipients with RTIs between November 1999 and March 2000 (19, 25) . A multicenter study in pediatric lung transplant recipients that partially overlapped in time with ours (26) showed an incidence of RTI 2-fold higher than the incidence of RTI in our study. This \u00a2nding was not unexpected, as children are generally more susceptible to viral infections than adults. The seasonality of the CARV RTIs in the pediatric study was attenuated by the inclusion of herpes viruses and by the high proportion of ADV and HRV infections, which are endemic. A striking di\u00a1erence was seen in the proportion of ADV and HRV infections in the pediatric study compared with ours. This \u00a2nding may be due to di\u00a1erences in the regional circulation of these viruses, but also begs the question of whether adult transplant recipients maintain some of the immunologic memory of ADVs and HRVs, which mitigates symptomatic infection caused by these agents.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 388, "end": 404, "text": "Dare et al.
