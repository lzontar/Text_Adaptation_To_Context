The term, extreme longevity or superlongevity, is used here to refer to centenarians, that is, persons with a verified age of 100 years or more. Among these we identify for special attention a subgroup known as supercentenarians, that is, persons with a verified age of 110 years or more. In both popular and scientific reporting, people aged 85 years and over have often been considered as extreme aged, but the rapid increase in the number of people in these older age groups suggests a redefinition of the notion of extreme aged. Persons in the broad age group 85 years and over are also referred to as persons of advanced age and the oldest-old. The former description now seems appropriate but the latter one does not. Preferences vary among demographers and gerontologists as to the choice of designations for these groups.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Until recently, the age of 100 has been used by demographers, epidemiologists, and others to define the life span of humans. This was considered to be the age to which a substantial number of humans as a species could survive under optimum health and living conditions, but beyond which only a negligible number of persons could be expected to live. The number defining the life span of humans was not based on any empirical investigation but on general observation, the indications of current life tables, and more importantly, conventional wisdom. Although human life span is a theoretical concept and measure for which no precise value can be given, it has been useful to have such a concept for tracking the gap between the longevity achieved by the average person in a given population and a hypothetical maximum longevity achievable by humans under the most favorable conditions. It also serves a useful purpose in comparative analysis of longevity with other species, to which similar measures have been assigned. In the later discussion, I elaborate on the concept of human life span, seeking to give it a more precise meaning.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Age 120 has often been cited as the maximum life span for humans. This number does not originate in science, but rather in a passage that appears in the Old Testament, \"My spirit will not contend in man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years\" (Genesis 6:3). The record for the maximum recorded human life span, or the highest verified age of a member of the human species, living or deceased, is held by Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at the age of 122 years, 164 days (Exhibit 13.1). There is no validated record of anyone ever surviving to this age or beyond except Mme. Calment. Discounting the case of S. Izumi (who is reputed to have lived 120 years, 237 days) as a case of incorrect documentation, Sarah Knauss appears next in rank for having lived to the age of 119 years, 97 days. Disregarding K. Hongo also (who had an alleged final age of 116 years, 45 days, but whose records were inconsistent), C. Mortenson (115 years, 252 days) is the oldest male ever to have lived.

One is the average or mean age of all persons 100 years or more. I designate this measure the average maximum life span -survivors; it represents the average age of persons over the age of 100 who are alive on a designated date. Depending on the interest of the analyst, either the data for the actual population or the data in the current life table may be employed to compute it. The corresponding measure for decedents 100 or more in a year is Kestenbaum and Ferguson (2005) called the average maximum life span -decedents; it represents the average age at death of those who die at age 100 or beyond in a year. These concepts of life span and their changing values clearly suggest that (maximum) life span is not a fixed number, as has so often been assumed in the past, but may change. Increases in average maximum life span can provide evidence as to whether the members of a given population are tending to live longer or not. Another group measure of extreme longevity, called life endurancy, is a life-table measure only. Life endurancy refers to the age to which 0.005%, 0.001%, or some other specified percent of the initial birth cohort in a life table survives. The shifts in this age for a given level of survivorship from birth may provide evidence that members of a population are living to increasingly advanced ages. Data for these and other measures of extreme longevity are shown in Table 13 .3; they are based on the life tables for 1950, 1980, and 2000 prepared by the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration. The various measures of life span discussed so far are to be distinguished from life expectancy at birth, which, as we have seen, represents the average years of life remaining for a child born in a given year for a particular population, as indicated by a life table. There is currently a gap of roughly 25 years between life expectancy at birth in the United States and average maximum life span (77 years vs. about 102 in the year 2000). This difference suggests how much progress in mortality reduction must be made at this time for the average person in the United States to reach the ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 568, "end": 598, "text": "Kestenbaum and Ferguson (2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1575, "end": 1595, "text": "1950, 1980, and 2000", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1524, "end": 1532, "text": "Table 13", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Population Measures"}, {"text": "Data on the numbers, age distribution, and survival probabilities of the extreme aged may be obtained from censuses and various administrative records (e.g., the files of Social Security beneficiaries and Medicare enrollments).

In general, the U.S. data on the extreme aged, both population and death statistics, have tended to be of too uncertain quality for researchers to be able to determine definitively what the true numbers at the advanced ages are. Often the people at these ages are unable to respond to census takers, so others, such as family members, neighbors, or nursing-home staff, report on their behalf with regard to their residence, age, and other demographic characteristics. Population coverage at particular ages in the census may be grossly misstated and ages are often misreported. In one classic example of age misstatement, analysts at the Social Security Administration determined that a significant number of people who were listed as centenarians in the 1990 Census were, in fact, under the age of 10 (Kestenbaum 1992) .

The considerable uncertainty surrounding the reported figures on the number and ages of alleged supercentenarians and the timing of their deaths is changing, at least for some countries. Increasingly, methods of verification are being applied to the reports of supercentenarians and deaths at the very extreme ages, and a validated file of the extreme aged is being developed for several countries of northern and western Europe, Japan, the United States, and Canada.
