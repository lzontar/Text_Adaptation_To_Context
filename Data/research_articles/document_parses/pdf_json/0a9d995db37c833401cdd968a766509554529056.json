Among the different strategies that are being used to understand the disease and develop effective treatments, the study of physical molecular interactions enables studying fine-grained resolution of the mechanisms behind the virus biology and the human organism response. Here we present a curated dataset of physical molecular interactions, manually extracted by IMEx Consortium curators focused on proteins from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and other members of the Coronaviridae family. Currently, the dataset comprises over 2,200 binarized interactions extracted from 86 publications. The dataset can be accessed in the standard formats recommended by the Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) at the IntAct database website (www.ebi.ac.uk/intact), and will be continuously updated as research on COVID-19 progresses.",

In order to aid the scientific community and expedite drug and vaccine development, multiple data curation efforts have been undertaken to perform a critical assessment of the literature, and represent different aspects of the virus and the disease in a structured and computationally accessible manner. One recent example of such efforts is the COVID-19 Disease Map (3), a community effort to capture the intricate aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology as reusable and interoperable pathway maps, so they can be used in systems biology and modelling pipelines.",

Further to this, such networks can be used to study data such as changes in the transcriptome or proteome of a virally infected cell when compared to normal. Co-regulated genes or proteins which also co-cluster in this network may indicate that these entities are involved in the same biological process or are members of the same functional complex.",

These data need to be supplied in a standardized and computer-accessible format, which allows for scoring, filtering and selection. The IMEx Consortium (4) has been providing such data for over 15 years, supplying experimental details using controlled vocabulary terms, captured using a detailed curation model. All aspects of an interaction experiment are described, including host organism, interaction detection and participant identification methodologies and full details of the constructs, such as binding domains and the effects of site-directed mutations. Current membership of the IMEx Consortium includes the IntAct (5), MINT (6), DIP (7), UniProt (8), MatrixDB (9) , and IID (10) data resources, who collaborate to provide the users with a single, consistent viral-host dataset to work with. When a novel virus emerges, as was the case with SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, the study of closely related species, such as SARS-CoV-1 and other coronaviruses, may help with this process, giving the scientific community time to produce species-relevant data. For this reason the network includes data on all coronaviruses available in the scientific literature. Whilst primarily consisting of protein-protein interaction data, the network also contains interactions with lipids, glycosaminoglycans and RNAs, again curated to IMEx standards. The data is fully open under a CC-BY 4.0 license and downloadable from the IntAct website and FTP in PSI-MI standard tab-delimited and XML-based formats. A brief description can be found under www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/resources/datasets and a collection of interactive network representations of the dataset at the time of writing is available at http://www.ndexbio.org/#/networkset/4c2268a1-a0f0-11ea-aaef-0ac135e8bacf.

Each of these is described by an appropriate controlled vocabulary term, making the data readily searchable. In the Coronavirus dataset, the overwhelming majority of data were generated by affinitypurification combined with mass-spectrometry approaches performed in HEK293(T) or HeLa cells (suppl . Table 1B ). This type of data produces sets of potential interacting partners (preys) associated with a bait of interest, but does not directly identify binary interacting partners. Also, the data needs to be automatically expanded into binaries for its representation in tabular or network graph form. This accounts for a large proportion of spoke-expanded binary relationships found in the dataset: 1,310 out of 2,212 interactions (59%) are expanded binaries, while only 43% of the binary interactions found in the full IntAct database are expanded binaries.",

The extreme urgency in the study of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a strong dominance of high-throughput data for this species in comparison with the other members of Coronaviridae reported in the dataset ( figure 2A) . Lack of overlap between different high-throughput interaction datasets is a long-recognized phenomenon, since different experimental approaches are better suited to detect interactions featuring specific physico-chemical characteristics and protein abundances, among other parameters (16) (17) (18) . Even in this case, where the approach used is broadly similar, they likely reflect methodological differences. AP-MS datasets are very sensitive to protein abundances and affinities, as well as to the selection and orientation of tags and expression systems. Additionally, strong differences can arise during the selection of bona fide interactors, where multiple strategies can be used in order to clean up spurious detections. The lack of common interactions between the different studies focused on SARS-CoV-2 suggest that more of these systematic experiments are needed to increase reliability of biological conclusions extracted from this type of data.",

Pathway enrichment (figure 3 and supplementary table 2) finds commonalities on expected pathways related with cell cycle, response to stress and infectious disease, and DNA and RNA synthesis and processing. Key pathways such as innate immune response or cytokine signaling are only found in one HT study, along with several intracellular signaling and metabolic routes. Only SARS-CoV-1 shows appreciable enrichment in lung tissue, while none of the SARS-CoV-2 sets reach the 5x enrichment threshold suggested by Jain & Tuteja (19) (supplementary figure 1, supplementary table 3) . Finally, SARS-CoV-2 interactors from both studies are found as components of histone deacetylase, exosome and ATP-ase transmembrane complexes (supplementary table 4 ). Including those represented in only one of the studies, we see an abundance of complexes involved in endosome and exosome generation, mitochondrial metabolism, protein production, Ca 2+ -dependent cell signaling and cell cycle control. We are also involved in a parallel effort curating SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 related protein complexes in the Complex Portal (www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal), linking available experimental interaction evidence when possible. This initiative is especially relevant because, as previously stated, coronaviruses increase the number of functional proteins produced by the viral genome by post-translational cleavage of long polypeptide transcripts. The functionality and/or stability of these proteins is further increased through the formation of protein complexes, all of which have been catalogued into the Complex Portal. To date 12 complexes have been identified in each strain, formed by viral-viral protein interactions, including homomeric assemblies such as the dimeric SARS-CoV-2 main protease complex (CPX-5685). Other reference entities such as the SARS-CoV-2 Spike -human ACE2 receptor complex (CPX-5683) have also been created to enable their identification in largeomics datasets. All complexes have been annotated with Gene Ontology terms, describing their role in the virus lifecycle, which again will assist in the analysis of large Omics-derived datasets. Ongoing work includes the addition of the MERS virus complexosome to the available data.",

From our overview analysis of the data available so far, we can highlight how the SARS-CoV-2 data seems to be both biologically relevant, and thus informative for research on the disease, and strongly preliminary, so full consideration for its inherent incompleteness should be given when using it. The IMEx Consortium is expanding the resource as new data becomes available, striving to provide the most accurate possible picture of the Coronaviridae interactome.",

All other plots were created using ggplot2 3.3.0 (24) and wesanderson (25) Enrichment was performed using pathDIP (a database integrating 24 different pathway databases). Only human proteins were considered. The majority of enriched pathways were from Reactome database, so a mapping of each Reactome pathway to the parent pathway ontology was performed, and the heatmap shows the percentage of pathways in each parent pathway over the total of pathways.",
