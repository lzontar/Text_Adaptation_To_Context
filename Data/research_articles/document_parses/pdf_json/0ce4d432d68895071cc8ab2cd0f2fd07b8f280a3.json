Amplification of viral RNA by (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the current gold standard test for confirmation of infection, although it presents known shortcomings: long turnaround times (3-4 hours to generate results), potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates as large as 15-20%, the need for certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel. Thus there is a need for alternative, faster, less expensive and more accessible tests. We developed two machine learning classification models using hematochemical values from routine blood exams (namely: white blood cells counts, and the platelets, CRP, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, LDH plasma levels) drawn from 279 patients who, after being admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) emergencyroom with COVID-19 symptoms, were screened with the rRT-PCR test performed on respiratory tract specimens. Of these patients, 177 resulted positive, whereas 102 received a negative response. We have developed two machine learning models, to discriminate between patients who are either positive or negative to the SARS-CoV-2: their accuracy ranges between 82% and 86%, and sensitivity between 92% e 95%, so comparably well with respect to the gold standard. We also developed an interpretable Decision Tree model as a simple decision aid for clinician interpreting blood tests (even off-line) for COVID-19 suspect cases. This study demonstrated the feasibility and clinical soundness of using blood tests analysis and machine learning as an alternative to rRT-PCR for identifying COVID-19 positive patients. This is especially useful in those countries, like developing ones, suffering from shortages of rRT-PCR reagents and specialized laboratories.

This means that the model yields more robust and reliable prediction for the classified instances (as it is mirrored by the increase in all of the performance measures), while for the other ones it is anyway useful in suggesting further tests, e.g., by either a PCR-RNA swab test or a chest x-ray. In regard to the specificity exhibited by our models, we can further notice that even while these values are relatively low compared with other tests (which are more specific but slower and less accessible), this may not be too much of a limitation as there is a significant disparity between the costs of false positives and false negatives and in fact our models favors sensitivity (thus, they avoid false negatives).

This was tackled by performing nested cross-validation in order to control for bias [43] , and by employing models that are known to be effective also with moderately sized samples [3, 36, 42] . Nonetheless, further research should be aimed at confirming our findings, by integrating hematochemical data from multiple centers and increasing the number of the cases considered. The second limitation may be less obvious, as it regards the reliability of the ground truth itself. Although this was built by means of the current gold standard for COVID-19 detection, i.e., the rRt-PCR test, a recent study observed that the accuracy of this test may be highly affected by problems like inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, sample contamination, and presence of interfering substances, among the others [30] . As a result, some recent studies have reported up to 20% false-negative results for the rRt-PCR test [24, 26, 47] , and a recent systematic review reported an average sensitivity of 92% and cautioned that \"up to 29% of patients could have an initial RT-PCR false-negative result\". Thus, contrary to common belief and some preliminary study (e.g., [11] ), the accuracy of this test could be less than optimal, and this could have affected the reliability of the ground truth also in this study (as in any other using this test for ground truthing, unless cases are annotated after multiple tests. However, besides being a limitation, this is also a further motivation to pursue alternative ways to perform the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as our methods are.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 224, "end": 228, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 321, "end": 324, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 325, "end": 328, "text": "36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 329, "end": 332, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 986, "end": 990, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1098, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1102, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1106, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1340, "end": 1344, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Future work will be devoted to the inclusion of more hematochemical parameters, including those from arterial blood gas assays (ABG), to evaluate their predictiveness with respect to COVID-19 positiveness, and the inclusion of cases whose probability to be COVID-positive is almost 100%, as they resulted positive to two or more swabs or to serologic antibody tests.
