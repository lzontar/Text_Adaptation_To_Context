            "text": "Hypoxaemia is a potential life-threatening yet common complication in the peri-operative and periprocedural patient (e.g. during an invasive procedure at risk of deterioration of gas exchange, such as bronchoscopy). The European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) developed guidelines for the use of noninvasive respiratory support techniques in the hypoxaemic patient in the peri-operative and periprocedural period. The panel outlined five clinical questions regarding treatment with noninvasive respiratory support techniques [conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high flow nasal cannula, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)] for hypoxaemic patients with acute peri-operative/periprocedural respiratory failure. The goal was to assess the available literature on the various noninvasive respiratory support techniques, specifically studies that included adult participants with hypoxaemia in the peri-operative/periprocedural period. The literature search strategy was developed by a Cochrane Anaesthesia and Intensive Care trial search specialist in close collaboration with the panel members and the ESA group methodologist. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the level of evidence and to grade recommendations. The final process was then validated by both ESA and ESICM scientific committees. Among 19 recommendations, the two grade 1B recommendations state that: in the peri-operative/periprocedural hypoxaemic patient, the use of either NIPPV or CPAP (based on local expertise) is preferred to COT for improvement of oxygenation; and that the panel suggests using NIPPV or CPAP immediately post-extubation for hypoxaemic patients at risk of developing acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery. ] and European Journal of Anesthesiology [https ://doi.org/10.1097/EJA.00000 00000 00116 6].",

Therefore, several noninvasive ventilation supports have been proposed for provision of oxygen supplementation in this setting [4] . However, to date no guidelines exist regarding their use. For the purpose of this guideline, hypoxaemia was defined as a ratio between the arterial oxygen pressure and the inspired fraction of oxygen (PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio) below 40 kPa (300 mmHg) [5, 6] .",

Following discussions and votes conducted during several professional meetings under the auspices of ESICM and ESA in 2018, the expert panel outlined five clinical questions regarding treatment with noninvasive respiratory support techniques [conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)] for hypoxaemic patients with acute peri-operative/periprocedural respiratory failure:",

The use of noninvasive respiratory support techniques was superior to COT for improvement of oxygenation in two RCTs [10, 11] . After lung resection, patients randomised to receive NIPPV developed less severe hypoxaemia than those randomised to treatment with COT [11] . After solid organ transplantation, patients randomised to receive NIPPV or COT had improved PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratios in 70 and 25% of cases respectively (P = 0.03) [10] . During and after major vascular surgery when NIPPV was compared with COT, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen was increased in the patients receiving NIPPV at 1 h, 6 h and at the end of intervention (P < 0.01 for all) [13] . Conversely, after abdominal surgery, patients randomised to receive either NIPPV or COT had similar gas exchange on postsurgical day 1 (P = 0.6) [12] .",

However, treatment by staff members who lack appropriate training may occur in certain settings. Untrained clinicians may view noninvasive respiratory support, such as HFNC, as less demanding than invasive ventilation because it requires setting and adaptation of less parameters. Conversely, this system has no alarms. Therefore, treatment with these techniques does not ensure patient safety. The recommendation does not rely on RCTs showing benefit, but rather on clinical judgement.

In a single-centre RCT, Corley et al. applied the Radiological Atelectasis Score to patients with a body mass index above 30 kg m \u22122 after cardiac surgery who were being treated with either HFNC or COT [17] . No differences were found on days 1 and 5 (median score = 2, P = 0.70 and P = 0.15, respectively). Similarly, Parke et al. scored atelectasis observed in chest X-rays to determine whether routine administration of HFNC or COT improved pulmonary function after cardiac surgery. No differences were observed at baseline or on post-extubation days 1 and 3 [39] . In a randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of HFNC with COT in obese patients after cardiac surgery on the rate of atelectasis (primary outcome), chest radiography was performed on days 1 and 5 postoperatively, and the Radiological Atelectasis Score was assessed [18] . In all of these studies, only some of the patients included were actually hypoxaemic.",

The panel recommended the use of NIPPV or CPAP to improve oxygenation and to prevent the risk of reintubation [10] [11] [12] 14] .

Review of the literature on this topic led the panel to emphasise the importance of avoiding delays in tracheal intubation. For example, among 175 ICU patients receiving HFNC, delay in intubation was associated with increased mortality (39.2 vs. 66.7%, P = 0.001) [29] . Such data suggest that these patients should be managed by clinicians skilled in management of the airway and ventilation. Lacking direct evidence, the recommendations were derived from the monitoring used in various RCTs assessing the noninvasive respiratory support techniques [10-14, 18, 21, 23, 24] . Periodic clinical assessment, continuous monitoring (including pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiography) and periodic blood sampling for partial gas pressures were recommended based on indirect evidence. But lacking any evidence, direct or indirect on imaging, no recommendation could be made on this topic",

The panel reported on the rate of complications associated with the use of noninvasive respiratory support techniques. The panel also noted that the HFNC may have an advantage in terms of patient tolerance but the evidence on this is only indirect. Furthermore, tolerance to noninvasive respiratory support seems related to the patient-ventilator interface and ventilatory settings. Only three studies have addressed this issue. All show that NIPPV delivered with a face mask is associated with greater discomfort and less compliance [48, 49] and less treatment failure than with a helmet [13] . One should note that other treatment options may also reduce the incidence of complications, such as semirecumbent positioning in patients at risk of aspiration. The fifth query focused on the best location to initiate a noninvasive respiratory support technique. No recommendation was made on this topic due to the scarcity of data.",

Second, there is significant heterogeneity in the study populations and the outcomes described in the literature (e.g. the time-frame for defining 'reintubation'). Thus, assessing the quantitative effects of the interventions with meta-analysis was not possible. For each recommendation, the evidence was mostly provided by less than a handful of large RCTs. Third, specifically in peri-operative/periprocedural patients, outcomes may also be significantly affected by the type and quality of the surgery/procedure. The current recommendations were formulated with no data on this aspect of patient care. Our analyses did not include specific patient subgroups (e.g. asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). In addition, we had no access to data regarding contraindications to the use of NIPPV or CPAP (e.g. haemodynamic instability, decreased level of consciousness, respiratory failure due to neurological failure, status asthmaticus or facial deformities). In addition, the panel unanimously decided that hypoxaemia is defined by a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio below 40 kPa (300 mmHg). To our knowledge, there is no consensual definition of hypoxaemia, which could be considered as a limitation. Finally, outcomes may depend on the resources available in a specific clinical environment. There is no standard format for reporting the quality of care. Most of the studies identified were conducted in high-income countries. It is uncertain whether the current findings can be extrapolated to other clinical settings [50] .",

There is also no information regarding surgical complications in peri-operative/periprocedural patients. This is a particularly relevant question after upper abdominal surgery. Noninvasive ventilation with high pressures has traditionally been contraindicated after major gastric and oesophageal surgery due to the theoretical risk of gastric dilatation and disruption of surgical anastomoses. Faria et al. [22] reported that NIPPV may be considered in patients with acute respiratory failure after oesophageal surgery, when the insufflation pressure level was less than 12 cmH 2 O and air leaks were absent. However, this statement was based on only three prospective studies [12, 20, 51] . 3. Another issue that requires further investigation is the use of noninvasive respiratory support techniques outside the ICU in the periprocedural/perioperative period. Only one RCT compared patients treated with CPAP with those treated with COT on the ward [23] . Yet surveys reveal that noninvasive respiratory support techniques are routinely used in wards [52] and that nurses in such wards feel inadequately informed about the management of noninvasive respiratory support techniques [53] . The decision to use noninvasive ventilation techniques outside the ICU very much depends on the expertise and means available locally. However, it is important to further study this practice in the context of patient safety. 4. Finally, there is a need to elucidate the means of improving patient and noninvasive respiratory support device interface.",
