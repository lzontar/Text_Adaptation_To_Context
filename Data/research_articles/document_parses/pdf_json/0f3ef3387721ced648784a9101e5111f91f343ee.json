Mostly relying on confirmed diagnoses, another shortcoming of these systems is their ability to detect outbreaks in a timely manner. We investigated the feasibility of using veterinary laboratory test orders in a prospective system to detect outbreaks of disease earlier compared to traditional reporting methods. IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. automatically transferred daily records of laboratory test orders submitted from veterinary providers in Ohio via a secure file transfer protocol. Test products were classified to appropriate syndromic category using their unique identifying number. Counts of each category by county were analyzed to identify unexpected increases using a cumulative sums method. The results indicated that disease events can be detected through the prospective analysis of laboratory test orders and may provide indications of similar disease events in humans before traditional disease reporting.",

A moving 7-day period was chosen to reduce the anticipated day-of-week effect in the data. The expected value was calculated by averaging the weekly counts for the previous 4-week period. We defined alerts as instances when the CuSum value equaled or exceeded five. An alert period was defined as at least two consecutive days where the CuSum value exceeded the threshold. By using this two-in-a-row rule we were able to somewhat reduce the impact of single-day increases on weekly counts. Using this rule has been shown to increase the robustness of CuSum methods [22] . Alerts were considered for all syndromic categories except non-specific, which was mostly comprised of general screening tests such as blood chemistries. We investigated alerts by identifying the specific laboratory product or products involved and contacting select veterinarians located in the same area as the alert asking about their impressions of disease activity.

We then considered the representation of the records both by species of animal and geographic distribution. Finally, we investigated the alerts generated by the pilot system to validate if they might be associated with increases of disease. While no single data source provides the capability to detect all outbreaks that may occur, veterinary providers may be desirable sources to include in surveillance activities for bettering our capabilities of detecting those outbreaks that result from emerging pathogens and potential bioweapon agents [10] , [12] , [16] , [25] , [32] . The change in the number of laboratory orders submitted by veterinary providers may be a valuable proxy to measure the number of individual cases they are treating. An increase in the number of these individual cases may result from an outbreak, detection of which may be possible through the analysis of aggregated laboratory orders counts from several providers in the outbreak area.",

Cases (20 cats and 2 dogs) were equally distributed between two ZIP codes. Follow-up with area veterinarians confirmed that many small animal practices were treating an increased number of animals that lived or spent a significant amount time out-of-doors for unspecified gastrointestinal distress. Following consultation with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, veterinarians suspected that the cases may have resulted from corona virus infections acquired from rodents (Melissa Howell, Preble County Health Department, personal communication). An increased number of rodents were noted in the area, coinciding with the harvesting of local grain fields. Veterinarians speculated that pets may have captured and consumed some of the rodents, resulting in the self-limiting intestinal condition. Although health authorities received no reports of human cases, the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance System used by the Ohio Department of Health indicated significant increases in both gastrointestinal-related chief complaints of emergency department patients and sales of anti-diarrheal medication in these areas during this time (L.S., unpublished data, 2006).The pilot system generated a gastrointestinal alert for Lake County in northeastern Ohio onSeptember 4, 2006. This alert included test orders for specimens originating from ten cats and three dogs submitted by clinics in two ZIP code areas. A local veterinarian from this county telephoned the State Public Health Veterinarian on",
