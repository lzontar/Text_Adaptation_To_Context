Since such patients can progress rapidly without early effective treatment, a delay in diagnosis leads to much worse outcomes. In hospitalized patients, COVID-19 is mostly diagnosed by NP rRT-PCR, and bronchoscopy is rarely required. We argue that allogeneic HCT recipients with LRTI symptoms and a negative Assuming that a negative NP swab rRT-PCR misses 27-50% 12,13 of true COVID-19 with symptoms in the second week, we recommend early bronchoscopy be undertaken when the clinical stakes are high. Time is of the essence in the immunocompromised host and if ARDS has set in by the time the diagnosis of pulmonary COVID-19 is made, an effective treatment window may have been lost. Making the decision to perform bronchoscopy for BAL sampling in allogeneic HCT patients may involve examining the trade-off between the probability of diagnosing COVID-19 and the risk to staff from aerosolization during the procedure. A multidisciplinary discussion involving transplant, infectious diseases, critical care, and/or pulmonary specialists to estimate pre-test probability of COVID-19 and to ascertain the urgency of performing bronchoscopy would be crucial. Bronchoscopy has had an established role in the evaluation of respiratory pathologies in allogeneic HCT patients 14 and should be considered in the event NP rRT-PCR is negative for COVID-19 and also when a possible co-infection e.g., influenza 15 is suspected. Early bronchoscopy in such cases will likely save time by facilitating early diagnosis of pulmonary COVID-19 and may improve survival with use of effective therapies 14 . Furthermore, early diagnosis can potentially decrease the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure to other hospital patients and health care workers caring for such patients. In conclusion, COVID-19 should remain an important differential in patients with LRTI symptoms in the setting of community spread and such patients need early bronchoscopic evaluation even when NP rRT-PCR is negativean expectant stepwise approach is not advised in this population.",
