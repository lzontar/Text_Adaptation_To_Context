It has evolved a multi-faceted, physical and immune defense system to ensure that in the majority of instances, potentially injurious invaders are repelled. Inflammation, predominantly mediated by effector cells of the granulocyte lineage including neutrophils and eosinophils, is a form of immune defense. Where inflammation proves unable to remove an inciting stimulus, chronic inflammatory disease may supervene because of the potential for tissue damage conferred by the presence of large numbers of frustrated, activated granulocytes. Successful recovery from inflammatory disease and resolution of inflammation rely on the clearance of these cells. Ideally, they should undergo apoptosis prior to phagocytosis by macrophage, dendritic, or epithelial cells.

It is not surprising, therefore, that a robust, vigorous, and rapidly responsive immune defense system has evolved over millennia of exposure to diverse and increasingly sophisticated microbes. In addition, air-borne irritant particulate matter such as allergens, biopersistent fibers such as asbestos and combustionderived nanoparticles (e.g., diesel exhaust particles) must be overcome to maintain a high level of function. The architecture of the respiratory system provides a first layer of defense against air-borne microorganisms and particulate matter, effectively blocking the lower airways from anything greater than 5 m in diameter. Inhaled air is warmed and filtered through the nasal hair and nasopharyngeal passages before negotiating the larynx (which ordinarily prevents any intrusion from matter destined for the gastrointestinal system and allows phonation) down the large tubular trachea and into the upper bronchi. The initially large bronchial airways repeatedly bifurcate until they reach an extremely narrow gauge and form alveoli at which point gas exchange with the capillary network that lines the alveolar wall becomes possible. Pseudostratified columnar-ciliated epithelium predominates in the trachea and bronchi forming the muco-ciliary escalator. Any intruding microorganism or misplaced particulate matter slipping out of the air stream in the upper airways is trapped in the muco-ciliary escalator and forced up and out by the regular beating motion of the respiratory cilia.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Should these initial defenses be breached then an intruder must encounter an uninviting but nonspecific chemical milieu including lysozyme, endogenous antimicrobial agents, adverse pH, IgA, and surfactants. 1 Should this fail then a more goaldirected system is brought on line. The respiratory mucosa has developed a sensitive and specific recognition strategy that allows it to identify microbe-specific protein patterns such as lipopolysaccharide, lipotechoic acid, formylated peptides, flagellin, and non-methylated DNA. Once detected, these galvanize resident alveolar macrophages and initiate a variety of proinflammatory pathways that instigate the classical elements of inflammation (calor (heat), rubor (redness), dolor (pain), tumor (swelling), and loss of function as described by Celsus and (debatably) Virchow) 2 driven by increased vascular permeability leading to a proteinaceous infiltrate and leucocyte recruitment. The Tolllike receptors (TLRs) mediate most of this form of recognition and though they each have a specific role, TLRs can function in unison to expand their powers of recognition. 3 Resident alveolar macrophages deal with the majority of insults that trigger this \" Relevance of granulocyte apoptosis to resolution of inflammation at the respiratory mucosa \" REVIEW alert system but if they are overwhelmed recruited leucocytes including granulocytes lend assistance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 207, "end": 208, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1114, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The invading microbes are rendered highly visual to recruited granulocytes by comprehensive opsonization mediated by both complement-dependent and -independent means.

At this point, the interface between the innate and adaptive immune systems occurs as macrophages, which migrate to the lympho-reticular system following ingestion of apoptotic neutrophils, act as antigen-presenting cells allowing the lymphocyte population to complete the resolution and remembrance process. The next time this particular organism is encountered a preprepared, specific response should be available to ensure it has less opportunity to make an impact. 8 The lungs are the arena for another type of granulocyte-driven inflammatory response. Eosinophils are present in larger numbers within the lungs of asthma sufferers and are recruited in greater numbers in response to sensitizing allergens such as pollen, house dust mite, and animal dander. This response has no obvious beneficial effects and it is still unclear why it should occur. The eosinophil is a useful and active defender against parasitic infection and has an armament specific to that end. It has been noted that as parasitic infections have been largely eradicated in Western society, the incidence of this abnormal eosinophil response (termed allergy or atopy) has increased and it seems that eosinophilic inflammation occurs almost as an outlet for redundancy. 1 Inflammation does not always resolve neatly and, unfortunately, for diverse reasons, pulmonary inflammatory disease is one of the biggest drains on health resources in this and many other countries (respiratory disease cost in the United Kingdom was \u00a3 6.6 billion in 2004). 9,10 Non-resolving or chronic inflammation is established when an acute inflammatory response fails to counter an instigating stimulus. In pulmonary infection, this may occur because a microorganism can subvert host defense by surviving either within inflammatory cells ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) or inside a protective micro-environment ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). 11, 12 Persistent inflammation may occur because of a recurrent stimulus like tobacco smoke (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), allergens (asthma), or long (>20 m) biopersistent fibers (asbestosis). 13 Inflammation is also chronic where the host immune system malfunctions and becomes under-or overactive or misdirected as occurs in autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis), immune deficiency syndromes (chronic granulomatous disease, severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome), cystic fibrosis (CF), or adult respiratory distress syndrome / acute lung injury (ARDS / ALI). In some cases, the etiology is unknown and subject to debate (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)). Regardless of the cause, it is apparent that the over-recruitment, ineffective clearance, and hence accumulation and misdirected or frustrated activation of neutrophils and eosinophils lead to tissue damage and an inciting feedback loop of inflammation that perpetuates chronicity 13 ( Figure 1 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 496, "end": 498, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 499, "end": 500, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 559, "end": 560, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 691, "end": 692, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1457, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2233, "end": 2234, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2879, "end": 2882, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2883, "end": 2885, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3090, "end": 3092, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3867, "end": 3869, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3870, "end": 3880, "text": "( Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "It is evident that granulocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation but other cell types such as macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and lymphocytes are equally and potentially more influential in subsets of inflammatory respiratory disease.

This cell differentiates into a common granulocyte progenitor cell, which when given appropriate stimulation can produce any granulocyte lineage. Potential granulocyte lineages include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Basophils are the least well studied and least numerous of the granulocytes, and their physiological function seems to overlap somewhat with that of eosinophils. They are probably meant to counter parasites but their relevance to Western society is in the production of numerous mediators necessary for the incitement of the asthmatic response. Neutrophils and eosinophils are discussed in greater detail below. Granulocytes are terminally differentiated and having therefore exited the cell cycle, they remain in the G 0 phase of growth for the duration of their lives. However, a recent report suggests that postmitotic neutrophils are capable of radical phenotypic switching to take on major characteristics of macrophages when stimulated with growth factors, whereas another study shows that mouse neutrophils can be switched to a dendritic cell phenotype following in vitro incubation with colony-stimulating factor-1. 14, 15 Extravasated granulocytes recruited to the tissues ought to die by apoptosis whilst non-migratory, circulating granulocytes are removed by the combined efforts of the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. There is renewed interest in granulocyte life cycle and differentiation as pharmacological inhibitors of the cell-cycle machinery have been shown to promote granulocyte apoptosis. 16, 17 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1251, "end": 1254, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1257, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1640, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1643, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "GRANULOCYTES"}, {"text": "Neutrophils are 12 -15 m in diameter and account for 70 % of the circulating leucocyte population, which corresponds REVIEW to approximately 2.5 -7.5 \u00d7 10 9 / l neutrophils. They survive in the circulation for approximately 7 -10 h but if compelled by inflammatory circumstance or chemical persuasion can extend their life span up to 48 h and beyond. This population turnover requires efficient production by the bone marrow and prompt clearance by that same organ with help from the spleen and liver. Neutrophils possess at least four different types of granules termed: primary (azurophilic), secondary (specific), gelatinase, and secretory; each carries a specific arsenal of toxic chemicals that the neutrophil uses against non-host elements. The neutrophil is a key effector cell at the front line of immune defense and is efficacious (and lifesaving) in the majority of instances because of its versatility. Neutrophils prove to be effective phagocytes because on accomplishment of this task they are programmed to die a prompt, quiet and importantly, contained, apoptotic death. This limits the time available to internalized microorganisms and prevents hijacking of cellular controls to enable subversion (as is thought to occur when M. tuberculosis is internalized by macrophages 18 ). This timely death also signals larger scale phagocytes such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells to initiate a phagocytic response. If a neutrophil is unable to phagocytose an invader then it will disgorge granule contents into the surrounding environment causing tissue damage and amplifying the inflammatory response. This should not be construed as a purely detrimental response as it serves to block potential routes of entry for invading organisms as tissue damage causes capillary shutdown and collapses lymphatics, sends a strong signal of imperiled defense, and allows time for an alternative immune strategy to be adopted. 8 Neutrophils may also employ extracellular traps to ensnare and kill resistant organisms. Neutrophil extracellular trap formation involves the extrusion of fine chromatin and granulecoated tendrils that are microbicidal and fungicidal. This effort proves fatal to the neutrophil. 19 Finally, neutrophils are not just blunt effectors but also smooth operators responsible for negotiating the recruitment and education of other arms of the immune system. It is becoming appreciated that there is a false division between the innate and adaptive immune response systems and that a more realistic model involves a continual interplay between constituents of these systems. Neutrophils not only alert antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes to danger but regulate their response to it and in return receive counter regulation. Appropriate resolution of an inflammatory immune response is finely balanced. 5 Figure 1 Diagram showing both resolution and failure of resolution of eosinophil-and neutrophil-dominant inflammatory processes. Neutrophilia at the respiratory mucosa is resolved by apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils and phagocytic clearance by macrophages. It fails to resolve where neutrophils are in great excess or are not efficiently cleared and undergo secondary necrosis following apoptosis. This leads to alveolar damage and destruction followed by fibrotic healing. Histology on the right-hand side of the diagram shows neutrophil-dominant inflammation. Eosinophil-dominant inflammation is resolved by the same mechanisms and fails to resolve for the same reasons.

They may survive for up to 12 h in the circulation but have the ability to extend their longevity to over a week if required. Not only are they bigger than neutrophils but they also wear more flamboyant colors when stained by the Romanowsky method (methylene blue and eosin), which accounts for their name. Eosinophils may also be distinguished by their production of Charcot -Leyden crystals (manufactured from lysophospholipase, an eosinophil-derived enzyme), which are often visible in their cytoplasm. Eosinophils, like neutrophils, are supplied with numerous granules though their constituents differ including major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin. This array is certainly capable of tissue damage and probably evolved to combat helminthic infection. Increasingly, new roles for eosinophils are being identified and it seems likely that they have a role in combating viral infection as eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin have been shown to degrade single-stranded RNA viruses. They are said to play an early role in innate immunity by production of important cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 though this is probably only physiologically important in the gastrointestinal tract. They can also modulate adaptive immunity by specific activation of T cells. 20 Eosinophils are implicated in a different spectrum of disease from neutrophils, of which the most common variety is allergic / atopic disease, which includes asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema. In other countries, parasitic infection is still common including schistosomiasis, dranunculoriasis, ascariasis, filariasis, and hookworm. Eosinophil numbers may be increased in various cancers as well as in rare conditions such as Churg -Strauss syndrome, aspergillosis, and eosinophilic pneumonia. In eosinophil-dominant disease, it has been consistently demonstrated that eosinophil excess due to excessive recruitment, apoptosis avoidance, and failed clearance has a correlation with disease pathology.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1507, "end": 1509, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EOSINOPHILS"}, {"text": "Neutrophils and to a lesser extent eosinophils are short-lived cells, a feature that may help to limit their potential for causing damage by ensuring that they cannot be subverted by pathogens. They are explosively reactive cells and it is therefore surprising that their death is a model of contained self-restraint. Apoptosis is a physiological marvel that allows cells with an incendiary cargo (granules) to package it efficiently and safely (in plasma membrane) so that the cellular environment is protected. In addition, the cell nucleus condenses and chromatin is chopped up and re-organized into packages termed nucleosomes. Throughout this process, the cell membrane is retained intact though glycoprotein and phospholipid signals are displayed to attract macrophages and facilitate interaction and uptake (efferocytosis). Fluorescently-tagged Annexin-V is often used to label phosphatidylserine residues, which are characteristically flipped to the outer membrane of apoptotic cells thereby enabling flow cytometric identification of apoptosis. Another member of this family, Annexin-1, has been shown to induce granulocyte apoptosis but is also released by both neutrophils and macrophages to enhance phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. 21, 22 The whole process is amplified by many orders of magnitude during inflammation whether it be neutrophil or eosinophil dominant. Unfortunately, apoptotic cells cannot stay that way forever, and if they are not cleared by phagocytes then they undergo secondary necrosis and all the good work is undone. Large-scale granulocyte recruitment must necessarily be followed by large-scale granulocyte apoptosis and clearance by macrophages. It is extremely important that this is taken into account when plotting to drive granulocyte apoptosis to promote resolution of inflammation. 4, 23 Neutrophil and eosinophil apoptosis are similar but not identical processes. It is generally believed, though not universally, 24 that there are two pathways by which apoptosis proceeds, both of which are ultimately dependent on the caspase family ( Figure 2 ). The intrinsic pathway occurs when the cell faces withdrawal of growth / survival factors, genotoxic stress, or ultraviolet irradiation. This pathway relies on proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, which escape regulation by their antiapoptotic counterparts and translocate to the mitochondria facilitating liberation of cytochrome c . The various components of the apoptosome (Apaf-1, cytochrome c etc.) then assemble to cleave the inactive zymogen, procaspase-9, to active caspase-9, which inexorably commits the cell to caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. The extrinsic pathway proceeds through external cell-membrane death receptors such as the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), the Fas receptor (FasR), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAILR). Ligand activation of these receptors promotes clustering of receptors and association with their internal adaptor proteins (TNFR-associated death domain protein and Fas-associated death domain protein) in the lipid-raft. Multiple procaspase-8 molecules assemble at the adaptor proteins (formation of the death-inducing signaling complex), and their physical approximation generates an autocatalytic reaction initiating the caspase cascade. The death receptor CD137 has also been implicated in neutrophil and eosinophil apoptosis but it is currently unclear what its physiological role is. 25 In neutrophils the importance of caspase action in death receptor-mediated apoptosis has previously been a matter of debate but evidence of caspase-independent apoptosis has been effectively countered by work demonstrating that culture conditions and concentrations of caspase inhibitor had not been optimally utilized in these studies. 26 To further complicate the story, it is apparent that there is a degree of cross talk between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Caspase-8 may alternatively cleave Bid, which can translocate REVIEW to the mitochondrial membrane and permeabilize it allowing apoptosis to proceed through intrinsic pathway apoptotic machinery. 23, 25 Eosinophil apoptosis most likely occurs along approximately the same lines; however, controversy still reigns with regard to the caspase family. It has previously been stated that caspase-3, -8, and -9 have no demonstrable role in eosinophil apoptosis. Subsequently, it has been suggested that perhaps caspase-9 plays a role and that therefore the mitochondrial pathway is of importance. This work was confirmed by observations with regard to the effects of known eosinophil apoptosis-inducing agents such as glucocorticoids, which appear to mediate their effects through mitochondrial permeabilization, with caspase activation merely a downstream effect. In contrast, Fas ligation has been shown to promote eosinophil apoptosis in a caspase-3-and -8-dependent manner, and although mitochondrial integrity was disrupted it proved non-essential for apoptotic progression. 21, 27 -30 Support for the predominance of mitochondria-driven granulocyte apoptosis is provided by the increasing evidence that survival proteins are key determinants of neutrophil longevity. The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1, is present in both neutrophils and eosinophils, but other family members show contrasting expression. Neutrophils express A1, eosinophils express Bcl-xL but Bcl-2 has not been shown to be constitutively present in either cell at demonstrable levels. Interestingly, however, in eosinophils, Bcl-2 expression can be stimulated by IL-5. 31 These survival proteins mediate their effects by marshaling proapoptotic Bcl-2 family counterparts away from the mitochondrial membrane. Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members are capable of causing permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane (MOMP) when numbers predominate over those of their chaperones. Bax is perhaps the best-characterized member of this family and appears to play a pivotal role in neutrophil apoptosis. In eosinophils, however, Bax fails to be downregulated by antiapoptotic survival factors weakening its position as a key player in apoptosis. 32 The role of Mcl-1 in neutrophil apoptosis has received a great deal of attention and it appears that this protein is an essential component of neutrophil viability; a contention that is supported by the neutropenic phenotype of the Mcl-1 knockout mouse in comparison with the increased apoptotic phenotype of the A1 knockout mouse. 33, 34 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1248, "end": 1250, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1826, "end": 1828, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1829, "end": 1831, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1959, "end": 1961, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3454, "end": 3456, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3794, "end": 3796, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 4124, "end": 4127, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 4128, "end": 4130, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 5006, "end": 5012, "text": "27 -30", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5575, "end": 5577, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 6151, "end": 6153, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 6486, "end": 6489, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 6490, "end": 6492, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2082, "end": 2090, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "GRANULOCYTE APOPTOSIS"}, {"text": "Granulocyte longevity is necessarily highly regulated and consequently highly variable from a matter of hours up to several days for neutrophils and extending to 2 weeks for eosinophils.

Perhaps the most important of which is that controlled by the pivotal transcription factor of inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor (NF)-B. NF-B can be activated by lipopolysaccharide, and is known to control the survival proteins XIAP (an inhibitor of caspase-3, -8, and -9) and Bcl-xl thus enhancing neutrophil and eosinophil longevity by tangible means. Pharmacological inhibitors of NF-B such as gliotoxin promote neutrophil apoptosis and, in combination with TNF-, cause dramatically enhanced apoptosis. This feature may partially explain why TNF-has opposing effects on neutrophils at early and late time points. 36, 37 Other important signaling pathways include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway, which can be stimulated by granulocyte macrophagecolony stimulating factor to promote longevity by upregulation of Mcl-1 in neutrophils and which has an emerging role in the maintenance of eosinophilic inflammation. 38, 39 Similarly, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway is likely to be important for survival factor-mediated antiapoptotic effects at sites of inflammation. However, direct inhibition of either of these pathways will not promote granulocyte apoptosis per se . 4, 40 Perhaps the most interesting and clinically relevant modulation of granulocyte apoptosis is that achieved with the use of glucocorticosteroids. These drugs extend neutrophil life span but promote eosinophil apoptosis. This effect seems to correlate with their ability to upregulate Mcl-1 in neutrophils but downregulate the same protein in eosinophils. 41 Dexamethasone has also been shown to promote macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. 42 The impact of putative inflammation-resolving agents on clearance of apoptotic neutrophils is of paramount importance as prompt removal is essential to avoid secondary necrosis and loss of toxic contents. This is perhaps why the discovery of a new class of endogenous lipid-derived proresolution agents has been so exciting. The lipoxin family produced by neutrophils and macrophages limits the recruitment of neutrophils to inflammatory sites and enhances macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. This occurs as part of a natural brake on progression of inflammation and there is hope that enhancement of this pathway may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to counter inflammatory disease, a hypothesis that has already shown promise in several animal models. 43 Another exciting prospect for therapeutic modulation of granulocyte apoptosis has emerged with the discovery of active cell-cycle machinery in neutrophils, which can be inhibited to promote apoptosis. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor drugs promote neutrophil apoptosis and drive resolution of inflammation in animal models. Given that these drugs are already in use for the treatment of cancer, it is possible that they could make the transition from bench to bedside for the management of inflammatory disease in the near future. 17, 44 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 464, "end": 466, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 467, "end": 469, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1180, "text": "36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1183, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1482, "end": 1485, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1488, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1758, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1759, "end": 1761, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2117, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2215, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2988, "end": 2990, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3523, "end": 3526, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3527, "end": 3529, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "REVIEW"}, {"text": "In normal healthy lungs, the predominant alveolar leucocyte is the macrophage, a cell that becomes resident following differentiation from a bone marrow-produced circulating precursor monocyte.

Importantly, during pulmonary infective or inflammatory disease, a key role in resolution of inflammation falls to both alveolar and recruited circulating macrophages.

Neutrophilic inflammation is characteristic of COPD exacerbations and there is a correlation between the resting burden of lung-based neutrophils and severity of disease phenotype. Neutrophilic inflammation appears to be driven by the irritant force as smoking drives alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells to express increased levels of IL-8, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant. IL-8 also stimulates neutrophils to release myeloperoxidase whereas TNF-and leukotriene B 4 (also produced by epithelial cells, mast cells, and T lymphocytes) cause neutrophil activation (degranulation, reactive oxygen species production). Meanwhile, macrophage phagocytic function is impaired by cigarette smoking and cannot keep pace with the increased neutrophil burden. 52 Enhanced neutrophil recruitment and activity combined with decreased macrophage phagocytosis weigh the scales heavily toward neutrophil-mediated tissue damage. COPD lungs are subjected to high levels of toxic neutrophil products including reactive oxygen species, elastase, and proteinases. These toxic substances overload the capacity of native antiproteinases and antioxidants to neutralize them, which leads to damaged epithelial cilia and decreased mucociliary clearance.

For example, it appears that exacerbations of asthma caused by rhinovirus may be facilitated by a defect in interferon induction, which increases susceptibility to invasive disease whereas viral exacerbations or damage caused by chronic inflammatory disease facilitate epidermal growth factor receptor signaling (a wound repair response), which enhances neutrophil function and chemotaxis. 61, 62 The allergy arm of this disease is mediated by IgE, which is produced by B cells in response to an initial exposure to a given antigen. IgE attaches to mast cells and basophils priming them to release histamine, leukotrienes, and ILs at subsequent exposures. Traditionally, asthma is an eosinophil-dominant disease and eosinophils are heavily recruited by the same TH2 cell type signaling (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6) responsible for the production of IgE. This process was thought to be under the direct control of IL-5 but as anti-IL-5 therapy has proved ineffective, it is suspected that there is a greater redundancy in the system. Anti-IL-5 therapy failed to significantly reduce eosinophil numbers in the asthmatic airway but did decrease deposition of extracellular matrix proteins suggesting a role for Il-5 in airway remodeling. 63, 64 Interestingly, an IL-4 analog (pitrakinra), which REVIEW prevents binding of IL-4 and IL-13 to IL-4 receptor complex, attenuated the late-phase response (bronchoconstriction measured by reduction in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s) to allergen challenge. It is as yet unclear whether this success was due to inhibition of IL-4 alone, IL-13 alone, or due to combined inhibition. 65 In addition, a role for TH17 cells has been postulated particularly in forms of asthma where neutrophil recruitment contributes to pathogenesis. 66 Regardless of the super-intending mechanism, it is clear that a heavy burden of apoptosis-resistant eosinophils concomitantly resistant to macrophage phagocytosis, yet capable of disgorging their formidable armament onto the respiratory mucosa, have significant potential to cause tissue damage and airway remodeling. Thankfully, asthma is usually responsive to glucocorticoid therapy partly because steroids are effective at promoting eosinophil apoptosis. 67 This apoptosis may, in direct contrast to experience in neutrophils, be mediated by downregulation of Mcl-1.

(For interested readers, these references give an overview of the pathophysiology of IPF and a flavor of the debate. 1,69 -73 ) The argument is that the initial and subsequent \" exacerbatory \" insults are acute and inflammatory even if the characteristic phenotype is conveyed by a disordered \" healing \" process. Healing by fibrosis results in significant loss of lung architecture and vital respiratory mucosa to scarring. Neutrophils are known to be present in BAL from IPF patients and are also significantly increased within lung tissue. In addition, there is evidence of the toxic chemicals produced by neutrophils including myeloperoxidase, elastase, collagenases, and proteases. The importance of this chemical insult is supported by the elastase knockout mouse, which is significantly protected against lung injury and also fails to upregulate TGF-. 74 A recent clinical paper has shown that significant neutrophilia within the BAL fluid of IPF patients correlates with increased mortality. 75 It has been argued that the terminal scarring process of IPF occurs because of a significant loss of lung architecture and that where lung architecture is preserved there is potential for reversal of the remodeling process and resolution. 72 It has also been suggested that the fibrotic response may in a sense be driven by a persistent but ineffective proresolution of inflammation phenotype. This hypothesis is drawn from the observation that TGF-is a key proresolution molecule but is also intimately involved in fibrogenesis. In a disease model where non-resolving low-level inflammation results in sustained TGF-production, it is possible to conceive that a fibrotic healing phenotype might evolve.

Indeed, persistence of BAL neutrophilia at day 7 is associated with increased mortality. The pulmonary circulation contains a large sequestered neutrophil population termed the \" marginated \" pool that does not normally circulate but is loosely adhered to the vessel walls. This population can be mobilized into the circulation by steroid therapy or by exercise. Neutrophils are subject to slow transit through the pulmonary microvasculature where blood vessel diameters are smaller than their own. The ability of neutrophils to progress depends on their considerable properties of distensibility. In ARDS / ALI, neutrophils are recruited early in large numbers, and an alteration in their rheological properties (they become less deformable) means that they struggle to maneuver through vessels whereas cytokine excess encourages their adhesion to vessel walls and subsequent translocation into the lung parenchyma and airways.

Neutrophils isolated from the BAL of ARDS patients have enhanced longevity, are activated, and may cause insurmountable damage to the respiratory mucosa leading to healing by fibrosis and permanent scarring with loss of lung architecture and function. In experimental models where neutrophils are depleted, ALI caused by endotoxin is attenuated. In other studies, enhancement of neutrophil apoptosis also reduced inflammatory parameters and tissue damage. The picture is complicated by apparent ARDS / ALI in neutropenic human patients. It is also clear that given the extravagant neutrophil influx associated with this condition, it would likely require a dual strategy of enhancing both neutrophil apoptosis and neutrophil clearance to ensure that secondary necrosis (and tissue damage) is prevented by prompt removal. 76, 82 Pneumonia Pneumonia is the term given to an infection within the lower respiratory tract that is sufficiently significant to result in visible changes on a chest radiograph. 83 There are many potential causative organisms including viruses and bacteria. Invading pathogens that overcome immediate host defenses are nonetheless recognized as foreign by their non-host constituents such as lipopolysaccharide or formylated peptides in their outer membranes. TLRs, CD14, and G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., FPR) found on macrophages and other respiratory mucosal cells are responsible for this detection and subsequently stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction by the production of cytokines such as TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. This proinflammatory milieu prolongs neutrophil life span and promotes neutrophil activation to allow effective microbial phagocytosis and killing. 3, 35, 84 If the inflammatory reaction is successful in containing the pathogens and they are cleared by phagocytosis or killed, then the inflammatory reaction remains localized to a single lobe or segment of the lung. The upregulation of anti-inflammatory, proresolution molecules should ensure containment of inflammation. Neutrophil phagocytosis of bacteria and the induction of proresolution cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-promote neutrophil apoptosis and removal by macrophages. 85 The alternative is non-resolution with enhanced neutrophil longevity and local tissue damage (resulting in abscess, empyema, or bronchiectasis) and / or loss of containment resulting in global lung inflammation characterized by ARDS or spread through the circulation to other organs (sepsis) with the potential for MODS.
