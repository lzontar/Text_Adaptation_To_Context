The present study is the first one to study the acceptance and adherence of HCQ prophylaxis for COVID-19. The study found that around 76% of the HCWs had accepted the prophylaxis and taken HCQ at least once as a part of prophylaxis. The finding is comparable with findings of the studies conducted among travellers to assess the acceptance to chloroquine/ mefloquine prophylaxis for malaria, which shows 52% to 89% acceptance rate. 18-21 However, as the present study was conducted among health workers, we could expect a higher acceptance among our study population. As expressed by study participants, common reasons for not taking prophylaxis were fear of side effects, already on other medication and no existing clear evidence on effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis to prevent COVID-19. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] In particular fear of side effects could be attributed to several reports of side effects.

Also, there is no clear evidence of effectiveness of prophylaxis against COVID-19 as it is against malaria. HCWs are well aware of these factors which lead to relatively lesser acceptance .

These findings further justified by significantly lower acceptance among doctors followed by nurse and higher acceptance among other supporting staff. Doctors were high likely to have knowledge on effectiveness and safety of prophylaxis. In the current era of evidence based medical practice, they are likely to reject prophylaxis due to even negligible uncertainty. Study also shows that the perceived threat due to COVID-19 is very less among doctors compared to other professions (details provided in supplementary table 1) and this may hamper the motivation to take chemoprophylaxis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(which was not certified by peer review)"}, {"text": "Among participants who had accepted the prophylaxis, 85% had shown complete adherence.

This may be due to effect of perceived threat on motivation to adhere to prophylaxis. Fear of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2, could have motivated them to strictly adhere to the prophylaxis. Study participants in nursing category had poor adherence, which may be due side effects (relatively higher proportion of nursing officers reported side effects, compared to others). Common reasons given for poor adherence to prophylaxis were forgetting to take drug and development of side effects and these findings were similar to the literature. 18 .
