Only recently we observed a patient with COVID-19 presenting with severe hypocalcemia who had in the history total-thyroidectomy as risk factor for subclinical hypoparathyroidism [13] . Therefore, to our knowledge this is the first study that revealed a very high incidence of hypocalcemia in a large monocentric population of COVID-19 patients at initial hospital evaluation. The observed rate of hypocalcemia was higher in comparison to the previous studies in SARS-CoV and Ebolavirus patients and this could be explained partly because we used serum ionized calcium levels, a more reliable measure than total calcium levels corrected for albumin. Moreover, highly prevalent hypovitaminosis D in the northern regions of Italy may be a predisposing factor in our study population [14] . Calcium levels at initial evaluation were lower in finally hospitalized vs non-hospitalized patients, and hypocalcemia was found to be an independent risk factor for hospitalization. Moreover, the strong association between high LDH and CRP levels and low calcium levels which can be observed in Tumor Lysis Syndrome [15] may support the definition of COVID-19 as a Cytopathic Viral lysis syndrome. This suggests a possible role of ionized calcium as useful biochemical marker of disease aggressiveness, since also easy to measure in emergency, helping clinicians in identifying severe patients at initial hospital evaluation. Moreover, the relative high proportion of patients who developed severe hypocalcemia during hospitalization supports its specific relevance to the disease. In univariate analyses hypocalcemia was also found to be associated with mortality and ICU admission, but this was not maintained in multivariate analyses likely, due to many other interfering factors included different therapeutic approaches.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 420, "end": 424, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1026, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1346, "end": 1350, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, since hypocalcemia is highly incident in COVID-19 patients and predicts the need for hospitalization we suggest that ionized calcium should always be assessed at initial hospital evaluation in order to identify more severe patients.
