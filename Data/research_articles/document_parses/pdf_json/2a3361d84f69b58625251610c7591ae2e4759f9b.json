When 40% oxygen is delivered at an 8 L\u00b7min \u22121 flow rate the exhaled air dispersion distance is, in the same two lung settings, 33 cm and 29 cm, respectively [10] . These distances were studied in a general ward without negative pressure, but with double exhaust fans for room ventilation. When they were off, the air ventilation rates on the ward dropped significantly and the exhaled smoke filled the ward within 5 min. Oxygen therapy via non-rebreathing mask: exhaled air dispersion distance is <10 cm irrespective of oxygen flow rate (6-8-10-12 L\u00b7min \u22121 ) in either normal lung or severe lung injury [6] . CPAP via oronasal mask: (CPAP 5, 10, 15 or 20 cmH 2 O) exhaled air disperses evenly in all directions through the mask's vent holes at a very low normalised smoke concentration irrespective of the severity of lung injury [11] and, therefore, it was not feasible to measure distinct exhaled air dispersion. CPAP via nasal cannula (nasal pillows): there is an increase of air dispersion with increasing CPAP and a reduction of air dispersion with worsening lung injury. Using two types of nasal pillows, at a maximum CPAP of 20 cmH 2 O and with a normal lung, maximum air dispersion distances are 26.4 cm (Nuance Pro Gel) and 33.2 cm (Swift FX) [11] . HFNC: in a normal lung, there is an increase of air dispersion distance with increasing flow to a maximum of 17.2 cm at 60 L\u00b7min \u22121 .

All results shown should, therefore, represent the upper limit of exhaled air dispersion and thus overestimate it.
