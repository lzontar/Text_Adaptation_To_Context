Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time.",

Any type of therapeutic strategies starting from the blocking of viral entry, inhibition of spike proteins association with host ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme type 2), modulations of interfering kinase activity, inactivation of viral genome expression-packaging and vaccination against this virus is the demand of the present situation. Regarding the vaccination strategies, it is assumed that frequent mutation results in anomalies in its surface/spike proteins [2, 3] .",

The positive selective pressure could account for the stability and some clinical features of this virus compared with SARS and Bat SARS-like CoV [5] . Stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for COVID-2019 high ability of contagious, while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating COVID-2019 from SARS CoV [5] . Nevertheless, nutritional and immunological statuses are also important factors for the screening of the therapeutic strategies for the affected and sensitive persons. Possible medications or immunizations from the existing drugs or infusion of convalescent plasma should be conducted with utmost care to the COVID 19 patients [6] . Advanced precautionary steps and therapeutic interventions should be formulated taking into account of several personal and community factors [7] . Development of a successful and reproducible vaccination protocol and its human trial may take longer time for the issues of mutation and large number glycan shield and epitope masking on the SARS CoV 2 proteins [8] .",

ADE might have modulated immune response and could elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm [13, 14] . Possibly, that could be one of the reasons (more history of exposure with CoVs beside weaker immune system) for older people being more affected by the present SARS CoV-2. Moreover, both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels. The novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes [15] . Strong inflammatory events could be the initiator of the collapsing environment during COVID-19 infection. In most of the death cases in COVID-19 infections, acute respiratory failure is followed by other organs like kidney anomalies. In these cases inflammatory outburst might have worsened the infection and post viral-incubation situations [16, 17] . Recent studies in experimentally infected animal strongly suggest a crucial role for virus-induced immune-pathological events in causing fatal pneumonia after human CoV infections [18] . So, combined anti-viral and anti-inflammatory treatment might be beneficial in these cases [19] . SARS-based available immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy to neutralize and protect from infection by targeting the novel spike protein. [20] .",

Structure quality assessment showed QMEAN values of two SARS strains were \u2212 2.82 and \u2212 3.63 for respective models(Table 1). According to the Ramachandran plot analysis on number of residues in favored regions and in additionally allowed regions were ranged from 98.3 to 99.8%; 3%) and COVID 19 (99.4%). were found as very good quality structures. Present structure based prediction was further validated by the multiple sequence alignment of all CoVs and topology analysis of three spike glycoprotein structures of MERS CoV, SARS CoV and COVID-19",
