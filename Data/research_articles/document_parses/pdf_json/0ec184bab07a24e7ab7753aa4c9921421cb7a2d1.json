A literature review found the reproductive number of seasonal influenza to be lower, at 1.19 and 1.37. 11 The emergence of a contagious disease with a higher reproductive number and 10-40 times more lethal than seasonal influenza should concern all of us. Understanding how the disease is spread is paramount to mitigate its spread. As with many coronaviruses, evidence indicates that COVID-19 is spread via respiratory droplets. 4, 8, 12 can travel directly from an infected person to a nearby person after coughing or sneezing. It has been collected on the surfaces of a patient's hospital room after hours to days. 13 The same study established that using standard cleaning agents eliminated the virus from surfaces.",

Source control has three main components: 1) preventing employees who are sick from being at work; 2) limiting the spread of droplets from coughing by applying masks to those with a cough and encouraging employees to cough into their elbow and not their hand or into the open air; and 3) encouraging frequent hand washing. The CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water for more than 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer with at least 60-95% alcohol. 14 Minimizing the sharing of computers and tools between employees is recommended, as is frequent cleaning of surfaces that employees contact such as door knobs, countertops, keyboards, and phones. This recommendation aims to eliminate the virus' spread when source control may have failed. 15 Most of the common cleaning agents registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are believed effective in disinfecting surfaces from COVID-19.

It is based on known literature about the nature of SARS-CoV-2. Identifying infected personnel early in order to isolate them from other members should be a key aspect of any mitigation plan. This involves requesting that employees remain at home if they are sick. 14, 15 Although this concept may be a sharp departure from cultural norms of being a team player and toughing out illness while at work, it is essential to protect the ability of the public safety workforce to provide adequate staffing to the community. Each agency should identify how absences due to illness will be categorized during this pandemic. For employees who may not have paid sick or vacation days available, finding a mechanism to provide compensation while the employee is unable to work may eliminate part of the incentive an employee may feel to hide his or her symptoms in order to remain at work.",

It is estimated that 88% of those infected with COVID-19 will develop fever. The CDC defines fever as a temperature of at least 100.4\u00b0F/ 38\u00b0C. The screening process may also include questions about new symptoms of respiratory infection such as cough, shortness of breath, myalgias, and sore throat. 4 Predetermined processes should be employed to manage employees who screen positive. These include determining whether employees who screen positive will be referred to their primary care physician or to the contracted occupational health organization for a medical evaluation, as well as the requirements for return to work. For employees who test positive for COVID-19 during their subsequent medical evaluation, the local public health agency will be an important partner in determining the return-to-work plan based on current national and local criteria. For employees who test negative for COVID-19 or who are believed to have a different etiology for their symptoms, the evaluating medical provider should provide the employee's return-towork criteria.",
