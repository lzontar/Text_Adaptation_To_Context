Methods This retrospective review includes 154 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed between February 11 and 20, 2020, and 100 patients with other types of viral pneumonia diagnosed between April 2011 and December 2020 from two hospitals. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest was performed. Data on location, distribution, attenuation, maximum lesion range, lobe involvement, number of lesions, air bronchogram signs, Hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and pleural effusion were collected. Associations between imaging characteristics and COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results A peripheral distribution was associated with a 13.04-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a diffuse distribution. A maximum lesion range > 10 cm was associated with a 9.75-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a maximum lesion range \u2264 5 cm, and the involvement of 5 lobes was associated with an 8.45-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a maximum lesion range \u2264 2. No pleural effusion was associated with a 3.58-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia compared with the presence of pleural effusion. Hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was associated with a 2.79-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion A peripheral distribution, a lesion range > 10 cm, involvement of 5 lobes, presence of hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and no pleural effusion were significantly associated with 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia.

In our experience, some patients with positive CT findings may have initial negative result before they were finally confirmed as COVID-19 pneumonia, and they were easily misdiagnosed as common types of viral pneumonia, especially in the non-epidemic area. In addition, there have been a few reports about COVID-19 pneumonia findings on chest CT [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ; however, the reported CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia were extremely similar to common types of viral pneumonia.

Secondly, no pleural effusion was associated with a 3.58-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia compared with the presence of pleural effusion. This finding was associated with few alveolar exudations of interstitial pneumonitis. Notably, hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was found in a few patients and was observed in 43.51% and 20.0% of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and other types of viral pneumonia, respectively. However, hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was associated with a 2.79-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia. This result was different from the study by Bernheim et al [19] . The following reasons would lead to the difference. First, we only included the positive CT finding; however, Bernheim's study included 20/35 (56%) negative CT findings. Second, the interval from the onset of symptoms to the positive CT findings in this study was different from that in Bernheim's study.
