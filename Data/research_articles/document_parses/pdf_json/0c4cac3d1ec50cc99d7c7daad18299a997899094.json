For patients with muscle diseases and cardiomyopathy, interruption of ACE inhibitors or other medications for cardiologic symptoms is not recommended. Also, steroids should not be suspended in Duchenne patients, and in other cases, when possible, dosages of prednisone above 10 mg per day should be revised but, in general, steroids and immunosuppressants should not be routinely discontinued. The same advice is given for patients with nerve disease, neuromuscular junction disorders and other autoimmune diseases other than MS. Degenerative diseases, like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Stroke and Cognitive Disorders are not considered, per se, as risk factors, and patients should be considered moderate or high risk depending on their basal health -for instance, ALS patients with weakened respiratory muscles and FVC<60% should be tagged as high risk, whereas ALS with initial or mild symptoms should not.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "stroke patients could be transferred to non-intensive care wards after completion of 24 hours of observation, if an intensive care unit bed is then required.

The use of rt-PA (recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator) for thrombolysis should be maintained, but extra concern should be raised, as septic patients from COVID-19 can lead to hyper-or hypocoagulability, resulting either in higher chances of unsuccessful reperfusion as well as massive intracerebral hemorrhage, as there is a risk of multiple organ failure in SARS-CoV-2, Depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders are also major concerns.
