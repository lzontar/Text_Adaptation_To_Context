All businesses have a key role to play in minimising the likelihood of transmission and impact on society. Early, bold and effective action will reduce short- term risks to employees and long-term costs to businesses and the  economy.To aid this collective effort, ICC will regularly send updated advice to its network of over 45 million businesses so that businesses everywhere can take informed and effective action to protect their workers, customers and local communities and contribute to the production and distribution of essential supplies.ICC will also contribute to enhancing information flows on the coronavirus outbreak by surveying its global private sector network to map the global business response. This will both encourage businesses to adopt appropriate precautionary approaches and generate new data and insights to support national and international government efforts.As an immediate priority, businesses should be developing or updating, readying or implementing business continuity plans. Business continuity plans should aim to reduce transmission, including by: promoting understanding of the disease, its symptoms and appropriate behavior among employees; setting up a reporting system for any cases and contacts; preparing essentials; limiting travel and physical connectivity; and planning for measures such as teleworking when necessary.
Calls to ActionICC strongly endorses WHO’s call on national governments everywhere to adopt a whole-of- government and whole-of-society approach in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reducing the further spread of COVID-19 and mitigating its impact should be a top priority for Heads of State and Government. Political action should be coordinated with actors in the private sector and civil society to maximize reach of messaging and effectiveness.Governments should commit to making available all necessary resources to combat COVID-19 with the minimum of delay and to ensure that cross-border medical and other essential goods supply chains are able to function effectively and efficientlyICC and the WHO encourage national chambers of commerce to work closely with UN country teams, including WHO country offices where they exist, and to designate mutual focal points to coordinate this collaboration.ICC encourages its members to support their country’s national response efforts and to contribute to the global response efforts coordinated by the WHO through www.covid19responsefund.org.
As the pandemic evolves, ICC Secretary General John W.H Denton AO and WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will continue to coordinate their efforts.Essential information on the COVID-19 pandemic can be found on the WHO’s  dedicated site."

The rapidly increasing demand on health facilities and health care workers threatens to leave some health systems overstretched and unable to operate effectively.

Previous outbreaks have demonstrated that when health systems are overwhelmed, mortality from vaccine-preventable and other treatable conditions can also increase dramatically. During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak, the increased number of deaths caused
by measles, malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis attributable to health system failures exceeded deaths from Ebola
[1,2]. 

“The best defense against any outbreak is a
strong health system,” stressed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“COVID-19 is revealing how fragile many of the world’s health systems and
services are, forcing countries to make difficult choices on how to best meet
the needs of their people.”

To help countries navigate through these challenges, the World Health Organization (WHO) has updated operational planning guidelines in balancing the demands of responding directly to COVID-19 while maintaining essential health service delivery, and mitigating
the risk of system collapse. This includes a set of targeted immediate actions that countries should consider at national, regional, and local level to reorganize and maintain access to high-quality essential health services for all.

Countries should identify essential services that will be prioritized in their efforts to maintain continuity of service delivery and make strategic shifts to ensure that increasingly limited resources provide maximum benefit for the population. They
also need to comply with the highest standard in precautions, especially in hygiene practices, and the provision of adequate supplies including personal protective equipment This requires robust planning and coordinated actions between governments
and health facilities and their managers.

Some examples of essential services include: routine vaccination; reproductive health services including care during pregnancy and childbirth; care of young infants and older adults; management of mental health conditions as well as noncommunicable diseases
and infectious diseases like HIV, malaria and TB; critical inpatient therapies; management of emergency health conditions; auxiliary services like basic diagnostic imaging, laboratory services, and blood bank services, among others.

Well-organized and prepared health systems can continue to provide equitable access to essential service delivery throughout an emergency, limiting direct mortality and avoiding increased indirect mortality. 
 
The guidelines stress the importance of keeping up-to-date information. This requires frequent transparent communications with the public, and strong community engagements so the public   can maintain trust in the system to safely meet their
essential needs and to control infection risk in health facilities. This will help ensure that people continue to seek care when appropriate, and adhere to public health advice.

The objectives of the mission were to understand the current situation; review ongoing response activities; provide on-site technical support as needed; and identify strengths and gaps to guide response priorities.
Considerable efforts have been made by the government in allocating additional dedicated human and financial resources needed to contain the outbreak. Progress has been made in expanding the number of peripheral laboratories that are now able to test for COVID-19, and consideration will be made in engaging overall laboratory capacities. Across the country, 17 laboratories now have the capacity to test cases. An additional four will be added soon and university laboratories will also be engaged. With support from WHO and other partners, Egypt now has the capacity to conduct up to 200,000 tests.
Egypt’s strong disease surveillance system and contact tracing efforts have proven effective in controlling managing sporadic and clusters of cases before they can spread. Recent border closures now provide an opportunity to enhance screening and rapid testing capacity using a risk assessment approach.
Building on the current well-structured Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) programme, WHO will work with national health authorities to enhance the isolation, quarantine and referral mechanisms, and scale up IPC practices to prevent transmission at all levels to ensure that patients and health workers are protected.
Significant efforts have been made to ensure the public is updated on the current situation, including working with other sectors to reach vulnerable populations. Greater coordination and partnerships with civil society, NGOs, and the media will ensure that the public is able to make informed decisions, without succumbing to mistrust and the stigma associated with the disease."

The Committee’s role is to give advice to the Director-General, who makes the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee also provides public health advice or suggests formal Temporary Recommendations as appropriate. 
Proceedings of the meeting
Members and advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by teleconference
The Director-General welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. He turned the meeting over to the Chair, Professor Didier Houssin. 
Professor Houssin also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the Secretariat. 
A representative of the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities.
Committee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting. There were no changes since the previous meeting.  
The Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters. 
Representatives of the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China reported on the current situation and the public health measures being taken. There are now 7711 confirmed and 12167 suspected cases throughout the country. Of the confirmed cases, 1370 are severe and 170 people have died. 124 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital. 
The WHO Secretariat provided an overview of the situation in other countries. There are now 83 cases in 18 countries. Of these, only 7 had no history of travel in China. There has been human-to-human transmission in 3 countries outside China. One of these cases is severe and there have been no deaths. 
At its first meeting, the Committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not. At that time, the advice was that the event did not constitute a PHEIC, but theCommittee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should continue its meeting on the next day, when it reached the same conclusion. 
This second meeting takes place in view of significant increases in numbers of cases and additional countries reporting confirmed cases. 
Conclusions and advice
The Committee welcomed the leadership and political commitment of the very highest levels of Chinese government, their commitment to transparency, and the efforts made to investigate and contain the current outbreak. China quickly identified the virus and shared its sequence, so that other countries could diagnose it quickly and protect themselves, which has resulted in the rapid development of diagnostic tools. 
The very strong measures the country has taken include daily contact with WHO and comprehensive multi-sectoral approaches to prevent further spread. It has also taken public health measures in other cities and provinces; is conducting studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, and sharing data and biological material. The country has also agreed to work with other countries who need their support. The measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world. 
The Committee acknowledged the leading role of WHO and its partners. 
The Committee also acknowledged that there are still many unknowns, cases have now been reported in five WHO regions in one month, and human-to-human transmission has occurred outside Wuhan and outside China. 
The Committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts, and promote social distancing measures commensurate with the risk. It is important to note that as the situation continues to evolve, so will the strategic goals and measures to prevent and reduce spread of the infection. The Committee agreed that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and proposed the following advice to be issued as Temporary Recommendations. 
The Committee emphasized that the declaration of a PHEIC should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China, its people, and the actions China has taken on the frontlines of this outbreak, with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success. In line with the need for global solidarity, the Committee felt that a global coordinated effort is needed to enhance preparedness in other regions of the world that may need additional support for that. 
Advice to WHO
The Committee welcomed a forthcoming WHO multidisciplinary technical mission to China, including national and local experts. The mission should review and support efforts to investigate the animal source of the outbreak, the clinical spectrum of the disease and its severity, the extent of human-to-human transmission in the community and in healthcare facilities, and efforts to control the outbreak. This mission will provide information to the international community to aid in understanding the situation and its impact and enable sharing of experience and successful measures.
The Committee wished to re-emphasize the importance of studying the possible source, to rule out hidden transmission and to inform risk management measures
The Committee also emphasized the need for enhanced surveillance in regions outside Hubei, including pathogen genomic sequencing, to understand whether local cycles of transmission are occurring.
WHO should continue to use its networks of technical experts to assess how best this outbreak can be contained globally. 
WHO should provide intensified support for preparation and response, especially in vulnerable countries and regions.
Measures to ensure rapid development and access to potential vaccines, diagnostics, antiviral medicines and other therapeutics for low- and middle-income countries should be developed. 
WHO should continue to provide all necessary technical and operational support to respond to this outbreak, including with its extensive networks of partners and collaborating institutions, to implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy, and to allow for the advancement of research and scientific developments in relation to this novel coronavirus. 
WHO should continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert between the binary possibilities of PHEIC or no PHEIC, in a way that does not require reopening negotiations on the text of the IHR (2005).
WHO should timely review the situation with transparency and update its evidence-based recommendations.
The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. 
The Director-General declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a PHEIC and accepted the Committee’s advice and issued this advice as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR. 
To the People’s Republic of China
Continue to:
• Implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy to regularly inform the population on the evolution of the outbreak, the prevention and protection measures for the population, and the response measures taken for its containment.  
• Enhance public health measures for containment of the current outbreak.
• Ensure the resilience of the health system and protect the health workforce. 
• Enhance surveillance and active case finding across China.
• Collaborate with WHO and partners to conduct investigations to understand the epidemiology and the evolution of this outbreak and measures to contain it.
• Share relevant data on human cases.
• Continue to identify the zoonotic source of the outbreak, and particularly the potential for circulation with WHO as soon as it becomes available.
• Conduct exit screening at international airports and ports, with the aim of early detection of symptomatic travelers for further evaluation and treatment, while minimizing interference with international traffic.  
To all countries
It is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoVinfection, and to share full data with WHO. Technical advice is available on the WHO website.
Countries are reminded that they are legally required to share information with WHO under the IHR. 
Any detection of 2019-nCoV in an animal (including information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant epidemiological information) should be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an emerging disease.
Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research.  
The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.  
Countries must inform WHO about travel measures taken, as required by the IHR. Countries are cautioned against actions that promote stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR. 
The Committee asked the Director-General to provide further advice on these matters and, if necessary, to make new case-by-case recommendations, in view of this rapidly evolving situation. 
To the global community
As this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronaviruses required substantial efforts to enable regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment.
Provide support to low- and middle-income countries to enable their response to this event, as well as to facilitate access to diagnostics, potential vaccines and therapeutics. 
Under Article 43 of the IHR, States Parties implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours) are obliged to send to WHO the public health rationale and justification within 48 hours of their implementation. WHO will review the justification and may request countries to reconsider their measures. WHO is required to share with other States Parties the information about measures and the justification received.  
The Emergency Committee will be reconvened within three months or earlier, at the discretion of the Director-General. 
The Director-General thanked the Committee for its work."

The World Health Organization (WHO) and World Trade Organization (WTO) are committed to responding effectively to the situation, working together with other international organizations and our respective memberships. Global, coordinated action is required to deal with the extraordinary challenges the pandemic poses to people’s health as well as their livelihoods.  Protecting lives is our top priority, and these efforts can be impeded by unnecessary disruptions to global trade and supply chains. Governments’ trade policy decisions significantly influence both getting medical equipment and supplies to where they are urgently needed and catalyzing the supply of critical inputs for the production of medicines and health technologies to fight the pandemic. Keeping trade in health technologies as open and predictable as possible is therefore of vital interest. This will help countries to respond to this crisis, to recover from it and to build the health systems that will foster greater resilience in the future.
 WHO and WTO are working together to support efforts to ensure the normal cross-border flow of vital medical supplies and other goods and services, promoting them where possible, and to resolve unnecessary disruptions to global supply chains, in furtherance of the International Health Regulations (2005) and WTO rules. 
 The purpose of the International Health Regulations is to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with public health risks, with a view to minimizing interference with international traffic and trade. WTO rules provide governments with the flexibilities they may need to address essential medical supply shortages and/or public health challenges. But any measure taken to promote public health that restricts trade should be “targeted, proportionate, transparent and temporary”, consistent with recent calls from world leaders.  Governments need to avoid measures that can disrupt supply chains and negatively impact the poorest and most vulnerable, notably in developing and least developed countries that are typically reliant on imports of medicines and medical equipment.
 We call on our Members to continue to share information about their measures with WHO and WTO, in line with the established transparency mechanisms, which are now especially valuable in supporting a coordinated response. To ensure that health technologies, including diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and other medical supplies vital to treating patients infected by COVID-19, reach those in need quickly, we emphasize the importance of streamlining conformity checks based on regulatory cooperation and international standards. 
 While we are heartened by the remarkable research efforts and the rapid mobilization of public and private resources to develop COVID-19 health technologies, we call upon governments to implement policy measures that can further facilitate their research and development, and to promote their rapid dissemination within countries and across borders so as to ensure equitable access to those technologies. Such initiatives include targeted investment, ensuring open access to clinical test results, the sharing of relevant intellectual property rights, increasing manufacturing capacity, open and transparent procurement regimes, the elimination of tariffs on relevant health technologies, and trade facilitation measures to reduce costs and delays.
 Global action, solidarity and international cooperation are more necessary than ever to address this health situation.  WHO and the WTO are working together to play their part.​"

WHO's technical lead for the response noted in a press briefing there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41 confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a risk of a possible wider outbreak. The lead also said that human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our experience with SARS, MERS and other respiratory pathogens.  20-21 January 2020

WHO experts from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan.

22 January 2020

WHO mission to China issued a statement saying that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan
    but more investigation was needed to understand the full extent of transmission.

22- 23 January 2020

The WHO Director- General convened an Emergency Committee (EC) under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to assess whether the outbreak constituted a public health
    emergency of international concern. The independent members from around the world could not reach a consensus based on the evidence available at the time. They asked to be reconvened within 10 days after receiving more information.

28 January 2020

A senior WHO delegation led by the Director-General travelled to Beijing to meet China’s leadership,
 learn more about China’s response, and to offer any technical assistance. 
While in Beijing, Dr. Tedros agreed with Chinese government leaders that an international team of leading scientists would travel to China on a mission to better understand the context, the overall response, and exchange information and experience.30 January 2020
The WHO Director-General reconvened the Emergency Committee (EC). This was earlier than the 10-day period and only two days after the first reports of limited human-to-human transmission were reported outside China. This time, the EC reached consensus and advised the Director-General that the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General accepted the recommendation and declared the novel coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV) a PHEIC. This is the 6th time WHO has declared a PHEIC since the International Health Regulations (IHR) came into force in 2005.3 February 2020 
WHO releases the international community's Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to help protect states with weaker health systems. 11-12 February 2020WHO convened a Research and Innovation Forum on COVID-19, attended by more than 400 experts and funders from around the world, which included presentations by George Gao, Director General of China CDC, and Zunyou Wu, China CDC's chief epidemiologist. 16-24 February 2020

The WHO-China Joint mission, which included experts from Canada, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore and the US (CDC, NIH) spent time in Beijing and also travelled to
    Wuhan and two other cities. They spoke with health officials, scientists and health workers in health facilities (maintaining physical distancing).

Two clinical trials addressing this question are underway, and WHO will evaluate the evidence when it is available. In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend neonatal BCG vaccination in countries or settings with a high incidence of tuberculosis.1There is experimental evidence from both animal and human studies that the BCG vaccine has non-specific effects on the immune system. These effects have not been well characterized and their clinical relevance is unknown.2,3On 11 April 2020, WHO updated its ongoing evidence review of the major scientific databases and clinical trial repositories, using English, French and Chinese search terms for COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and BCG.The review yielded three preprints (manuscripts posted online before peer-review), in which the authors compared the incidence of COVID-19 cases in countries where the BCG vaccine is used with countries where it is not used and observed that countries that routinely used the vaccine in neonates had less reported cases of COVID-19 to date. Such ecological studies are prone to significant bias from many confounders, including differences in national demographics and disease burden, testing rates for COVID-19 virus infections, and the stage of the pandemic in each country.  The review also yielded two registered protocols for clinical trials, both of which aim to study the effects of BCG vaccination given to health care workers directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.4,5 BCG vaccination prevents severe forms of tuberculosis in children and diversion of local supplies may result in neonates not being vaccinated, resulting in an increase of disease and deaths from tuberculosis.6-8 In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend neonatal BCG vaccination in countries or settings with a high incidence of tuberculosis.

The virus has shown that it does not discriminate - but many refugees, those forcibly displaced, the stateless and migrants are at heightened risk.  Three-quarters of the world’s refugees and many migrants are hosted in developing regions where health systems are already overwhelmed and under-capacitated.  Many live in overcrowded camps, settlements, makeshift shelters or reception centers, where they lack adequate access to health services, clean water and sanitation. 
 The situation for refugees and migrants held in formal and informal places of detention, in cramped and unsanitary conditions, is particularly worrying. Considering the lethal consequences a COVID-19 outbreak would have, they should be released without delay. Migrant children and their families and those detained without a sufficient legal basis should be immediately released.
 This disease can be controlled only if there is an inclusive approach which protects every individual’s rights to life and health.  Migrants and refugees are disproportionately vulnerable to exclusion, stigma and discrimination, particulary when undocumented.  To avert a catastrophe, governments must do all they can to protect the rights and the health of everyone. Protecting the rights and the health of all people will in fact help control the spread of the virus.
 It is vital that everyone, including all migrants and refugees, are ensured equal access to health services and are effectively included in national responses to COVID-19, including prevention, testing and treatment. Inclusion will help not only to protect the rights of refugees and migrants, but will also serve to protect public health and stem the global spread of COVID-19.  While many nations protect and host refugee and migrant populations, they are often not equipped to respond to crises such as Covid-19. To ensure refugees and migrants have adequate access to national health services, States may need additional financial support. This is where the world’s financial institutions can play a leading role in making funds available.  
 While countries are closing their borders and limiting cross-border movements, there are ways to manage border restrictions in a manner which respects international human rights and refugee protection standards, including the principle of non-refoulement, through quarantine and health checks.  More than ever, as COVID-19 poses a global threat to our collective humanity, our primary focus should be on the preservation of life, regardless of status.  This crisis demands a coherent, effective international approach that leaves no-one behind.  At this crucial moment we all need to rally around a common objective, fighting this deadly virus. Many refugees, displaced, stateless people and migrants have skills and resources that can also be part of the solution.
 We cannot allow fear or intolerance to undermine rights or compromise the effectiveness of responses to the global pandemic. We are all in this together. We can only defeat this virus when each and every one of us is protected."

As part of the agreement, an initial portion of the money from
    the Fund – which currently stands at more than $127 million – will flow to UNICEF for its work with vulnerable children and communities all over the world.“COVID-19 is an unprecedented pandemic requiring extraordinary global solidarity to urgently respond,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “I’m pleased that UNICEF joined the Solidarity
    Response Fund. With their extensive experience both in fundraising and in implementing programmes, this partnership will help us to work together closely to save lives.”The money collected through the fund will be used, among others, to train and equip communities and health-care workers to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19. It will help countries expand their health-care capacity and mitigate its social impact, especially
    on women, children and vulnerable social groups. And it will accelerate research and development of treatments and preventive vaccines.As a key partner in this joined-up effort, UNICEF will lead emergency efforts to ensure families and communities in the most vulnerable countries are fully engaged in the response and have access to water, sanitation and hygiene and other infection prevention
    and control measures. UNICEF will also ensure children, caretakers, and frontline responders such as social workers, teachers and healthcare workers are supported through evidence-based guidance through its vast community outreach and country
    programs.
“This is an extraordinary emergency that demands an extraordinary response, and we need all-hands on deck—individuals, corporations, foundations, governments and other organizations around the world,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta
    Fore. “UNICEF is pleased to join the Solidarity Response Fund. It will bolster our efforts to strengthen health and sanitation systems and help protect the most vulnerable families from knock-on impacts of COVID-19 on already overstretched health
    systems.”
Funds raised will be spent in alignment with the global response plan, and where needs are greatest. At the direction of WHO leadership, it is expected that resources will go directly toward:WHO, for its work to track the spread of the virus, assess gaps and needs, equip frontline health workers with personal protective equipment, ensure lab and testing tools are available in countries around the world, and keep communities
        and frontline responders informed with the latest technical guidance.
        UNICEF, to ensure children and families around the world are equipped with all the evidence-based information and latest WHO guidance as well as locally relevant information to protect themselves from the spread of COVID-19; to support
        vulnerable countries by providing access to water, sanitation and hygiene, and basic infection prevention and control measures; and to provide access to care for vulnerable families and children.CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a key partner leading the financing for research and development for novel vaccines to combat COVID-19, working closely with WHO.The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund was set up at WHO’s request by the UN Foundation and Swiss Philanthropy Foundation and launched three weeks ago. It is the only way for individuals and organizations to contribute directly to WHO’s
            global efforts to tackle the pandemic. To date the fund has $127 million raised or committed from more than 219,000 individuals from all over the world plus more than 90 global companies and organizations. The partnership is also a tremendous
            demonstration of solidarity across UN organizations in coordinating, partnering and supporting each other in dealing with the immediate and longer-term impact of the pandemic. “There has never been a more urgent need for global cooperation,” said Elizabeth Cousens, President & CEO of the UN Foundation. “The COVID-19 pandemic shows us that we all can play a part to stop the spread. The incredible
            generosity shown to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund from around the world will help WHO, UNICEF, CEPI and partners accelerate their lifesaving work, especially to support the most vulnerable communities and speed the development of a
            vaccine.”

Efforts to contain the coronavirus are vital to the
health of the world’s population, but they are also exposing children to increased risk of violence – including maltreatment,
gender-based violence and sexual exploitation.
As leaders of organisations committed to ending violence against children, we come together in solidarity to share our deep
concern, call for action and pledge our support to protect children from violence and reduce the impact of COVID-19 on
children in every country and community.
A third of the global population is on COVID-19 lockdown, and school closures have impacted more than 1.5 billion children.
Movement restrictions, loss of income, isolation, overcrowding and high levels of stress and anxiety are increasing the
likelihood that children experience and observe physical, psychological and sexual abuse at home – particularly those
children already living in violent or dysfunctional family situations. And while online communities have become central to
maintain many children’s learning, support and play, it is also increasing their exposure to cyberbullying, risky online behavior
and sexual exploitation.The situation is aggravated by children’s lack of access to schoolfriends, teachers, social workers and the safe space and
services that schools provide. The most vulnerable children – including refugees, migrants, and children who are internally
displaced, deprived of liberty, living without parental care, living on the street and in urban slums, with disabilities, and living
in conflict-affected areas – are a particular concern. For many, growing economic vulnerability will increase the threat of child
labour, child marriage and child trafficking.
We must act now. Together, we call on governments, the international community and leaders in every sector to urgently
respond with a united effort to protect children from the heightened risk of violence, exploitation and abuse as part of the
broader response to COVID-19.Governments have a central role to play. They must ensure that COVID-19 prevention and response plans integrate age
appropriate and gender sensitive measures to protect all children from violence, neglect and abuse. Child protection services
and workers must be designated as essential and resourced accordingly.
Working with and supporting governments, our collective response must include: maintaining essential health and social
welfare services, including mental health and psychosocial support; providing child protection case management and
emergency alternative care arrangements; ensuring social protection for the most vulnerable children and households;
continuing care and protection for children in institutions; and communicating with and engaging parents, caregivers and
children themselves with evidence-based information and advice. National helplines, school counsellors and other child-friendly
reporting mechanisms enable children in distress to reach out for help, and must be adapted to the challenges of COVID-19.
Given the heightened risks of online harms, technology companies and telecoms providers must do everything they can
to keep children safe online. This includes providing access to cost-free child helplines, age-appropriate services and safe
e-education platforms - and using their platforms to share child online safety advice. They must also do more to detect and
stop harmful activity against children online, including grooming and the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse
images and videos.
As global organisations working to end violence against children, we will continue to advocate for and invest in effective child
protection solutions. We will collectively develop and share technical resources and guidance for policymakers, practitioners,
parents, caregivers and children themselves. And we will support the courageous health, child protection and humanitarian
professionals working around the clock to keep children safe during these unprecedented times.
In recent years, the global community has made significant gains in protecting children from violence. We must not allow those
gains to be lost during the current turmoil. We must do all we can to keep children safe now. And we must plan ahead together,
so that once the immediate health crisis is over, we can get back on track towards the goal of ending all forms of violence,
abuse and neglect of children"
1587502556-24,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/advice-on-the-use-of-point-of-care-immunodiagnostic-tests-for-covid-19,8 April 2020,WHO,,Advice on the use of point-of-care immunodiagnostic tests for COVID-19,"In response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic and shortages of laboratory-based molecular testing capacity and reagents, multiple diagnostic test manufacturers have developed and begun selling rapid and easy-to-use devices to facilitate testing outside
    of laboratory settings. These simple test kits are based either on detection of proteins from the COVID-19 virus in respiratory samples (e.g. sputum, throat swab) or detection, in blood or serum, of human antibodies generated in response to infection.
    
WHO applauds the efforts of test developers to innovate and respond to the needs of the population. 
However, before these tests can be recommended, they must be validated in the appropriate populations and settings. Inadequate tests may miss patients with active infection or falsely categorize patients as having the disease when they do not, further
    hampering disease control efforts. At present, based on current evidence, WHO recommends the use of these new point-of-care immunodiagnostic tests only in research settings. They should not be used in any other setting, including for clinical decision-making, until evidence supporting use for specific indications is available.
WHO continues to evaluate available immunodiagnostics tests for COVID-19 and will update this scientific brief when necessary.
Rapid diagnostic tests based on antigen detectionOne type of rapid diagnostic test (RDT) detects the presence of viral proteins (antigens) expressed by the COVID-19 virus in a sample from the respiratory tract of a person. If the target antigen is present in sufficient concentrations in the sample,
    it will bind to specific antibodies fixed to a paper strip enclosed in a plastic casing and generate a visually detectable signal, typically within 30 minutes. The antigen(s) detected are expressed only when the virus is actively replicating; therefore,
    such tests are best used to identify acute or early infection. How well the tests work depends on several factors, including the time from onset of illness, the concentration of virus in the specimen, the quality of the specimen collected from a person and how it is processed, and the precise formulation of the reagents
    in the test kits. Based on experience with antigen-based RDTs for other respiratory diseases such as influenza, in which affected patients have comparable concentrations of influenza virus in respiratory samples as seen in COVID-19, the sensitivity
    of these tests might be expected to vary from 34% to 80%.1 Based on this information, half or more of COVID-19 infected patients might be missed by such tests, depending on the group of patients tested. These assumptions urgently require further study to understand whether they are accurate. Additionally, false-positive
    results – that is, a test showing that a person is infected when they are not – could occur if the antibodies on the test strip also recognize antigens of viruses other than COVID-19, such as from human coronaviruses that cause the common
    cold. If any of the antigen detection tests that are under development or commercialized demonstrate adequate performance, they could potentially be used as triage tests to rapidly identify patients who are very likely to have COVID-19, reducing or
    eliminating the need for expensive molecular confirmatory testing. With the limited data now available, WHO does not currently recommend the use of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests for patient care, although research into their performance and potential diagnostic utility is highly encouraged.
Rapid diagnostic tests based on host antibody detectionThere is another, more common type of rapid diagnostic test marketed for COVID-19; a test that detects the presence of antibodies in the blood of people believed to have been infected with COVID-19.2-5 Antibodies are produced over days to weeks
    after infection with the virus. The strength of antibody response depends on several factors, including age, nutritional status, severity of disease, and certain medications or infections like HIV that suppress the immune system.6-8 In
    some people with COVID-19, disease confirmed by molecular testing (e.g. reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction: RT-PCR), weak, late or absent antibody responses have been reported.6,7,9 Studies suggest that the majority of patients
    develop antibody response only in the second week after onset of symptoms.2,6,7,10-14 This means that a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection based on antibody response will often only be possible in the recovery phase, when many of the opportunities
    for clinical intervention or interruption of disease transmission have already passed. Antibody detection tests targeting COVID-19 may also cross-react with other pathogens, including other human coronaviruses.7,15,16 and give false-positive
    results.  Lastly, there has been discussion about whether RDTs detecting antibodies could predict whether an individual was immune to reinfection with the COVID-19 virus. There is no evidence to date to support this.
Tests to detect antibody responses to COVID-19 in the population will be critical to support the development of vaccines, and to add to our understanding of the extent of infection among people who are not identified through active case finding and surveillance
    efforts, the attack rate in the population, and the infection fatality rate. For clinical diagnosis, however, such tests have limited utility because they cannot quickly diagnose acute infection to inform actions needed to determine the course of
    treatment. Some clinicians have used these tests for antibody responses to make a presumptive diagnosis of recent COVID-19 disease in cases where molecular testing was negative but where there was a strong epidemiological link to COVID-19 infection
    and paired blood samples (acute and convalescent) showing rising antibody levels.
Based on current data, WHO does not recommend the use of antibody-detecting rapid diagnostic tests for patient care but encourages the continuation of work to establish their usefulness in disease surveillance and epidemiologic research.
 Next steps
Molecular (e.g. PCR) testing of respiratory tract samples is the recommended method for the identification and laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 molecular diagnostic products are being evaluated for quality and safety through the

        of COVID-19 have been published: WHO Guidance on Laboratory testing for COVID-19 in suspected human cases.  In addition,

To inform WHO policy on the use of immunodiagnostic rapid tests for COVID-19, WHO is working with our global laboratory expert network, and closely reviewing the results of laboratory and clinical studies planned and implemented by reference laboratories,
        academic groups and non-governmental organizations. 
Target product profiles for desired COVID-19 diagnostics to inform research and development efforts are in development.
WHO will continue to work with research groups, other agencies, and Member States to develop and interpret data that might indicate specific areas where such tests can be useful for clinical management of cases, epidemiologic understanding, and/or
        infection control. References Bruning AHL, Leeflang MMG, Vos JMBW, Spijker R, de Jong MD, Wolthers KC, et al.

The objectives of the mission were to understand the current situation; review ongoing response activities; provide on-site technical support; and identify strengths and gaps to guide response priorities. The mission which took experts to Cairo and other places, concluded that Egypt is making substantial efforts to control COVID-19 outbreak. “Significant work is being done, especially in the areas of early detection, laboratory testing, isolation, contact tracing and referral of patients,” says Dr Yvan Hutin, Director for Communicable Diseases in WHO’s Regional Office and mission team lead. “But more needs to be done. There is now a critical window of opportunity to effectively control the outbreak before the current local transmission progresses to community transmission. We haveagreed on several areas that can be scaled up, taking a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach.”"

As we mark this sombre moment, the World Health Organization (WHO) reminds all countries and communities that the spread of this virus can be significantly slowed or even reversed through the implementation of robust containment and control activities. China and other countries are demonstrating that spread of the virus can be slowed and impact reduced through the use of universally applicable actions, such as working across society to identify people who are sick, bringing them to care, following up on contacts, preparing hospitals and clinics to manage a surge in patients, and training health workers.WHO calls on all countries to continue efforts that have been effective in limiting the number of cases and slowing the spread of the virus. Every effort to contain the virus and slow the spread saves lives. These efforts give health systems and all of society much needed time to prepare, and researchers more time to identify effective treatments and develop vaccines. Allowing uncontrolled spread should not be a choice of any government, as it will harm not only the citizens of that country but affect other countries as well. We must stop, contain, control, delay and reduce the impact of this virus at every opportunity. Every person has the capacity to contribute, to protect themselves, to protect others, whether in the home, the community, the healthcare system, the workplace or the transport system. Leaders at all levels and in all walks of life must step forward to bring about this commitment across society. WHO will continue to work with all countries, our partners and expert networks to coordinate the international response, develop guidance, distribute supplies, share knowledge and provide people with the information they need to protect themselves and others."

However, a number of medicines have been suggested as potential investigational therapies, many of which are now being or will soon be studied in clinical trials, including the SOLIDARITY trial co-sponsored by WHO and participating countries. In many countries, doctors are giving COVID-19 patients medicines that have not been approved for this disease. The use of licensed medicines for indications that have not been approved by a national medicines regulatory authority is considered “off-label” use. The prescription of medicines for off-label use by doctors may be subject to national laws and regulations. All health care workers should be aware of and comply with the laws and regulations governing their practice. Further, such prescribing should be done on a case-by-case basis. Unnecessary stockpiling and the creation of shortages of approved medicines that are required to treat other diseases should be avoided.  It can be ethically appropriate to offer individual patients experimental interventions on an emergency basis outside clinical trials, provided that no proven effective treatment exists; it is not possible to initiate clinical studies immediately; the patient or his or her legal representative has given informed consent; and the emergency use of the intervention is monitored, and the results are documented and shared in a timely manner with the wider medical and scientific community.  The decision to offer a patient an unproven or experimental treatment is between the doctor and the patient but must comply with national law. Where it is possible and feasible for the treatment to be given as part of a clinical trial, this should be done unless the patient declines to participate in the trial.  If it is not possible to give the treatment as part of a clinical trial, appropriate records of the use of the medicine must be kept, in compliance with national law, and outcomes for patients should be monitored and recorded.
 If early results from an unproven or experimental treatment are promising, the treatment should be studied in the context of a formal clinical trial to establish its safety, efficacy, risks, and benefits.  ReferenceWorld Health Organization.

The African Union, through the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is providing technical support and coordination for the distribution of the supplies.“Commercial flights are grounded and medical cargo is stuck. We can stop this virus in its tracks, but we’ve got to work together. WFP is committed to getting vital medical supplies to front lines and shielding medical workers as they save lives,” said David Beasley, WFP’s Executive Director. “Our air bridges need to be fully funded to do this, and we stand ready to transport frontline health and humanitarian workers as well as medical cargo,” he added.“The Solidarity Flight is part of a larger effort to ship lifesaving medical supplies to 95 countries,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. “I would like thank the African Union, the governments of UAE and Ethiopia, the Jack Ma Foundation and all our partners for their solidarity with African countries at this critical moment in history."" The crucial WHO cargo includes one million face masks, as well as personal protective equipment, which will be enough to protect health workers while treating more than 30 000 patients across the continent and laboratory supplies to support surveillance and detection.“The African Union values the efforts of our partners – the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, the Jack Ma Foundation/Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed – in supporting the African continental strategy for COVID-19 response. The medical supplies are much needed at this critical time that medical commodities are in short supply worldwide,” said Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission. “The African Union will continue to provide the coordination needed as well as resources to ensure that our Member States are able to meet the need for healthcare services during this pandemic,” he added.  “We have seen time and again our health workers fall victim to infectious diseases as they work in hospitals and sometimes pass away,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “This is unacceptable. This personal protective equipment will help keep them safe. WHO is committed to protecting those on the front-lines of health care.”WHO’s logistics hub in Dubai, staffed by a team of seven, has been working around the clock to dispatch over 130 shipments of PPE and laboratory supplies to 95 countries across all six WHO regions.“Thanks to the Government of the United Arab Emirates for its generous support of this operation, WHO’s regional logistics hub in Dubai has played a key role in making sure these supplies are prepared and shipped to where they are most needed. This is by far the largest single shipment of supplies since the start of the pandemic, and will ensure that people living in countries with some of the weakest heaths systems are able to get test and treated, while ensuring that health workers on the frontlines are properly protected,” said Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean.The WFP and WHO extend thanks to the Government of Ethiopia, which helped WFP set up the Addis Ababa Humanitarian Air Hub this week, to help transport protective equipment, medical supplies and humanitarian workers across Africa for the COVID-19 response, as well as ensuring medical evacuations for humanitarian responders.A team of 25 WFP aviation and logistics staff is based at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, managing the 24-hour operation. They manage warehouse space for dry bulk, temperature-controlled and cold storage cargo and its onward transport by air. WFP also provides dedicated cargo tracking, warehouse management and customer service to countries across Africa in collaboration with the Africa CDC. “The medical supplies are timely as the continent still has a window of opportunity to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Collective and fast actions as exemplified by the Solidarity Flight are therefore critical,” said John Nkengasong, Director of the Africa CDC. As part of a global appeal to raise a US$2 billion for the COVID-19 response, launched by the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on 25 March, WFP is calling for US$350 million to establish vital humanitarian hubs around the world to facilitate the storage and dispatch of essential medical cargo, set up air transport links for cargo and personnel, contract charter vessels for shipping services, and provide passenger air and Medevac services for humanitarian and health workers. This includes such Solidary Flights through Addis Ababa.  Currently, WFP has received only 24% (US$84 million) of the US$350 million it requires to provide these vital common services to the global humanitarian community. #                                   #                                  #About WFPThe United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies, building prosperity and supporting a sustainable future for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

These text messages will reach billions of people that aren’t able to connect to the internet for information. Now more than ever, technology must ensure that everyone can access the information they need. The collaboration will start in the Asia Pacific region and then roll out globally. The goal is to reach everyone with vital health messages, whatever their connectivity level. An estimated 3.6 billion people remain offline, with most people who are unconnected living in low-income countries, where an average of just two out of every ten people are online. ITU and WHO call on all telecommunication companies worldwide to join this initiative to help unleash the power of communication technology to save lives from COVID-19. This initiative builds on current efforts to disseminate health messages through the joint WHO-ITU BeHealthy BeMobile initiative.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the first pandemic in human history where technology and social media are being used on a massive scale to keep people safe, productive and connected while being physically apart. Health workers are utilizing telemedicine to diagnose patients and hospitals rely on being connected to coordinate and triage them. Resilient and trustworthy telecommunication networks and services are essential, as more countries, companies and individuals turn to digital technologies to respond to and cope with the impact of COVID-19.Building on their longstanding collaboration, ITU and WHO are committed to identifying and scaling best evidence-based digital health solutions and to leveraging frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data to diagnose, contain and predict outbreaks better and faster.  --------------------------------World Health OrganizationThe World Health Organization provides global leadership in public health within the United Nations system.

The 2-day forum was convened in line with the WHO R&D Blueprint – a strategy for developing drugs and vaccines before epidemics, and accelerating research and development while they are occurring.
“This outbreak is a test of solidarity -- political, financial and scientific. We need to come together to fight a common enemy that does not respect borders, ensure that we have the resources necessary to bring this outbreak to an end and bring our best science to the forefront to find shared answers to shared problems. Research is an integral part of the outbreak response,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “I appreciate the positive response of the research community to join us at short notice and come up with concrete plans and commitment to work together.”
The meeting, hosted in collaboration with GloPID-R (the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness) brought together major research funders and over 300 scientists and researchers from a large variety of disciplines. They discussed all aspects of the outbreak and ways to control it including:

    the natural history of the virus, its transmission and diagnosis; 
    animal and environmental research on the origin of the virus, including management measures at the human-animal interface; 
    epidemiological studies; 
    clinical characterization and management of disease caused by the virus; 
    infection prevention and control, including best ways to protect health care workers;
    research and development for candidate therapeutics and vaccines;
    ethical considerations for research; 
    and integration of social sciences into the outbreak response.

“This meeting allowed us to identify the urgent priorities for research. As a group of funders we will continue to mobilize, coordinate and align our funding to enable the research needed to tackle this crisis and stop the outbreak, in partnership with WHO,” said Professor Yazdan Yazdanpanah, chair of GloPID-R. “Equitable access – making sure we share data and reach those most in need,  in particular those in lower and middle-income countries, is fundamental to this work which must be guided by ethical considerations at all times.”  
During the meeting, the more than 300 scientists and researchers participating both in person and virtually agreed on a set of global research priorities. They also outlined mechanisms for continuing scientific interactions and collaborations beyond the meeting which will be coordinated and facilitated by WHO. They worked with research funders to determine how necessary resources can be mobilized so that critical research can start immediately. 
 The deliberations will form the basis of a research and innovation roadmap charting all the research needed and this will be used by researchers and funders to accelerate the research response.

Like every country, its health system is being challenged by the pandemic. Since the first case was reported on 19 February, WHO has sent seven shipments of emergency medical supplies to the country, including two medicines part of a global research study on treatments for COVID-19, called the Solidarity Trial. “These important medicines will not only support the treatment of patients… but will also help the country contribute significantly to the Solidarity Trial in an effort to find an effective treatment for this virus,” said WHO Representative Dr. Hamlemann. Even overloaded hospitals are able to participate in the study, generating robust data on potential treatments for the virus. Recently, while WHO experts were conducting field trips and technical support work, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education launched a new public campaign to emphasize early detection, contact tracing, and community engagement. Officials from WHO and Iran worked together to identify several priority areas for scale up. “WHO is working closely with the Islamic Republic of Iran in coordinating and providing critical international support to the country during this outbreak,” says Dr. Hamelmann. Soon the number of labs able to test for COVID-19 will rise from 30 to around 50."

Chinese authorities identified the SARS-CoV-2 as the causative virus on 7 January 2020, and the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO on 11 February 2020. As part of WHO’s response to the outbreak, a Research and Development (R&D) Blueprint has been activated to accelerate the development of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus. 
Under WHO’s coordination, a group of experts with diverse backgrounds is working towards the development of vaccines against COVID-19. The group makes a call to everyone to follow recommendations to prevent the transmission of the COVID-19 virus and protect the health of individuals. The group also thanks everyone for putting their trust in the scientific community. 
DeclarationWe are scientists, physicians, funders and manufacturers who have come together as part of an international collaboration, coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO), to help speed the availability of a vaccine against COVID-19. While a vaccine for general use takes time to develop, a vaccine may ultimately be instrumental in controlling this worldwide pandemic. In the interim, we applaud the implementation of community intervention measures that reduce spread of the virus and protect people, including vulnerable populations, and pledge to use the time gained by the widespread adoption of such measures to develop a vaccine as rapidly as possible. We will continue efforts to strengthen the unprecedented worldwide collaboration, cooperation and sharing of data already underway.

WHO recommends all healthy adults do at least 30 minutes a day of physical activity and children at least 60 minutes per day. As part of this, #BeActive and remain #HealthyAtHome include the following suggestions along with any other form of recreation
to stay healthy at home:


    Taking some online exercise classes,
    Dancing,
    Playing active video games,
    Jumping rope, and
    Practising muscle strength and balance training.

“We are delighted that football is strongly supporting the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace by asking everyone to #BeActive and to remain healthy at home during this difficult time,” said António Guterres Secretary-General
of the United Nations. “FIFA has asked the football community, from member associations and clubs, to players and fans, to show their support, to put their rivalries aside and to show a new solidarity so we can overcome the coronavirus.
This is an important lesson not only for today, but for every day.”
“More than ever, especially now, one thing must be clear to everyone, health comes first,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “FIFA is delighted to support both the United Nations and the World Health Organization in amplifying
the #BeActive campaign today, and we are encouraged that the football community is also playing an active role in ensuring the message understood globally. For the first time ever, we are all on the same team and together, with team spirit and
positive energy, we will win.” 
“WHO is proud to collaborate as part of the UN family with FIFA and football lovers worldwide to promote the importance of being active for both physical and mental health,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “The #BeActive campaign supports WHO’s drive to help people be healthy at home.”
The campaign kicks off with Real Madrid CF, FC Barcelona, Liverpool FC and Manchester United FC asking football fans to set aside their rivalries and to come together to #BeActive in order to defeat the coronavirus. Other clubs, including Club América,
CD Guadalajara, Beijing Guoan FC, Shanghai Shenhua FC, Mohun Bagan AC, East Bengal FC, Melbourne City FC, Sydney FC, Auckland City FC, Team Wellington FC, CA River Plate, Olympique de Marseille, TP Mazembe, CR Flamengo and SE Palmeiras will also
join the initiative in the coming days.
As part of the campaign, world-famous players share the following message: “At this time, even rivals need to stick together. We have to keep our distance, but we do not lose our focus. We can show solidarity by being active, and active means
following the guidelines from the WHO.”





The video campaign will
be published on various FIFA digital channels, with regular subsequent updates from clubs and players across the world during subsequent days. #BeActive is also being supported with graphics toolkits for the 211 FIFA member associations and various
media agencies to facilitate additional localisation and to further amplify the message.
WHO, the UN’s specialized health agency, and FIFA, football’s world governing body, collaborate closely to promote healthy lifestyles through football globally and launched the “
Pass the message to kick out coronavirus” campaign last month to share advice effective measures to protect people from COVID-19.
The video campaign can also be downloaded here for editorial purposes."
1587502748-107,https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/support-nurses-and-midwives-through-covid-19-and-beyond,7 April 2020,WHO,,Support Nurses and Midwives through COVID-19 and beyond,"Milan has gone completely quiet,” says Valentina Tommasi, an Italian nurse and professor. “There is no traffic, no people in the city.” But inside Milan’s hospitals, there are more people than ever thought possible including
        hundreds of nurses like Valentina, caring for patients critically ill with COVID19.   Valentina is helping to organize beds in the mornings, and in the afternoons, she’s teaching nurses online. “We need nurses to continue their education and graduate, because right now, we need nurses to work on COVID19.” Within days
        of graduation, her students are donning protective masks and gowns. “We must continue with our work,” says Valentina. “We are strong in this situation.” 
        That’s the message received from dozens of nurses and midwives all over the world this past week. While each has their own experience, they were united in their resolve to do everything in their power to help learn more about and mitigate COVID19.
         Nurses are reorganizing wards to open more beds for COVID19 patients, while keeping others, including women in labour, safe. They’re taking stock of equipment and lending it across units. They’re learning on the job with information that
        changes daily – even hourly. In Delhi, where COVID19 cases on the rise, nurse Ajo Jose has been preparing educational videos, teaching nurses to safely wear one protective mask all day, without scarring their own faces.  
        “We are motivated,” says Ajo. “If we don’t do this right now, there may not be another chance.” 
        In Uganda, midwife Harriet Nayiga is staying in touch with her young clients – vulnerable young women she normally counsels on their sexual and reproductive health and rights. Now, they must all stay home. She is texting and calling those who
        have a phone, “to keep them informed and safe.” She worries for those who she can’t reach.  
        And nurses are doing the unthinkable. In Spain, nurse Silvia Esteban Sepulveda tells us that because critical COVID patients are isolated, the last human touch they may feel is that of a nurse’s hand. “We have had to video-call family
        members late in the night, so they can say goodbye to their dying relative.” 
        Where would we be without our nurses and midwives during this pandemic?And yet, just about everyone we talked with was worried about the need for more personal protective equipment, more medical masks, visors and gowns. Health workers are getting sick. More than 3 000 health workers have been infected with COVID-19.
        Some have died. Among the dead is Liu Fan, a deputy chief nurse working in Wuhan, China. The virus also claimed the lives of her parents and brother. 
        That is a human tragedy. There’s also a practical reality. When health workers are exposed or become sick, they have to go home and stay there for at least two weeks. Hospitals scramble to find replacements.   
        The truth is, there aren’t enough nurses and midwives in the world right now. A new report issued by WHO, Nursing Now and the International Council of Nurses for World Health Day 2020, reveals a global shortfall of 5.9 million nurses - with the greatest gaps found in countries in Africa, South East Asia and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean
        region as well as some parts of Latin America. 
        One nurse told us he is managing a COVID19 quarantine ward where there are two nurses, and about 130 people. Despite his fatigue, he told us that he is proud to contribute to overcoming COVID19. 
        One New York-based nurse, Grace Oghiehor-Enoma, sums up the thoughts of many: 
        “It’s like you’re going into the battlefield. You see the fire, and you’re running into the fire, not thinking about yourself. That is the selflessness that you can see in nursing today.” 
        Why are nurses so committed? Grace tells us that “what is keeping me motivated is seeing the patients recover. Seeing them discharged and going back to their loved ones. That really helps.”

Recognizing the heavy toll that malaria exacts on vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the region’s fragile health infrastructure, WHO underlines the critical importance of sustaining efforts to prevent, detect and treat malaria.“As COVID-19 continues its rapid spread, WHO would like to send a clear message to malaria-affected countries in Africa,” said Dr Pedro Alonso, Director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme. “Do not scale back your planned malaria prevention, diagnostic and treatment activities. If someone living in a place with malaria develops a fever, he or she should seek diagnosis and care as soon as possible.”Ensuring access to core malaria prevention measures is an important strategy for reducing the strain on health systems; these include vector control measures, such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying, as well as chemoprevention for pregnant women and young children (intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy, intermittent preventive treatment in infants and seasonal malaria chemoprevention). Additional special measures could ease the burden on health systems in the context of COVID-19, such as presumptive malaria treatment and mass drug administration.Any interventions must consider the importance of both lowering malaria-related mortality and ensuring the safety of communities and health workers. WHO will provide guidance for countries to safely maintain essential health services in the context of the COVID-19 response.About COVID-19
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Essential information on the COVID-19 pandemic can be found in a dedicated WHO site.About malariaMalaria is a preventable and treatable disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.

Health services, including national programmes to combat TB, need to be actively engaged in ensuring an effective and rapid response to COVID-19 while ensuring that TB services are maintained.
 
In the lead- up to World TB Day, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General emphasized in a news release, “COVID-19 is highlighting just how vulnerable people with lung diseases and weakened immune systems can be. The world committed to end TB by 2030; improving prevention is key to making this happen.”
 
The World Health Organization (WHO) Global TB Programme, along with WHO regional and country offices, has developed an information note, in collaboration with stakeholders. This note is intended to assist national TB programmes and health personnel to urgently maintain continuity of essential services for people affected with TB during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by innovative people-centred approaches, as well as maximizing joint support to tackle both diseases.
 
“We stand in solidarity with those affected by COVID-19 and those at the frontlines of the fight to combat the disease,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of the WHO Global TB Programme. “We need to act with urgency to ensure that in line with our vision of Health for All, no one with TB, COVID-19 or any health condition will miss out on the prevention and care they need.  It’s time for action.”"

Modes of transmission of the COVID-19 virus 
Respiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are >5-10 μm in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are <5μm in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei.1 According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes.2-7 In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.8




Droplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). 
 
Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles <5μm in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m. 
 
In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 


There is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces. However, to date only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen.9  There have been no reports of faecal−oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus to date.
 
Implications of recent findings of detection of COVID-19 virus from air sampling 
To date, some scientific publications provide initial evidence on whether the COVID-19 virus can be detected in the air and thus, some news outlets have suggested that there has been airborne transmission. These initial findings need to be interpreted carefully.
 
A recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine has evaluated virus persistence of the COVID-19 virus.10 In this experimental study, aerosols were generated using a three-jet Collison nebulizer and fed into a Goldberg drum under controlled laboratory conditions. This is a high-powered machine that does not reflect normal human cough conditions. Further, the finding of COVID-19 virus in aerosol particles up to 3 hours does not reflect a clinical setting in which aerosol-generating procedures are performed—that is, this was an experimentally induced aerosol-generating procedure. 
 
There are reports from settings where symptomatic COVID-19 patients have been admitted and in which no COVID-19 RNA was detected in air samples.11-12 WHO is aware of other studies which have evaluated the presence of COVID-19 RNA in air samples, but which are not yet published in peer-reviewed journals. It is important to note that the detection of RNA in environmental samples based on PCR-based assays is not indicative of viable virus that could be transmissible. Further studies are needed to determine whether it is possible to detect COVID-19 virus in air samples from patient rooms where no procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are ongoing. As evidence emerges, it is important to know whether viable virus is found and what role it may play in transmission. 
 
Conclusions
Based on the available evidence, including the recent publications mentioned above, WHO continues to recommend droplet and contact precautions for those people caring for COVID-19 patients. WHO continues to recommend airborne precautions for circumstances and settings in which aerosol generating procedures and support treatment are performed, according to risk assessment.13 These recommendations are consistent with other national and international guidelines, including those developed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine14 and those currently used in Australia, Canada, and United Kingdom.15-17
 
At the same time, other countries and organizations, including the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, recommend airborne precautions for any situation involving the care of COVID-19 patients, and consider the use of medical masks as an acceptable option in case of shortages of respirators (N95, FFP2 or FFP3).18-19 
 
Current WHO recommendations emphasize the importance of rational and appropriate use of all PPE,20 not only masks, which requires correct and rigorous behavior from health care workers, particularly in doffing procedures and hand hygiene practices.21 WHO also recommends staff training on these recommendations,22 as well as the adequate procurement and availability of the necessary PPE and other supplies and facilities. Finally, WHO continues to emphasize the utmost importance of frequent hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and environmental cleaning and disinfection, as well as the importance of maintaining physical distances and avoidance of close, unprotected contact with people with fever or respiratory symptoms. 
 
WHO carefully monitors emerging evidence about this critical topic and will update this scientific brief as more information becomes available.

The fund, the first-of-its-kind, enables private individuals, corporations and institutions anywhere in the world to come together to directly contribute to global response efforts, and has been created by the United Nations Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, together with WHO.  “We are at a critical point in the global response to COVID-19 – we need everyone to get involved in this massive effort to keep the world safe,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “We are immensely grateful to the UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation for coming forward to help us set up this fund. A lot of people and institutions have been saying they want to contribute to the fight against the novel coronavirus. Now they can.”The fund launches with major support already lined up, including from Facebook and Google who have instituted a matching scheme for funds raised through their platforms, while individual donors are also supporting the fund through www.COVID19ResponseFund.org.“We can’t ignore the fact that this is a truly global problem – one that requires truly global solutions,” said Elizabeth Cousens, UN Foundation President and CEO. “The case for global cooperation could not be clearer – communities everywhere are affected, and people want to contribute. This new fund will create space for people everywhere, together, to fight this virus.” Funds will go towards actions outlined in the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to enable all countries – particularly those most vulnerable and at-risk, and with the weakest health systems – to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 crisis including rapidly detecting cases, stopping transmission of the virus, and caring for those affected.WHO and its partners are seeking financing for protective equipment for frontline health workers; to equip diagnostic laboratories; improve surveillance and data collection; establish and maintain intensive care units; strengthen supply chains; accelerate research and development of vaccines and therapeutics;  and take other critical steps to scale up the public health response to the pandemic.The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund is hosted by two foundations, the UN Foundation (registered in the United States) and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation (registered in Switzerland). Both foundations have established relationships with the World Health Organization, allowing for efficient transfer of financial resources to enable COVID-19 response efforts.Apart from giving online at www.COVID19ResponseFund.org, the UN Foundation can also receive donations via check or wire from around the world by contacting COVID19Fund@unfoundation.org.  All donations made to the United Nations Foundation and Swiss Philanthropy Foundation are tax-deductible to the extent allowable by the law, where applicable (U.S. and Switzerland). Additionally, Swiss Philanthropy Foundation has partnered with Transnational Giving Europe to extend tax benefit to certain additional European countries where applicable. ###More: COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response PlanCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak informationAbout the United Nations FoundationThe UN Foundation brings together the ideas, people, and resources the United Nations needs to drive global progress and tackle urgent problems.

The World Health Organization is supporting countries across Africa to step up measures necessary to quickly diagnose and control widespread infection should the virus transmission reach the continent. 
Ethiopia is strengthening surveillance, diagnostics and medical care and public health information and education in readiness for a potential coronavirus outbreak. As COVID-19 is a new pathogen, Ethiopia, like many other countries, lacked the capacity to diagnose it. Adamu Tayachew heads an eight-member technician team at the National Influenza and Arbovirus Laboratory. “We started collecting samples on 25 January 2020. We shipped 11 samples in three phases to South Africa for analysis. The remaining we tested here. The shipment involved a lot of people and complex coordination. It called for working with several bodies to ship the samples and then following up on the results.” WHO has sent reagents to more than 20 countries in Africa, including Ethiopia, to boost diagnostic capacity. Ethiopia’s National Influenza and Arbovirus started testing for the virus on 7 February. “The test is not complicated. We now have the reagents and the necessary documentation. Once the samples are submitted we provide results within the same day. Currently we receive up to four samples a day for testing, but we anticipate that this will increase,” says Mr Adamu."

In a recent interview, the WHO official who headed the joint international mission to China, did not answer a question on Taiwan’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The question of Taiwanese membership in WHO is up to WHO Member States, not WHO staff. However, WHO is working closely with all health authorities who are facing the current coronavirus pandemic, including Taiwanese health experts. The Taiwanese caseload is low relative to population. We continue to follow developments closely. WHO is taking lessons learned from all areas, including Taiwanese health authorities, to share best practices globally.With respect to the COVID-19 outbreak, the WHO Secretariat works with Taiwanese health experts and authorities, following established procedures, to facilitate a fast and effective response and ensure connection and information flow.There is a Taiwanese International Health Regulations Point of Contact, who receives IHR (2005) communications and has access to the Event Information Site (EIS) Platform (a password-protected database and information exchange mechanism supporting the IHR (2005)). The Taiwanese Field Epidemiology Training Program is a member of the Training Programs in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (also known as “TEPHINET”). WHO shares Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network alerts and requests for assistance with TEPHINET, and those messages are cascaded to the TEPHINET members.Two Taiwanese public health experts participated in the Global Research and Innovation Forum organized by WHO on 11-12 February 2020, thus contributing, alongside other world scientists, including from mainland China, to critical research questions and to finding ways to work together to advance the response.

WHO staff work around the world to respond to this pandemic with the best evidence-based guidance and operational support available for all people, based on public health needs.  Membership in WHO and status issues are decided by Member States and the rules they set at WHO’s governing body, the World Health Assembly.Information about COVID-19 can be found here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019"

With the help of a fantasy creature, Ario, “My Hero is You, How kids can fight COVID-19!” explains how children can protect themselves, their families and friends from coronavirus and how to manage difficult emotions when confronted with a
new and rapidly changing reality. 
The book – aimed primarily at children aged 6-11 years old – is a project of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings,
a unique collaboration of United Nations agencies, national and international nongovernmental organizations and international agencies providing mental health and psychosocial support in emergency settings. 
During the early stages of the project, more than 1700 children, parents, caregivers and teachers from around the world shared how they were coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The input was invaluable to script writer and illustrator Helen Patuck and
the project team in making sure that the story and its messages resonated with children from different backgrounds and continents. 
In order to reach as many children as possible, the book will be widely translated, with six language versions released today and more than 30 others in the pipeline. It is being released as both an online product and audio book.

Quotes from collaborating partners
World Health Organization
“Previous humanitarian emergencies have shown us how vital it is to address the fears and anxiety of young people when life as they know it gets turned upside down. We hope that this beautifully-illustrated book, which takes children on a journey across time zones and continents, will help them to understand what they can do to stay positive and keep safe during the coronavirus outbreak.” 
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General
UNICEF
“All over the world, children’s lives have been completely upended — the majority of them living in countries with some form of restricted movement or lockdown. This wonderful book helps children understand and navigate this new landscape and learn how they can take small actions to become the heroes in their own stories.”
Henrietta Fore, Executive Director
UNHCR
“This is an important resource for children around the world with a strong message of inclusion at its heart – that this pandemic can only be beaten if everyone is included in its prevention and response. Children, including those who are refugees, displaced and stateless, can help too. No-one is protected unless we are all protected”.
Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
UNESCO
“Sharing facts and reliable information is vital to respond to COVID-19, and I wish to commend the creativity and passion of all artists, writers and publishers who find compelling ways to translate and craft stories and artwork so they can reach children and families to comfort and guide them through a distressing situation.  UNESCO is proud to support this initiative and we see this as an example of the contribution of the artistic community to the well-being and resilience of all.""

I have no doubt with this type of support that together we will win.” “We need teamwork to combat the coronavirus,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “FIFA has teamed up with WHO because health comes first. I call upon the football community worldwide to join us in supporting this campaign to pass the message even further. Some of the greatest players to have played the beautiful game have put their names to the campaign and are united in their desire to pass the message to kick out COVID-19.” Twenty-eight players are involved in the video campaign, which is being published in 13 languages. Sami Al Jaber (KSA), Alisson Becker (BRA), Emre Belözoğlu (TUR), Jared Borgetti (MEX), Gianluigi Buffon (ITA), Iker Casillas (ESP), Sunil Chhetri (IND), Youri Djorkaeff (FRA), Han Duan (CHN), Samuel Eto’o (CMR), Radamel Falcao (COL), Laura Georges (FRA), Valeri Karpin (RUS), Miroslav Klose (GER), Philipp Lahm (GER), Gary Lineker (ENG), Carli Lloyd (USA), Lionel Messi (ARG), Mido (EGY), Michael Owen (ENG), Park Ji-sung (KOR) , Carles Puyol (ESP), Célia Šašić (GER), Asako Takakura (JPN), Yaya Touré (CIV), Juan Sebastián Verón (ARG), Sun Wen (CHN) and Xavi Hernández (ESP).A video campaign, which will be published on player and FIFA digital channels, is also being provided as individual localized files to the 211 FIFA member associations and media agencies, together with a graphics toolkit for implementation on social media to further pass the message.  Hands:“It starts with your hands,” says Alisson Becker, WHO Goodwill ambassador for health promotion, Liverpool FC and Brazil goalkeeper, and The Best FIFA Men's Goalkeeper, 2019. “Please wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based solution.”
Such frequent washing with soap and water, or preferably with an alcohol-based hand solution, kills viruses that may be on your hands. It is simple, but it is very important. Elbows:
“Cover your nose and mouth with a bent elbow or tissue when you sneeze or cough,” says Carli Lloyd two-time FIFA Women’s World Cup winner from the United States. “Dispose of tissue immediately and wash your hands.”
Droplets spread the coronavirus. By following respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from contracting viruses, such as cold, flu and coronavirus. 
Face:“Avoid touching your face, particularly your eyes, nose or mouth to prevent the virus from entering your body,” adds FC Barcelona and Argentina forward Lionel Messi, The Best FIFA Men’s Player in 2019, and a multiple FIFA Ballon d’Or winner.
Hands touch too many surfaces and can quickly pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your face, from where the virus can move inside your body, making you feel unwell. 
Distance:“In terms of social interaction, take a step back,” says Han Duan, who represented China PR 188 times in an international career that spanned 11 years. “Stay at least one metre distance from others.”
By maintaining such social distancing, you are helping to avoid breathing in any droplets from someone who sneezes or coughs in close proximity. 
Feel – know your symptoms:“If you feel unwell, stay home,” concludes Samuel Eto’o, former FC Barcelona and Cameroon striker, who represented his country 114 times. “Please follow all instructions provided by your local health authorities.”
If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Keep informed as local health authorities provide the latest information on the situation in your area. Please follow their specific instructions, and call in advance to allow them to direct you to the appropriate local health facility. This serves to protect you and to help prevent the spread of virus and other infections. 
FIFA have also pledged $10 million to support the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO.

Healthcare workers rely on personal protective equipment to protect themselves and their patients from being infected and infecting others.But shortages are leaving doctors, nurses and other frontline workers dangerously ill-equipped to care for COVID-19 patients, due to limited access to supplies such as gloves, medical masks, respirators, goggles, face shields, gowns, and aprons.“Without secure supply chains, the risk to healthcare workers around the world is real. Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding. We can’t stop COVID-19 without protecting health workers first,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, prices have surged. Surgical masks have seen a sixfold increase, N95 respirators have trebled and gowns have doubled.Supplies can take months to deliver and market manipulation is widespread, with stocks frequently sold to the highest bidder.WHO has so far shipped nearly half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 47 countries,* but supplies are rapidly depleting.Based on WHO modelling, an estimated 89 million medical masks are required for the COVID-19 response each month. For examination gloves, that figure goes up to 76 million, while international demand for goggles stands at 1.6 million per month. Recent WHO guidance calls for the rational and appropriate use of PPE in healthcare settings, and the effective management of supply chains.WHO is working with governments, industry and the Pandemic Supply Chain Network to boost production and secure allocations for critically affected and at-risk countries.To meet rising global demand, WHO estimates that industry must increase manufacturing by 40 per cent.Governments should develop incentives for industry to ramp up production. This includes easing restrictions on the export and distribution of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies. Every day, WHO is providing guidance, supporting secure supply chains, and delivering critical equipment to countries in need.   *** NOTE TO EDITORSSince the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, countries that have received WHO PPE supplies include:Western Pacific region: Cambodia, Fiji, Kiribati, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and the PhilippinesSoutheast Asia region: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal and Timor-LesteEastern Mediteranean region: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Lebanon, Somalia, Pakistan, Sudan, Jordan, Morocco and IranAfrica region: Senegal, Algeria, Ethiopia, Togo, Ivory Coast, Mauritius, Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Madagascar, Mauritania, Mozambique, Seychelles and Zimbabwe"

FALSIFIED IN VITRO DIAGNOSTICS AND LABORATORY REAGENTS WHO has received multiple reports regarding falsified in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) and laboratory reagents for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Please refer to WHO’s Emergency Use Listing for a list of diagnostics approved for clinical use by WHO. To date, eight countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, PR China, Russian Federation, Singapore, Republic of Korea, United States of America) have listed IVDs for COVID-19 diagnosis based on expedited regulatory assessments. Please note that, in the European Union, regulatory compliance for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics are self-declared by the manufacturer.  To assist Member States and stakeholders, WHO has published the links to these emergency lists, together with contact details. These links provide information on IVDs authorized for use in the jurisdictions of the International Medical Device Regulators Forum, as well as policies and guidance. WHO will provide updated versions as new information becomes available.  End-users are encouraged to check the labelling against the information posted by regulatory authorities upon listing to ensure they are in possession of the genuine product. This information might include product name, product code, expiry date, instructions for use and manufacturer details. 
2. FALSIFIED MEDICINES AND VACCINES At this stage, WHO does not recommend any medicines to treat or cure COVID-19. However, the SOLIDARITY trial, led by WHO, is reviewing potential treatments for COVID-19. At this stage, there is no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. Products claiming to be vaccines to prevent COVID-19 may be considered falsified and may pose significant risks to public health. Unregulated websites supplying medicines and/or vaccines, particularly those concealing their physical address or landline telephone number, are frequently the source of unlicensed, substandard and falsified medical products. WHO has been made aware of various unregistered websites claiming that products on sale can treat or prevent COVID-19. Such products are likely to be falsified medicines. In addition, some websites may appear to provide easy access to legitimate medicines that are otherwise not readily available. End-buyers and consumers should be especially wary of such online scams and exert due-diligence when purchasing any medical product, whether online or not.WHO requests increased vigilance from national health authorities, healthcare professionals, members of the public and supply chain stakeholders worldwide to prevent the distribution of these falsified medical products. Increased vigilance should focus on hospitals, clinics, health centres, clinical laboratories, wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies and any other suppliers of medical products. All medical products must be obtained from authentic and reliable sources. Their authenticity and condition of the product should be carefully checked. Consumers are advised to seek advice from a healthcare professional in case of doubt.National health authorities are requested to immediately notify WHO if these falsified products are discovered in their country.

The Committee’s role is to give advice to the Director-General, who makes the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee also provides public health advice or suggests formal temporary recommendations as appropriate.
Proceedings of the meeting
Members and advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by teleconference. 
The Director-General welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. He turned the meeting over to the Chair, Professor Didier Houssin. 
Professor Houssin also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the Secretariat. 
On 22 January, representatives of WHO’s legal department and the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities.
Committee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting. 
The Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters. 
On 23 January, representatives of the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China, Japan, Thailand and the Republic of Korea updated the committee on the situation in their countries. There have been increased numbers of reported cases in China, with 557 confirmed as of today. 


Conclusions and Advice
On 22 January, the members of the Emergency Committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not. At that time, the advice was that the event did not constitute a PHEIC, but the Committee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should be reconvened in a matter of days to examine the situation further.
After the announcement of new containment measures in Wuhan on 22 January, the Director-General asked the Emergency Committee to reconvene on 23 January to study the information provided by Chinese authorities about the most recent epidemiological evolution and the risk-management measures taken.
Chinese authorities presented new epidemiological information that revealed an increase in the number of cases, of suspected cases, of affected provinces, and the proportion of deaths in currently reported cases of 4% (17 of 557). They reported fourth-generation cases in Wuhan and second-generation cases outside Wuhan, as well as some clusters outside Hubei province. They explained that strong containment measures (closure of public-transportation systems are in place in Wuhan City, as well as other nearby cities). After this presentation, the EC was informed about the evolution in Japan, Republic of Korea, and Thailand, and that one new possible case had been identified in Singapore. 
The Committee welcomed the efforts made by China to investigate and contain the current outbreak. 
The following elements were considered as critical: 
Human-to-human transmission is occurring and a preliminary R0 estimate of 1.4-2.5 was presented. Amplification has occurred in one health care facility. Of confirmed cases, 25% are reported to be severe. The source is still unknown (most likely an animal reservoir) and the extent of human-to-human transmission is still not clear.  
Several members considered that it is still too early to declare a PHEIC, given its restrictive and binary nature.  
Based on these divergent views, the EC formulates the following advice: 
To WHO
The Committee stands ready to be reconvened in approximately ten days’ time, or earlier should the Director-General deem it necessary. 
The Committee urged to support ongoing efforts through a WHO international multidisciplinary mission, including national experts. The mission would review and support efforts to investigate the animal source of the outbreak, the extent of human-to-human transmission, the screening efforts in other provinces of China, the enhancement of surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections in these regions, and to reinforce containment and mitigation measures. A mission would provide information to the international community to aid in understanding of the situation and its potential public health impact. 
WHO should continue to provide all necessary technical and operational support to respond to this outbreak, including with its extensive networks of partners and collaborating institutions, to implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy, and to allow for the advancement of research and scientific developments in relation to this novel coronavirus. 
In the face of an evolving epidemiological situation and the restrictive binary nature of declaring a PHEIC or not, WHO should consider a more nuanced system, which would allow an intermediate level of alert. Such a system would better reflect the severity of an outbreak, its impact, and the required measures, and would facilitate improved international coordination, including research efforts for developing medical counter measures. 
To the People’s Republic of China

    Provide more information on cross-government risk management measures, including crisis management systems at national, provincial, and city levels, and other domestic measures. 
    Enhance rational public health measures for containment and mitigation of the current outbreak. 
    Enhance surveillance and active case finding across China, particularly during the Chinese New Year celebration.
    Collaborate with WHO and partners to conduct investigations to understand the epidemiology and the evolution of this outbreak, including specific investigations to understand the source of the novel coronavirus, notably the animal reservoir, and animals involved in the zoonotic transmission, as well as the understanding of its full potential for human-to-human transmission, and where transmission is taking place, the clinical features associated with infection, and the required treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality.
    Continue to share full data on all cases with WHO, including genome sequences, and details of any health care worker infections or clusters.
    Conduct exit screening at international airports and ports in the affected provinces, with the aims early detection of symptomatic travelers for further evaluation and treatment, while minimizing interference with international traffic. 
    Encourage screening at domestic airports, railway stations, and long-distance bus stations as necessary. 

To other countries
It is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoV infection, and to share full data with WHO.
Countries are required to share information with WHO according to the IHR. 
Technical advice is available here.  Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research. Countries should also follow travel advice from WHO.
To the global community
As this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronaviruses required substantial efforts for regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment.
The Director-General thanked the Committee for its advice."

The guidance provides critical considerations and practical checklists to keep schools safe. It also advises national and local authorities on how to adapt and implement emergency plans for educational facilities. In the event of school closures, the guidance includes recommendations to mitigate against the possible negative impacts on children’s learning and wellbeing. This means having solid plans in place to ensure the continuity of learning, including remote learning options such as online education strategies and radio broadcasts of academic content, and access to essential services for all children. These plans should also include necessary steps for the eventual safe reopening of schools.Where schools remain open, and to make sure that children and their families remain protected and informed, the guidance calls for: Providing children with information about how to protect themselves;Promoting best handwashing and hygiene practices and providing hygiene supplies;Cleaning and disinfecting school buildings, especially water and sanitation facilities; and Increasing airflow and ventilation. The guidance, while specific to countries that have already confirmed the transmission of COVID-19, is still relevant in all other contexts. Education can encourage students to become advocates for disease prevention and control at home, in school, and in their community by talking to others about how to prevent the spread of viruses. Maintaining safe school operations or reopening schools after a closure, requires many considerations, but if done well, can promote public health.For example, safe school guidelines implemented in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone during the outbreak of Ebola virus disease from 2014 to 2016 helped prevent school-based transmissions of the virus.
UNICEF is urging schools – whether open or helping students through remote learning – to provide students with holistic support. Schools should provide children with vital information on handwashing and other measures to protect themselves and their families; facilitate mental health support; and help to prevent stigma and discrimination by encouraging students to be kind to each other and avoid stereotypes when talking about the virus.

The new guidance also offers helpful tips and checklists for parents and caregivers, as well as children and students themselves. These actions include:
Monitoring children’s health and keeping them home from school if they are ill;Encouraging children to ask questions and express their concerns; andCoughing or sneezing into a tissue or your elbow and avoid touching your face, eyes, mouth and nose."

“My biggest worry is that there are countries today who do not have the systems in place to detect people who have contracted with the virus, even if it were to emerge,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Urgent support is needed to bolster weak health systems to detect, diagnose and care for people with the virus, to prevent further human to human transmission and protect health workers.”
 The Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) for the new coronavirus lays out activities and resources needed by international health organizations globally, including WHO, to implement priority public health measures in support of countries to prepare and respond to nCoV-2019 for a period February-April 2020. The objectives of the plan are to  limit human-to-human transmission of the virus, particularly in countries most vulnerable if they were to face an outbreak; identify, isolate and care for patients early; communicate critical risk and event information; minimize social and economic impact; reduce virus spread from animal sources; and address crucial unknowns.
The plan focuses on:

    Rapidly establishing international coordination and operational support;

“The effectiveness of outbreak response depends on the preparedness measures put in place before outbreaks strike,” said Dr Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme. “That is why we are seeking resources to safeguard the most vulnerable countries to protect people from the new coronavirus before it arrives on the doorstep.”
As noted in the SPRP, WHO assesses that the outbreak poses a very high risk in China, and high risk regionally and globally. The risk assessment was based on factors including the likelihood of further spread, the potential impact on human health, and the varying levels of effectiveness in national preparedness and response measures. Accelerated action, as called for in the plan, can address these risks and areas requiring support.
As of 10 a.m. Central European Time on 5 February, 25 countries have reported confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, including China, where 24,363 people had contracted the virus, or over 99% of all cases. In all other countries, 191 cases have contracted the virus."

""Harnessing the power of science is critical for bringing this outbreak under control,"" said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “There are questions we need answers to, and tools we need developed as quickly as possible. WHO is playing an important coordinating role by bringing the scientific community together to identify research priorities and accelerate progress.”
The forum, to be held 11-12 February in Geneva, is organized in collaboration with the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness.
The forum will bring together key players including leading scientists as well as public health agencies, ministries of health and research funders pursuing 2019-nCoV critical animal health and public health research and the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, among other innovations. 
Participants will discuss several areas of research, including identifying the source of the virus as well as sharing of biological samples and genetic sequences. Experts will build on existing SARS and MERS coronavirus research and identify knowledge gaps and research priorities in order to accelerate scientific information and medical products most needed to minimize the impact of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.  
The meeting is expected to produce a global research agenda for the new coronavirus, setting priorities and frameworks that can guide which projects are undertaken first. “Understanding the disease, its reservoirs, transmission and clinical severity and then developing effective counter-measures is critical for the control of the outbreak, to reduce deaths and minimize the economic impact,” said Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, WHO Chief Scientist.
This will also fast-track the development and evaluation of effective diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines, while establishing mechanisms for affordable access to vulnerable populations and facilitating community engagement.
“The WHO R&D Blueprint is a global strategy and preparedness platform that drives coordinated development of drugs and vaccines before epidemics, and allows the rapid activation of R&D activities during epidemics. It speeds up the availability of the diagnostics, vaccines and treatments and technologies that ultimately save lives,” added Dr Michael Ryan, Executive Director, WHO Health Emergencies Programme.  
Setting clear global research priorities for the novel coronavirus should lead to more efficient investments, high-quality research and synergies among global researchers."

International donors have pledged around a quarter of the US$2 billion
                            the UN requested in the Global Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID-19 in
 March. 

Following is the text of the open letter: 

 
Dear donor community,

Humanity is collectively facing its most daunting challenge since the Second World War. COVID-19 knows
                            no borders, spares no country or continent, and strikes indiscriminately. By all accounts, we are at least 12 months away from a vaccine.

In this race against an invisible enemy, all countries must fight back,
                            but not all begin from the same starting line. In countries where the world’s most vulnerable need humanitarian aid and supplies to beat back the pandemic, cancelled flights and disrupted supply routes hit disproportionately
                            hard. It is in everyone’s interest to stop the virus from spreading unchecked, destroying lives and economies, and continuing to circle around the world.

The UN Secretary-General on 25 March launched the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan, requesting US$2 billion to boost the global response.
                            You have been fast and generous in your funding and have extended lifelines to those who were already caught up in war, poverty and the worst effects of climate change – especially at a time when your own populations
                            are suffering from the impact of the virus.

Around $550 million has generously been made available to implement the Plan so far, with significant additional resources being mobilized and pledged.

The
 Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has also released $95 million to kick-start the COVID-19 response, help contain the spread of the virus, maintain supply chains, and provide assistance and protection to the
                            most vulnerable people, including women and girls, refugees and internally displaced persons. But more needs to be done.

To get more deliveries off the ground, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) is setting up
                            the vital logistics backbone that will help save lives and help halt the spread of the virus. WFP now urgently needs additional funding to establish the necessary transport hubs, charter vessels and provide aircraft
                            for cargo, health workers and other essential staff.

All elements of the Global Humanitarian Response Plan are crucial and need continued funding, but without these logistics common services, the global response
                            could stutter to a halt. Now is not the time to slow down. No one is safe until everyone is safe.

We, humanitarian organizations from across the world, therefore, call upon you to urgently support this
                            global emergency supply system with an initial $350 million to enable a rapid scale-up of logistics common services.

These services, which WFP provides on behalf of the entire global humanitarian community, will
                            enable a swift, efficient response to COVID-19 for the most vulnerable people. Any delay in our action could undermine global efforts to bring the pandemic under control.

The scale-up of the COVID-19 services
                            includes:              • Establishing, equipping and managing international consolidation hubs and regional staging areas.              • Air and shipping cargo services.              • Passenger air services, with the necessary measures to avoid further spreading of the virus.              • Medical evacuation services for front-line workers.              • Infrastructure and construction of treatment centres.              • Real-time remote data collection.              • Critical investments required to safely deliver operations and services. Whatever it takes, we as humanitarians are determined to meet people’s urgent needs. The upscaling of the common services that we all depend on is crucial to enable us to meet these needs.

Every human
                            being, in every nation around the world, is facing the same mortal threat. Every step that speeds delivery, saves lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented all of humanity with a unique challenge, and only a uniquely
                            global response can halt its forward march.

Now is the time to step up together, to prevent needless suffering, and to fulfil the promise of a better future for all.

We hope to hear from you soon.

Health services, including national programmes to combat TB, need to be actively engaged in ensuring an effective and rapid response to COVID-19 while ensuring that TB services are maintained.   In the lead- up to World TB Day, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General emphasized in a news release, “COVID-19 is highlighting just how vulnerable people with lung diseases and weakened immune systems can be. The world committed to end TB by 2030; improving prevention is key to making this happen.”   WHO Global TB Programme, along with WHO regional and country offices, has developed an information note, in collaboration with stakeholders. This note is intended to assist national TB programmes and health personnel to urgently maintain continuity of essential services for people affected with TB during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by innovative people-centred approaches, as well as maximizing joint support to tackle both diseases.   “We stand in solidarity with those affected by COVID-19 and those at the frontlines of the fight to combat the disease,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of the WHO Global TB Programme. “We need to act with urgency to ensure that in line with our vision of Health for All, no one with TB, COVID-19 or any health condition will miss out on the prevention and care they need.

We need to immediately scale up all efforts to prevent the virus from infecting more people,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region.  Eight of the 11 countries of WHO South-East Asia Region have confirmed cases of COVID-19. While Thailand has 177 confirmed cases, Indonesia 134, India 125, Sri Lanka 19, Maldives 13, Bangladesh 5, Nepal and Bhutan one each. These numbers are increasing quickly. Looking at the numbers, some countries are clearly heading towards community transmission of COVID-19, the Regional Director said, adding this should best be prevented.  Of critical importance are continued efforts to detect, test, treat, isolate and trace contacts. Simple public health measures are critical. Practicing hand hygiene, covering your cough and sneeze, and practicing social distancing cannot be emphasized enough, Dr Khetrapal Singh said. “This alone has the potential to substantially reduce transmission.”"

NSAIDs include nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors (such as ibuprofen, aspirin (acetylsalicylate), diclofenac, and naproxen), as well as selective COX2 inhibitors (such as celecoxib, rofecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, and valecoxib).  Concerns have been raised that NSAIDs may be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects when used in patients with acute viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19.1,2 This review aimed to assess the effects of prior and current use of NSAIDs in patients with acute viral respiratory infections on acute severe adverse events (including mortality, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute organ failure, and opportunistic infections), on acute health care utilization (including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, supplemental oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation) as well as on quality of life and long-term survival.MethodsA rapid systematic review was carried out on 20 March 2020 on NSAIDs and viral respiratory infections using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and WHO Global Database. The review included studies conducted in humans of any age with viral respiratory infections exposed to systemic NSAIDs of any kind. All studies on COVID-19, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) were included irrespective of their sample size. Review of the evidenceA total of 73 studies were included (28 studies in adults, 46 studies in children, and one study in adults and children). All studies were concerned with acute viral respiratory infections or conditions commonly caused by respiratory viruses, but none specifically addressed COVID-19, SARS, or MERS. The review showed very low certainty evidence on mortality among adults and children.3 Effects of NSAIDs on the risk for ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke and myocardial infarction in adults with acute respiratory infections are unclear.4,5 Moderate to high certainty evidence showed little or no difference between ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) among children with fever with regard to effects on death from all causes, hospitalization for any cause, acute renal failure, and acute gastrointestinal bleeding.6-9 Most studies report that no severe adverse events occurred, or that only mild or moderate adverse events were observed. 10-13 There was no evidence regarding the effects of NSAID use on acute health care utilization, explicit quality of life measures, or long-term survival. LimitationsNo direct evidence from patients with COVID-19, SARS, or MERS was available. Therefore, all evidence included should be considered indirect evidence with respect to the use of NSAIDs prior to or during the management of COVID-19. Only one randomized controlled trial included a sufficiently large number of participants to identify rare severe adverse events. The remaining evidence derives from smaller randomized controlled trials, which are likely to be underpowered for detecting rare severe adverse events, and from case-control and cohort studies with methodological limitations. Studies included not only patients with confirmed viral respiratory infections and known pathogens, but also those with conditions commonly caused by respiratory viruses, such as upper respiratory tract infections and fever in children. It is likely that not all participants had viral respiratory infections. NSAIDs are a diverse set of drugs with different risk profiles for different populations and conditions. Not all studies distinguished between different types of NSAIDs. Some of the older studies are likely to have included patients taking specific NSAIDs that are no longer available owing to adverse effects. ConclusionAt present there is no evidence of severe adverse events, acute health care utilization, long-term survival, or quality of life in patients with COVID-19, as a result of the use of NSAIDs. References Russell B, Moss C, Rigg A, Van Hemelrijck M.

Distribution of the tests will help improve the global capacity to detect and respond to the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The test kit, called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel (CDC 2019-nCoV Real Time RT-PCR), is designed for use with an existing RT-PCR testing instrument that is commonly used to test for seasonal influenza.
The CDC 2019 novel coronavirus test is intended for use with upper and lower respiratory specimens collected from people who meet CDC criteria for 2019-nCoV testing. The test uses a technology that can provide results in four hours from initial sample processing to result.
“Our goal is early detection of new cases and to prevent further spread of the coronavirus,” said CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, M.D. “Distribution of these diagnostic tests to state laboratories, U.S. government partners and more broadly to the global public health community will accelerate efforts to confront this evolving global public health challenge.”
The test kit has not been FDA cleared or approved, however distribution and use of the test kits follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) February 4, 2020, issuance of an Emergency Use Authorizationexternal icon (EUA). The tests are being shipped through the International Reagent Resource (IRR)external icon, a CDC-established mechanism that distributes laboratory reagents domestically and globally.
Initially, about 200 test kits will be distributed to U.S. domestic laboratories and a similar amount will be distributed to select international laboratories. Each test kit can test approximately 700 to 800 patient specimens. Additional test kits will be produced and made available for ordering in the future from the IRR. At this time, each laboratory that places an order will receive one 2019-nCoV test kit.
The IRR is accepting orders for 2019-nCoV tests from qualified laboratories. This includes 115 qualified U.S. laboratories, such as state and local public health laboratories and Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories, as well as 191 qualified international laboratories, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance Response System (GISRS) laboratories.
This test is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of 2019-nCoV under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

Since 2012, the Tips campaign has profiled real people who are living with serious long-term health effects due to smoking cigarettes and secondhand smoke exposure.
New ads this year also show the impact of smoking on family members. Caring for a loved one with a smoking-related illness can affect the caregiver’s life in various ways, including their ability to work and maintain good physical and mental health.
“These powerful new stories from former smokers illustrate the impact of living with real-life health consequences from smoking and how their illnesses affect their loved ones,” said CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, M.D. “We are thankful to these brave individuals for sharing their stories, and we are proud to continue the Tips campaign which has helped so many people quit smoking.”
The new ads highlight the harms of smoking, including its damage to the people smokers love

Geri M., age 58, has smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and needs constant oxygen to help her breathe. She had to quit her job as a mail carrier because the activity became too difficult.
Michael F., age 57, has smoking-related COPD and relies on oxygen to help him breathe. He had to quit working at age 51 because of his illness. As COPD forces him to give up more and more of the activities he once loved, his world keeps shrinking.
Rebecca C., age 43, lost all five toes on her right foot to Buerger’s disease, a smoking-related condition that cut off the blood supply to her foot. She finally quit smoking before the disease damaged other parts of her body.
Tonya M., age 49, was diagnosed with heart failure at 38. She had to have a mechanical pump inserted inside her chest to help her heart pump blood throughout her body.
Asaad M., age 25, put his young life on hold to care for his mother, Leah, who was diagnosed with colorectal cancer from smoking.
Denise H., age 66, has spent more than 30 years caring for her husband, Brian, featured in previous Tips ads, who suffers from multiple health conditions as a result of his smoking.

Tips ads will run March 23 through October 4 on national cable and network television, streaming radio, and online. Hard-hitting mass media campaigns are scientifically proven to raise awareness about the dangers of smoking and to motivate people who smoke to quit for good. During 2012-2018, more than 16.4 million people who smoke have attempted to quit and approximately one million have successfully quit because of the Tips campaign.
Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Americans each year. Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body. For every person who dies because of smoking, at least 30 people live with a serious smoking-related illness.

1587581697-112,https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0117-evali-cases-decline.html,"January 17, 2020",CDC,News release,Most EVALI Patients Used THC-Containing Products as New Cases Continue To Decline,"CDC today released two reports on e-cigarette, or vaping, product use–associated lung injury (EVALI), confirming that most EVALI patients report using tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products and that new EVALI cases have continued to decline with time.
The two reports appear in CDC’s Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).
The first MMWR report updates EVALI patient demographic and self-reported substance use characteristics. As of January 14, 82% of EVALI patients nationwide with available data reported using any THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products, and 57% reported using any nicotine-containing products; 33% reported exclusive THC-containing product use, and 14% reported exclusive nicotine-containing product use.
The report also analyzed updated data on newly reported cases to CDC, as well as emergency department visits over time related to e-cigarette, or vaping, products. These data show that the EVALI outbreak began in June 2019 and peaked in September 2019. The number of cases has since continued to decline, but new cases and deaths continue to be reported.
“These reports build on the continued scientific progress CDC and our partners have made to reduce the number of EVALI cases,” said CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, M.D. “It is also critically important that we continue to do all we can do to protect Americans – particularly young people – from this serious health threat.”
The second MMWR report summarizes characteristics of EVALI patients in Illinois by substances used in e-cigarette, or vaping, products. The study found that while most Illinois EVALI patients reported use of THC-containing products, a small percentage had no evidence of any use of THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products.
Of 121 interviewed EVALI patients in Illinois, nine reported using only nicotine-containing products and had no indication of any THC use. These patients were more likely to be older and female than patients who reported using THC-containing products. These findings support earlier data suggesting that while THC containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products and vitamin E acetate play a major role in the outbreak, evidence is not sufficient to rule out the contribution of other chemicals of concern, including chemicals in either THC or non-THC products, in some of the reported EVALI cases.
A third CDC publication, a commentaryexternal icon, released today in New England Journal of Medicine, discusses key aspects of the EVALI outbreak and notes that it is distinct from the ongoing epidemic of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use among U.S. youth. This commentary also underscores that both the EVALI outbreak and youth-vaping epidemic warrant immediate, decisive, and science driven action to protect public health, and that the focus of these actions must target the underlying drivers.
The EVALI outbreak primarily affects young adults, is driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal sources and is strongly linked to vitamin E acetate. In contrast, the youth e-cigarette, or vaping, product use epidemic primarily affects adolescents, is driven by use of nicotine-containing products obtained mostly from formal sources, and has been caused by multiple factors, including advertising, attractive flavors – particularly in cartridge-based products, and the availability of easily concealable devices that deliver high levels of nicotine.
Current Recommendations from CDC and FDA

CDC and FDA recommend that people not use THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products, particularly from informal sources like friends, or family, or in-person or online dealers.
Vitamin E acetate should not be added to any e-cigarette, or vaping, products. Additionally, people should not add any other substances not intended by the manufacturer to products, including products purchased through retail establishments.
Adults using nicotine-containing e-cigarette or vaping products as an alternative to cigarettes should not go back to smoking; they should weigh all available information and consider using FDA-approved smoking cessation medications. They should contact their healthcare professional if they need help quitting tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, as well as if they have concerns about EVALI.
E-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults, or women who are pregnant. Adults who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using e-cigarette, or vaping, products.
THC use has been associated with a wide range of health effects, particularly with prolonged frequent use. The best way to avoid potentially harmful effects is to not use THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products.
Persons engaging in ongoing cannabis use that leads to significant impairment or distress should seek evidence-based treatment by a health care professional.

A new study finds that more than half of the time when children get into prescription pills, the medication had already been removed from the child-resistant container by an adult.
The findings come from a study of calls to five U.S. poison control centers by researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Emory University School of Medicine, and the Georgia Poison Center. The study appears this week in The Journal of Pediatricsexternal icon.
“These data suggest it may be time to place greater emphasis on encouraging adults to keep medicines in containers with child-resistant features,” says the study’s senior author, Daniel Budnitz, M.D., MPH, of CDC’s Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion. “There is an opportunity here for innovative medication container options that promote adult adherence and provide portability and convenience, while maintaining child safety.”
Child-resistant packaging keeps kids safe – but only when pills are inside 
The current study found four common scenarios in which young children get into prescription pills after the pills are out of their original containers:

Removed to remember to take as prescribed: Adults put pills into pill organizers that are not child-resistant.
Removed for ease of travel or transport: Adults put pills into baggies or other small containers that are not child-resistant to carry with them.
Removed for convenience: Adults leave pills out on countertops or on a bedside table for someone to take later.
Removed unintentionally: Adults sometimes spill or drop pills and may miss some when picking them up.

The most common scenarios varied by type of medication. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications (49%) and opioids (43%) were more often not in any container when found by young children. Diabetes drugs (34%) and cardiac medications (31%) were more often transferred to alternate containers such as pill organizers or baggies. Nonprescription medications were most often accessed from the original containers, but for many of these medications, child-resistant packaging is not required because of low potential for toxicity.
Grandparents’ pill organizers often involved
Investigators also asked whose pills the children were getting into. Most of the time, the children got into their parents’ pills. However, for some prescription medications that can be very harmful to young children in small amounts (e.g., diabetes or cardiac medications), over half belonged to grandparents. Therefore, it will be important to remind grandparents, as well as parents, about the importance of keeping medications up and away and out of the reach and sight of children.
CDC recommends keeping medications in the original child-resistant packaging. If one must remove pills from their original containers, a few precautions can help keep children safe:

Use a container that is child resistant.
Securely re-close the container after every use.
Put the container up and away and out of a child’s reach and sight immediately after every use.
Keep purses, other bags, or pockets with medicines in them up and away from young children.
If pills are spilled when taking or transferring medications, double-check to make sure that all pills are picked up.
Save the Poison Help number in your phone – (800) 222-1222 – and call right away if you think your child might have gotten into a medicine or a vitamin, even if you are not sure.

The patient recently returned from Wuhan, China, where an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by this novel coronavirus has been ongoing since December 2019.
The patient returned to the U.S. from Wuhan on January 13, 2020, and called a health care provider after experiencing symptoms a few days later.  The patient was admitted to a hospital, where infection control measures were taken to reduce the risk of transmission to other individuals. The patient remains hospitalized in an isolation room in stable condition and is doing well.
Based on the patient’s travel history and symptoms, health care professionals suspected 2019-nCoV. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC, where laboratory testing confirmed the infection. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) are investigating locations where this patient went after returning to Illinois and are identifying any close contacts who were possibly exposed.  The patient has limited close contacts, all of whom are currently well and who will be monitored for symptoms. Since returning from China, the patient has had very limited movement outside the home.
CDC is taking aggressive public health measures to help protect the health of Americans.  While CDC considers this a serious public health threat, based on current information, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is considered low at this time.  CDC is working closely with the Illinois Department of Public Health, the Chicago Department of Public Health, and other local partners. A CDC team has been deployed to support the ongoing investigation.
However, CDC has been proactively preparing for the introduction of 2019-nCoV in the U.S. for weeks, including:

First alerting clinicians on January 8 to be on the look-out for patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of travel to Wuhan, China.
Developing guidance for clinicians for testing and management of 2019-nCoV, as well as guidance for home care of patients with 2019-nCoV.
Has developed a diagnostic test to detect this virus in clinical specimens. Currently, testing must take place at CDC, but CDC is preparing to share these test kits with domestic and international partners.
Implementing public health entry screening at Atlanta (ATL), Chicago (ORD), Los Angeles (LAX), New York (JFK), and San Francisco (SFO) airports.  CDC is currently evaluating the extent and duration of this enhanced screening.
CDC has activated its Emergency Operations Center to better provide ongoing support.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing respiratory illness in people and others circulating among animals including camels, cats and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people, such as has been seen with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Investigations are ongoing to learn more, but person-to-person spread of 2019-nCoV is occurring.
It is likely there will be more cases reported in the U.S. in the coming days and weeks. CDC will continue to update the public as circumstances warrant.  While the immediate risk of this new virus to the American public is believed to be low at this time, there are simple daily precautions that everyone should always take.  It is currently flu and respiratory disease season, and CDC recommends getting vaccinated, taking everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed.  Right now, CDC recommends travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Wuhan, China. In addition, CDC recommends people traveling to China practice certain health precautions like avoiding contact with people who are sick and practicing good hand hygiene.

Physical inactivity for adults is defined as not participating in any leisure-time physical activities over the last month – activities such as running, walking for exercise, or gardening.
State and territory-level estimates of physical inactivity range from 17.3% of people in Colorado to 47.7% in Puerto Rico. In seven states and two territories (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Puerto Rico, and Guam), 30% or more of adults were physically inactive. By region, the South had the highest prevalence of physical inactivity (28%), followed by the Northeast (25.6%), Midwest (25%), and the West (20.5%).
“Too many adults are inactive, and they may not know how much it affects their health,” said Ruth Petersen, MD, Director of CDC’s Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity. “Being physically active helps you sleep better, feel better and reduce your risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers,”
The new maps are based on combined 2015-2018 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an on-going state-based telephone interview survey conducted by CDC and state health departments. This is the first time that CDC has created state maps of physical inactivity by race and ethnicity.
The demographics of physical inactivity
The maps point to notable differences in physical inactivity levels by race and ethnicity. Overall, Hispanics had the highest prevalence of self-reported physical inactivity (31.7%), followed by non-Hispanic blacks (30.3%) and non-Hispanic whites (23.4%).
In the majority of locations examined, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics had a significantly higher prevalence of inactivity than non-Hispanic whites.

Five states and Puerto Rico had a physical inactivity prevalence of 30% or higher among non-Hispanic white adults.
22 states and Puerto Rico had a physical inactivity prevalence of 30% or higher among Hispanic adults.
23 states and the District of Columbia had a physical inactivity prevalence of 30% or higher among non-Hispanic black adults.

Inactivity contributes to 1 in 10 premature deaths in the U.S. Inadequate levels of physical activity are associated with $117 billion in annual healthcare costs.
What more can be done?
CDC is working with communities and partners across the country as part of the Active People, Healthy NationSM initiative, to make it easier, safer, and more convenient for people to be active where they live, learn, work and play.  The overall goal of the initiative is to help 27 million Americans become more physically active by 2027 to improve overall health and quality of life and to reduce healthcare costs.
The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd editionexternal icon, recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. For example, this can be broken into smaller amounts such as 25 minutes every day or 30 minutes/five times a week.
Individuals and families are encouraged to build physical activity into their day by going for a brisk walk or a hike, walking the dog, choosing the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator, parking further away in the parking lot, walking or cycling to run errands, and getting off the bus one stop early and walking the rest of the way. The key is to move more and sit less.
The initiative helps community leaders take advantage of proven strategies to make physical activity safe and enjoyable for people of all ages and abilities. Building active and walkable communities may also help support local economies and create more cohesive communities.
Community leaders can also encourage school and youth physical activity programs, educate, and support families and individuals to be more active. They can create activity-friendly routes to everyday destinations such as home, work, school, and grocery stores. Together, leaders and community members can work with various populations to design and implement culturally-relevant solutions to reduce disparities in physical inactivity.

The report found that overall cancer death rates decreased in every racial and ethnic group during 2013–2017.
“The United States continues to make significant progress in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment,” said CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, M.D. “While we are encouraged that overall cancer death rates have decreased, there is still much more we can do to prevent new cancers and support communities, families, and cancer survivors in this ongoing battle.”
National Status of Cancer Report Findings
The data analyzed in the report combines cancer incidence data collected by CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, as well as mortality data from CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.
The report found that from 2013 to 2017:
Among men, death rates decreased for 11 of the 19 most common cancers, were stable for four cancers (including prostate), and increased for four cancers (oral cavity and pharynx, soft tissue including heart, brain and other nervous system, and pancreas).
Among women, death rates decreased for 14 of the 20 most common cancers, including the three most common cancers (lung and bronchus, breast, and colorectal), but increased for cancers of the uterus, liver, brain and other nervous system, soft tissue including heart, and pancreas. Rates were stable for oral cavity and pharynx cancer.
Overall cancer death rates among children ages 0 to 14 years decreased an average of 1.4% per year. Among adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 39 years, overall cancer death rates decreased an average of 1.0% per year.
Melanoma death rates decreased 6.1% per year among men and 6.3% per year among women.
Lung cancer death rates decreased 4.8% per year among men and 3.7% per year among women. However, lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer death, accounting for about one-fourth of all cancer deaths.
“The drops in mortality we’re seeing are real, sustained, and a strong indication of what we can do when we work to prevent and treat cancer,” said William G. Cance, M.D., ACS Chief Medical and Scientific Officer. “But we can and must do more, particularly to ensure everyone in the United States has access to the resources that are all too often benefitting only the most fortunate.”
For cancer incidence, notable findings include that from 2012 to 2016, incidence rates for all cancers combined were stable in men and increased slightly in women. In addition, rates of new cancers were stable among white men and decreased among black, Asian/Pacific Islander (API), American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), and Hispanic men.
“Thanks to advances brought about by basic research, we are making remarkable progress against cancer,” said NCI Director Norman E. “Ned” Sharpless, M.D. “This report provides further evidence that cancer death rates continue to decline. But we must not be complacent. The cancer incidence data—especially the increase in cancer among women—is a clear reminder that there is more work ahead.”
For the first time, the report provided rates and trends for the most common cancers among children (younger than 15 years) and among adolescents and young adults ages 15–39 years. Among children, overall cancer incidence rates increased an average of 0.8% per year during 2012 to 2016. The most common cancer types among children were leukemia, brain and other nervous system cancers, and lymphoma, with increasing incidence trends for each of these cancers during 2012 to 2016.
Among adolescents and young adults, overall cancer incidence rates increased an average of 0.9% per year from 2012 to 2016. The most common cancer among adolescents and young adults was female breast cancer; rates were highest among young black women.
“We look forward to improving surveillance of childhood cancers in the future by establishing specific databases for children to study these rare cancers. There are many unanswered questions in the realm of pediatric cancer and improving our tools to study them is essential to their ultimate prevention,” said NAACCR Director Betsy Kohler.
Progress Toward Cancer-Reduction Targets
In a companion paper to the report, researchers measured progress toward the federal government’s 10-year national objectives for improving Americans’ health, an effort known as Healthy People 2020. Specifically, researchers examined progress in four common cancers: lung, prostate, female breast, and colorectal.
Healthy People 2020 targets for reducing death rates were met for all cancers combined as well as for lung, prostate, female breast, and colorectal cancers overall¾although not in all individual sociodemographic groups. Despite some progress over the past decade, the report shows the need to address disparities in cancer screening and in certain risk behaviors.
Healthy People 2020 targets were not met for adults to decrease cigarette smoking; to increase smoking cessation success; to reduce excessive alcohol use; or to reduce obesity prevalence¾all behaviors linked to cancer risk.
Other findings on Healthy People 2020 targets include:
From 2008 to 2015, breast cancer screening rates increased slightly among Hispanic women but dropped among other groups, particularly Asian women, women in rural areas, and women with public or no health insurance.
The target for breast cancer screening of 81.1% was not met in any group except those with advanced educational degrees. Breast cancer screening rates were lowest among uninsured women.
There was some improvement in colorectal cancer screening rates, which increased about 20% overall between 2008 and 2017 but did not reach the target of 70.5%, except among those with advanced educational degrees.
Colorectal cancer screening increased by 35% or more in some groups, including AI/AN and Hispanic men and women, and men and women without health insurance.

1587581716-121,https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0318-data-show-changes-overdose-deaths.html,"March 18, 2020",CDC,News release,New Data Show Significant Changes in Drug Overdose Deaths,"Overall overdose death rates decreased by 4.1% from 2017 to 2018 in the United States. New CDC data show death rates involving heroin decreased by 4%, and prescription opioid-involved overdose death rates decreased by 13.5%.
“Decreases in overdose deaths involving prescription opioids and heroin reflect the effectiveness of public health efforts to protect Americans and their families,” said CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, M.D. “While we continue work to improve those outcomes, we are also addressing the increase in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids. We must bring this epidemic to an end.”
While progress has been made to combat overdose deaths, death rates involving synthetic opioids (excluding methadone) increased by 10% from 2017 to 2018.
The findings come from an in-depth Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis of the latest available drug overdose death data. The report published online today in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) analyzes changes in age-adjusted overdose death rates from 2017 to 2018 by demographic characteristics, county urbanization levels, U.S. Census region, and state. More than 750,000 Americans died from drug overdoses from 1999 to 2018.
“To sustain decreases and continue to prevent and respond to drug overdoses, specifically those involving synthetic opioids, it is critical to have a coordinated response,” said Debra Houry, M.D., M.P.H., director of CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. “Medical personnel, emergency departments, public health and public safety officials, substance abuse treatment providers, community-based organizations, and members of the community all play a role in addressing this complex and fast-moving epidemic.”
Synthetic opioid overdose deaths increased in 2018
Opioids were involved in more than 46,000 drug overdose deaths in 2018. Of the 39 jurisdictions included in the analyses, 11 states and the District of Columbia saw decreased rates of death involving opioids overall.
Synthetic opioids were involved in 31,335 overdose deaths — nearly half of all drug overdose deaths in 2018. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) likely drove the increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids (excluding methadone) from 2017 to 2018.
Synthetic opioid overdose-involved death rates increased from 2017 to 2018 among males and females, people age 25 years and older, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders.
Death rates from synthetic opioids also increased in large central metro, large fringe metro, medium metro, and small metro counties. The latest available data show synthetic opioid-involved overdose death rates increased in 10 states. The four states with the highest increases were Arizona, California, Washington, and Missouri. The rates increased in the Northeast, South, and West but remained stable in the Midwest.
“Opioid overdoses decreased from 2017 to 2018 but still remain high. Efforts must be strengthened to maintain and accelerate decreases in deaths involving prescription opioids and heroin and to prevent continued increases in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids,” said Nana Wilson, Ph.D., epidemiologist at CDC and lead author of this MMWR study.
The drug overdose crisis has evolved from 2017 to 2018
Preliminary successes in addressing the drug overdose crisis occurred during 2018. From 2017 to 2018, decreases occurred in all drug overdose deaths and in deaths involving all opioids, prescription opioids, and heroin. Efforts to improve opioid prescribing practices have increased and may have contributed to decreases in prescription opioid-involved overdose deaths.
Today’s findings suggest that factors that may be contributing to the decrease in heroin-involved deaths include reductions in the number of people initiating heroin use; shifts from a heroin-based market to a fentanyl-based market; increased treatment provision for people using heroin; and expansion of naloxone access.
Prescription opioid-involved overdose death rates decreased by 13.5% from 2017 to 2018. Rates decreased:

Among males and females
Among people age 15–64 years
Among non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives
Across all urbanization levels
In 17 states, prescription opioid-involved overdose death rates declined
In the Midwest, South, and West, but remained stable in the Northeast

Heroin-involved overdose death rates decreased by 4.1% from 2017 to 2018. Reductions occurred among males and females, persons aged 15–34 years, and non-Hispanic whites, and in large central metro and large fringe metro areas. Among the findings:

Rates remained stable in the Northeast and South, decreased in the Midwest, and increased in the West.
Rates decreased in seven states and Washington, D.C., and increased in three states.

Opioid-involved overdose death rates decreased among females, persons aged 15-34 years, 45-54 years, and non-Hispanic whites, and in small metro and nonmetropolitan areas. Findings note:

Rates increased among persons aged ≥65 years, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics.
Rates increased in the Northeast and the West and decreased in the Midwest and the South.
Rates decreased in 11 states and Washington, D.C., and increased in three states.

CDC is putting data to action 
CDC continues to work closely with other federal agencies to support the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Five-point Strategy to prevent and respond to drug overdoses, specifically those involving opioids. The Strategy provides better treatment, better data, better research, increased access to naloxone, and better pain management. Within HHS, CDC conducts surveillance and research; builds state, local, and tribal capacity for prevention; supports providers, health systems, and payers; partners with public safety; and empowers Americans to make safe choices.
CDC is working with states, territories, and cities and counties across the country to continue surveillance and prevention efforts. These efforts are to help inform and to sustain decreases and prevent continued increases through Overdose Data to Action, a 3-year cooperative agreement through which CDC funds health departments in 47 states, Washington, DC, two territories, and 16 cities and counties for surveillance and prevention efforts.
This report also reinforces the continued need for response strategies, including expanding the distribution of naloxone for overdose reversal, increasing the provision of medication-assisted treatment, enhancing public health and public safety partnerships, and enhancing linkage to treatment and harm reduction services. A comprehensive, multisectoral surveillance, prevention, and response approach remains critical for sustaining and expanding preliminary successes in reducing opioid-involved overdose deaths."
1587581724-125,https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0326-autism-prevalence-rises.html,"April 16, 2020",CDC,News release,Autism Prevalence Rises in Communities Monitored by CDC,"One in 54 8-year-old children have been identified with autism, according to an analysis of 2016 data published today in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Surveillance Summary.
This is higher than the previous estimate from 2014 data that found a 1 in 59 prevalence among 8-year-olds. The data come from 11 U.S. communities in CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. Data from 2016 also show that more children are being evaluated and identified with autism at younger ages. The latest findings draw on data from two separate reports on both eight-year-old and four-year-old children.
“Some of the increase in autism prevalence might be due to the way children are identified, diagnosed, and receiving services in their communities,” said Stuart Shapira, M.D., Ph.D., associate director for science at CDC’s National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. “The increase may also reflect reductions in racial differences in identification of autism, as this is the first ADDM Network report to identify black 8-year-olds with autism as having the same rates as white children.
Racial gap reduced but differences remain
Despite improvements in autism identification among black children, the analysis shows differences with other groups continue. Hispanic children are identified with autism at lower rates than black or white children. Also, black and Hispanic children identified with autism received evaluations at older ages than white children. This means black and Hispanic children with autism who do not have intellectual disability might not be identified at the same rates as white children.
Gender differences
Boys were more than four times as likely to be identified with autism as girls. However, girls identified with autism were more likely to have intellectual disability than boys (39% of girls vs. 32% of boys).
Geographic differences in autism prevalence
Autism prevalence in the 11 communities varied widely, from 1.3% in Colorado to 3.1% in New Jersey. This could be due to how autism is being diagnosed and documented. Some communities have a higher concentration of services for children with autism and their families. Also, some communities can review both health and educational records of children, which can lead to more children identified with autism.
Improvements in early identification of autism
A separate report looking at 4-year-old children finds substantial improvements have been made in the number of children who had their first developmental screening by the age of 36 months. According to the report, 84% of 4-year-olds had received a first developmental screening by 36 months of age compared to 74% in the previous report with 2014 data. This is important because the earlier that children are identified with autism, the sooner they can be connected to services that can improve outcomes and lead to a better quality of life.
ADDM Network
CDC’s ADDM Network is a tracking system that provides estimates of the prevalence and characteristics of autism among more than 300,000 8-year-old children in 11 communities in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. Data on 4-year-old children come from the Early ADDM Network, which is a subset of communities in Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.
The ADDM Network is the largest population-based program to monitor autism and the only autism tracking system that examines both health and education records. Because ADDM does not provide a representative sample of the entire United States, the combined prevalence estimates presented in today’s analysis cannot be generalized to all children aged 8 years in the United States.
What can parents do?
CDC’s Learn the Signs. Act Early program provides parents, childcare professionals, and healthcare providers with free resources, in English and Spanish, to monitor children’s development. The program offers parent-friendly, research-based milestone checklists for children as young as 2 months of age. CDC’s Milestone Tracker Mobile App can help parents track their child’s development and share the information with their healthcare providers. For more information visit www.cdc.gov/ActEarly.

1587581705-116,https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0130-coronavirus-spread.html,"January 30, 2020",CDC,News release,CDC Confirms Person-to-Person Spread of New Coronavirus in the United States,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today confirmed that the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has spread between two people in the United States, representing the first instance of person-to-person spread with this new virus here.
Previously, all confirmed U.S. cases had been associated with travel to Wuhan, China, where an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by this novel coronavirus has been ongoing since December 2019. However, this latest 2019-nCoV patient has no history of travel to Wuhan, but shared a household with the patient diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection on January 21, 2020.
Recognizing early on that the 2019-nCoV could potentially spread between people, CDC has been working closely with state and local partners to identify close contacts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases. Public health officials identified this Illinois resident through contact tracing. Both patients are in stable condition.
“Given what we’ve seen in China and other countries with the novel coronavirus, CDC experts have expected some person-to-person spread in the US,” said CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, M.D.  “We understand that this may be concerning, but based on what we know now, we still believe the immediate risk to the American public is low.”
Limited person-to-person spread with 2019-nCoV has been seen among close contacts of infected travelers in other countries where imported cases from China have been detected. The full picture of how easily and sustainably the 2019-nCoV spreads is still unclear. Person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum, with some viruses being highly contagious (like measles) and other viruses being less so.
MERS and SARS, the other two coronaviruses that have emerged to cause serious illness in people, have been known to cause some person-to-person spread. With both those viruses, person-to-person spread most often occurred between close contacts, such as healthcare workers and those caring for or living with an infected person. CDC has been proactively preparing for the introduction of 2019-nCoV in the U.S. for weeks, including:

First alerting clinicians on January 8 to be on the look-out for patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of travel to Wuhan, China.
Developing guidance for preventing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from spreading to others in homes and communities.
Developing guidance for clinicians for testing and management of 2019-nCoV, as well as guidance for infection control of patients hospitalized or being evaluated by a health care provider.

CDC is working closely with Illinois health officials and other local partners. A CDC team has been on the ground since the first 2019-nCoV-positive case was identified and is supporting an ongoing investigation to determine whether further spread with this virus has occurred.
It is likely there will be more cases of 2019-nCoV reported in the U.S. in the coming days and weeks, including more person-to-person spread. CDC will continue to update the public as we learn more about this coronavirus. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Right now, 2019-nCoV has not been found to be spreading widely in the United States, so CDC deems the immediate risk from this virus to the general public to be low. However, risk is dependent on exposure, and people who are in contact with people with 2019-nCoV are likely to be at greater risk of infection and should take the precautions outlined in CDC’s guidance for preventing spread in homes and communities.
For the general public, no additional precautions are recommended at this time beyond the simple daily precautions that everyone should always take. It is currently flu and respiratory disease season, and CDC recommends getting vaccinated, taking everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed. Right now, CDC recommends travelers avoid all nonessential travel to China.

This activity is in response to an outbreak in China caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (2019 nCoV), with exported cases to Thailand and Japan.
Starting January 17, 2020, travelers from Wuhan to the United States will undergo entry screening for symptoms associated with 2019-nCoV at three U.S. airports that receive most of the travelers from Wuhan, China: San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX) airports.
“To further protect the health of the American public during the emergence of this novel coronavirus, CDC is beginning entry screening at three ports of entry. Investigations into this novel coronavirus are ongoing and we are monitoring and responding to this evolving situation,” said Martin Cetron, M.D., Director of CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.
Based on current information, the risk from 2019-nCoV to the American public is currently deemed to be low. Nevertheless, CDC is taking proactive preparedness precautions.
Entry screening is part of a layered approach used with other public health measures already in place to detect arriving travelers who are sick (such as detection and reporting of ill travelers by airlines during travel and referral of ill travelers arriving at a US port of entry by CBP) to slow and reduce the spread of any disease into the United States.
CDC is deploying about 100 additional staff to the three airports (SFO, JFK, and LAX) to supplement existing staff at CDC quarantine stations located at those airports.
CDC is actively monitoring this situation for pertinent information about the source of outbreak, and risk for further spread through person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission. CDC may adjust screening procedures and other response activities as this outbreak investigation continues and more is learned about the newly emerging virus. Entry screening alone is not a guarantee against the possible importation of this new virus but is an important public health tool during periods of uncertainty and part of a multilayered government response strategy. As new information emerges, CDC will reassess entry screening measures and could scale activities up or down accordingly.
On Jan. 11, 2020, CDC updated a Level 1 Travel Health Notice (“practice usual precautions”) for travelers to Wuhan City and an updated Health Alert to health care professionals and public health partners with new and updated guidance is forthcoming.
China health officials report that most of the patients infected with 2019-nCoV have had exposure to a large market where live animals were present, suggesting this is a novel virus that has jumped the species barrier to infect people. Chinese authorities additionally report that several hundred health care workers caring for outbreak patients are being monitored and no spread of this virus from patients to health care workers has been seen. They report no sustained spread of this virus in the community, however there are indications that some limited person-to-person spread may have occurred. CDC is responding to this outbreak out of an abundance of caution, ready to detect people infected with 2019-CoV.

The patient recently returned from Wuhan, China, where an outbreak of pneumonia caused by this novel coronavirus has been ongoing since December 2019. While originally thought to be spreading from animal-to-person, there are growing indications that limited person-to-person spread is happening. It’s unclear how easily this virus is spreading between people.
The patient from Washington with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection returned to the United States from Wuhan on January 15, 2020. The patient sought care at a medical facility in the state of Washington, where the patient was treated for the illness. Based on the patient’s travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected this new coronavirus. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC overnight, where laboratory testing yesterday confirmed the diagnosis via CDC’s Real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test.
CDC has been proactively preparing for the introduction of 2019-nCoV in the United States for weeks, including:

First alerting clinicians on January 8, 2020, to be on the look-out for patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of travel to Wuhan, China.
Developing guidance for clinicians for testing and management of 2019-nCoV, as well as guidance for home care of patients with 2019-nCoV.
Developing a diagnostic test to detect this virus in clinical specimens, accelerating the time it takes to detect infection. Currently, testing for this virus must take place at CDC, but in the coming days and weeks, CDC will share these tests with domestic and international partners
On January 17, 2020, CDC began implementing public health entry screening at San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX) airports. This week CDC will add entry health screening at two more airports – Atlanta (ATL) and Chicago (ORD).
CDC has activated its Emergency Operations Center to better provide ongoing support to the 2019-nCoV response.

CDC is working closely with the state of Washington and local partners. A CDC team has been deployed to support the ongoing investigation in the state of Washington, including potentially tracing close contacts to determine if anyone else has become ill.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing respiratory illness in people and others circulating among animals including camels, cats and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people, such as has been seen with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). When person-to-person spread has occurred with SARS and MERS, it is thought to happen via respiratory droplets with close contacts, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. The situation with regard to 2019-nCoV is still unclear. While severe illness, including illness resulting in several deaths, has been reported in China, other patients have had milder illness and been discharged. Symptoms associated with this virus have included fever, cough and trouble breathing.  The confirmation that some limited person-to-person spread with this virus is occurring in Asia raises the level of concern about this virus, but CDC continues to believe the risk of 2019-nCoV to the American public at large remains low at this time.
This is a rapidly evolving situation. CDC will continue to update the public as circumstances warrant.

CDC scientists and partners found that 2.5 percent of 435 Egyptian rousette fruit bats tested from four districts in Sierra Leone tested positive for Marburg virus. Some of the infected bats had a strain similar to the one seen in Angola in 2005, thought to be the most virulent strain of Marburg virus that has emerged thus far. During the 2005 outbreak, 9 out of 10 people who contracted the virus died. In contrast, during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, 4 out of 10 people reported ill later died. Ebola and Marburg are in the same family of viruses.
This new study is the first time Marburg virus has been found in West Africa and the first time an Angola-like strain has been found in Egyptian rousette bats.
Actively infected bats can potentially spread the virus to people who interact closely with them, including eating them for food or eating fruit that’s been contaminated with infected bat saliva or urine. Egyptian rousette bats are a type of fruit bat that can carry Marburg virus. They eat many kinds of fruit, including types that are also preferred by people. To date, there have been no Marburg outbreaks in people in Sierra Leone. But the presence of the virus in bats means spillover to people is possible. CDC has been working closely with partners in Sierra Leone to educate residents how to live safely with Egyptian rousette bats and avoid becoming infected. Bats have important environmental benefits and the best way to prevent contracting Marburg infection is to avoid the bats and not injure or kill them, or consume partially eaten fruit.
The study, which is available hereexternal icon, was done in coordination partners at the Njala University in Sierra Leone, the One Health Institute at the University of California Davis, and their partner the University of Makeni, also in Sierra Leone."

This warning is in response to an ongoing outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spreading between people in many parts of that country.
Chinese health officials have reported thousands of 2019-nCoV cases in China, as well as severe illness including deaths. Sustained person-to-person community spread with this virus is reportedly occurring in China.
A number of travel-associated cases of 2019-nCoV infection also have been identified in other locations, including the United States. In other parts of Asia, some limited person-to-person spread has been detected among close contacts of travelers returning from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, however, community spread with this virus has not been reported in locations outside China.
In the United States, there have been 5 cases of 2019-nCoV detected in travelers returning from Wuhan. No person-to-person spread has been detected in the United States at this time and this virus is NOT spreading in the community.
While it’s possible that some person-to-person spread with this virus may be detected in the United States, the goal of the ongoing U.S. public health response is to contain this outbreak and prevent sustained spread in this country.
Based on current information, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is considered low at this time. However, risk is dependent on exposure and some people will have greater risk of infection, for example, healthcare workers caring for 2019-nCoV patients and other close contacts. CDC is aggressively responding to this serious public health situation to help protect the health of Americans. This response may cause disruptions in some people’s daily lives. This is unfortunate, but necessary to protect the health of Americans.

Key points:

As of January 15, 2020, this outbreak appears to be over.
CDC has lifted its advice that people avoid romaine lettuce from the Salinas Valley growing region in California. Contaminated romaine lettuce that made people sick in this outbreak is no longer available for sale.
A total of 167 people infected with the outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 were reported from 27 states.
Eighty-five people were hospitalized including 15 people who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. No deaths were reported.
Laboratory testing confirmed that this strain of Shiga-toxin producing E. coli 0157:H7 tends to cause more severe illness than other strains.
This outbreak was caused by the same strain of E. coli O157:H7 that caused outbreaks linked to leafy greens in 2017 and to romaine lettuce in 2018.
FDA continues to investigate the source of contamination. For more information about their investigation, visit https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-e-coli-romaine-november-2019external icon.

About Shiga toxin-producing E. coli:

People get sick from Shiga toxin-producing E. coli an average of 3 to 4 days after swallowing the germ. Most people get diarrhea (often bloody), severe stomach cramps, and vomiting.
Most people recover within a week, but some illnesses can last longer and be more severe.
Antibiotics are not recommended for patients with suspected E. coli infections until diagnostic testing can be performed and E. coli infection is ruled out.

Key points:

CDC is concerned that people who recently ate clover sprouts from a Jimmy John’s restaurant could develop a Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection.
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of E. coli O103 infections that have sickened 14 people in five states (Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Texas, and Utah). Clover sprouts from Jimmy John’s are a likely source of the outbreak.
Jimmy John’s reported that all of its restaurants stopped serving clover sprouts on February 24, 2020. Investigators are working to determine whether other restaurants or retailers received the same clover sprouts that are linked to illness.
This investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information becomes available.

Advice to consumers:

If you have leftovers with clover sprouts from Jimmy John’s, don’t eat them. Throw the leftovers away.
Talk to your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of an E. coli infection. Symptoms often include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting, and usually last 5-7 days.
Report your illness to your local health department. Assist public health investigators by answering questions about your illness.
Wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet and before and after preparing food to lower the chance of infecting others.

About E. coli infection:

People usually get sick from Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after swallowing the germ.
Some people with a STEC infection may get a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
Antibiotics are not recommended for patients with suspected E. coli infections until diagnostic testing can be performed and E. coli infection is ruled out.

These patients recently returned to the U.S. from Wuhan, China, where an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus has been ongoing since December 2019. This brings the total number of 2019-nCoV infections detected in the United States to five.
Based on the patient’s travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected 2019-nCoV. Clinical specimens were collected and sent to CDC, where laboratory testing confirmed infection with 2019-nCoV. Investigations are underway to determine where these patients went after returning to the United States and any close contacts who were possibly exposed. CDC teams have been deployed to support these efforts.
This is a rapidly evolving situation, and we are still in the early days of the investigation – both domestically and abroad. CDC continues to monitor the international situation with our teams on the ground in affected countries, as well as domestically in the four states with confirmed cases – Arizona, California, Illinois, and Washington. CDC is leaning forward with an aggressive public health response strategy and working closely with state and local public health authorities to identify potential cases early and make sure patients get the best and most appropriate care.
It is likely there will be more cases reported in the U.S. in the coming days and weeks, likely including person-to-person spread. In previous outbreaks with MERS and SARS, the two other coronaviruses that have jumped the species barrier to cause severe illness in people, person-to-person spread has been seen, including among healthcare workers caring for patients ill with coronavirus infection. This underscores the importance of appropriate precautions in the health care setting as well in homes of people who are infected with 2019-nCoV but who may not be hospitalized. CDC has developed guidance for both situations.
This is a very serious public health situation. We understand that some people are worried about this virus and how it may impact Americans. Outbreaks of new diseases are always of concern – and in today’s connected world, an outbreak anywhere can be a risk everywhere. Risk is dependent on exposure. Someone who is in close contact with a person who is infected with 2019-nCoV will be at greater risk of infection and should take the precautions outlined in CDC’s guidance for preventing spread in homes and communities. While this is a serious public health threat, CDC continues to believe the immediate risk to the U.S. general public is low at this time.
Right now, CDC recommends travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Hubei Province, China. In addition, CDC recommends people traveling to other parts of China practice certain health precautions like avoiding contact with people who are sick and practicing good hand hygiene.  For the general public, no additional precautions are recommended at this time beyond the simple daily precautions that everyone should always take. It is currently flu and respiratory disease season, and flu activity is still high and expected to continue for a number of weeks. CDC recommends getting a flu vaccine, taking everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed.

The patient is among a group of people under a federal quarantine order because of their recent return to the U.S. on a State Department-chartered flight that arrived on February 7, 2020.
All people who have been in Hubei Province in the past 14 days are considered at high risk of having been exposed to COVID-19 and subject to a temporary 14-day quarantine. This is the second person at this base who has tested positive for COVID-19. The first and second patients arrived on different planes and were housed in separate facilities; there are no epidemiologic links between them.
According to CDC on-site team lead Dr. Chris Braden, “At this time there is no indication of person-to-person spread of this virus at the quarantine facility, but CDC will carry out a thorough contact investigation as part of its current response strategy to detect and contain any cases of infection with this virus.”

This brings the total of number of COVID-19 cases in the United States to 14. There are likely to be additional cases in the coming days and weeks, including among other people recently returned from Wuhan. While 195 people were discharged from quarantine yesterday, more than 600 people who returned on chartered flights from Wuhan remain under federal quarantine.

Twenty-two of these cases are travel-related; 11 are believed to be person-to-person spread; and for the remaining 27 the source of exposure is still under investigation. Noteworthy developments in recent days include:

Floridaexternal icon announced its first and second presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, one in a person with recent travel history (to Italy), the other with no currently known travel or contact history.
Georgiaexternal icon announced its first and second confirmed cases of COVID-19, one is a person with recent travel history (to Italy), the other in a close contact of the first patient.
New Hampshireexternal icon also reported its first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in a person with recent travel history (to Italy).
New York stateexternal icon announced its first case of COVID-19 in a person with recent travel history (to Iran).
Rhode Island external iconannounced its first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in a person with recent travel history (to Italy).
Washington stateexternal icon announced more cases of COVID-19 associated with an outbreak in a long-term care facility. Washington has announced it now has 14 cases of COVID-19, including 6 COVID-19 deaths.

The 12 states that have reported cases include: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin.
As the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to expand and as testing capacity in the U.S. increases, CDC expects more cases to be detected across the country, including more instances of person-to-person spread in more states. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, a reportexternal icon out of China suggests serious illness occurs in 16% of cases. Older people and people with certain underlying health conditions like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example, seem to be at greater risk of serious illness.
The federal government has been working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to prepare for and respond to this public health emergency. CDC expects additional instances of person-to-person spread in the coming days and weeks.
Cases reported to CDC include those confirmed by CDC as well as presumptive positive cases reported by states. A presumptive positive result is when a patient has tested positive by a public health laboratory, but results are pending confirmation at CDC. For public health purposes, a presumptive positive result using the CDC test is treated as a positive.
CDC will report total presumptive and confirmed cases weekdays at noon. This number is based on all state reports received by 4 p.m. the previous day. CDC is no longer reporting number of persons-under-investigation (PUIs) nor those PUIs that test negative because now that states are testing and reporting their own results, these numbers would not be representative of the testing being done nationally. States are reporting results quickly and in the event of a discrepancy between CDC and state case counts, the state case counts should always be considered more up-to-date.

Coli,"A CDC food safety alert regarding a multistate outbreak of E. coli O103 infections has been posted: https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2020/o103h2-02-20/index.html
What is new:

Since the last update on February 26, 2020, 25 additional people infected with the outbreak strain of E. coli O103 have been reported from two states, bringing the total to 39 cases in six states (Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Texas, Florida, and Utah). Two people have been hospitalized.
Information gathered to date indicates that clover sprouts are a likely source of this outbreak.
On March 16, 2020, Chicago Indoor Garden recalled all products containing red clover sprouts.
CDC is advising consumers, restaurants, and retailers to not eat, serve, or sell recalled products containing sprouts from Chicago Indoor Garden.
This investigation is ongoing to determine where implicated sprouts and seeds have been distributed, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

Advice to consumers:

Do not eat recalled products containing sprouts from Chicago Indoor Garden. Recalled products have a “Best By” date of March 12, 2020. To view a full list of recalled products, see the FDA investigation noticeexternal icon.
If you have them, do not eat, sell, or serve them. Throw them away.
Children, older adults, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with diabetes, cancer, or HIV/AIDS, should avoid eating raw or lightly cooked sprouts of any kind (including alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean sprouts), because sprouts are a known source of foodborne illness.

About E. coli infection:

People usually get sick from Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after swallowing the germ.
Some people with a STEC infection may get a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
Antibiotics are not recommended for patients with suspected E. coli infections until diagnostic testing can be performed and E. coli infection is ruled out.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health officials in the state of Washington have reported three hospitalized patients who have tested presumptive-positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, including one patient who died.

Two of the patients are from a long-term care facility (LTCF) where one is a health care worker. Additional residents and staff of the LTCF who have not yet been tested for COVID-19 are reportedly either ill with respiratory symptoms or hospitalized with pneumonia of unknown cause.
The patient who died, a male in his 50s, was being treated at the same hospital. He was not a resident of the LTCF. CDC erroneously identified the patient as female in a briefing earlier today with the President and Vice President.

While there is an ongoing investigation, the source of these infections is currently unknown. Circumstances suggest person-to-person spread in the community, including in the LTCF.
CDC spokesperson Dr. Nancy Messonnier said, “Our hearts go out to the family of the patient who died as well as the families of the people who are caught up in this outbreak. The health of the residents, staff and community of this skilled nursing facility are a top priority. We will work with Public Health – Seattle and King County to support the care of the patients, the safety of the health care workers, and the well-being of the people in the surrounding community.”
This is the first reported death in the United States from COVID-19, as well as the first reported case in a health care worker and the first possible outbreak in a LTCF. These reports from Washington follow others of community spread in Oregon and two places in California earlier this week. While there is still much to learn about the unfolding situations in California, Oregon and Washington, preliminary information raises the level of concern about the immediate threat for COVID-19 for certain communities in the United States. Most people in the United States will have little immediate risk of exposure to this virus, but some people will be at increased risk depending on their exposures. The greatest risk is to those who have been in close contact with people with COVID-19. People with suspected or confirmed exposure should reach out to their state or local public health department.
CDC is sending a team of experts to support the investigation in Washington. Dr. Messonnier said, “We recognize that this is a difficult time; we are facing a historic public health challenge. We will continue to respond to COVID-19 in an aggressive way to contain and blunt the threat of this virus. While we still hope for the best, we continue to prepare for this virus to become widespread in the United States.”
These three cases bring the total number of COVID-19 cases detected through the U.S. public health system to 22. The federal government will continue to respond aggressively to this rapidly evolving situation
Testing for the virus that causes COVID-19 was conducted in Washington state using the CDC rRT-PCR. Results will be confirmed at CDC, but a presumptive positive result using the CDC test is treated as a positive for public health response purposes and a coordinated public health response has begun.

Indicators that track flu-like illness and deaths from pneumonia both elevated at this time
CDC is modifying existing surveillance systems to track COVID-19, and posted the first of what will be a weekly surveillance report called, “COVIDView.” The report, updated each Friday, will summarize and interpret key indicators, including information related to COVID-19 outpatient visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths, as well as laboratory data.
The first COVIDView shows:

Visits to outpatient providers and emergency departments for illnesses with symptom presentation similar to COVID-19 are elevated compared to what is normally seen at this time of year. At this time, there is little influenza (flu) virus circulation.
The overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate is 4.6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in persons 65 years and older (13.8 per 100,000) and 50-64 years (7.4 per 100,000). These rates are similar to what is seen at the beginning of an annual influenza epidemic.
The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) increased to 8.2% and is above the epidemic threshold of 7.2%. The percent of deaths due to pneumonia has increased sharply since the end of February, while those due to influenza increased modestly through early March and declined this week. This could reflect an increase in deaths from pneumonia caused by non-influenza associated infections, including COVID-19.
The National Center for Health Statistics is monitoring deaths associated with COVID-19. Those data are available beginning today and will be featured in this report next week.

COVIDView specifically reports the following:

Virus information: This includes COVID-19 diagnostic testing data provided by public health and clinical laboratories. For example, COVIDView will include the percentage of respiratory specimens collected from patients that test positive for SARS-COV-2.
Outpatient and Emergency Department Visits: This is syndromic (i.e., not laboratory confirmed disease) data and will be reported as the percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) or COVID-19-like illness (CLI) nationally and in each of the 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) surveillance regions across the country. This data is provided through two surveillance systems: the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like-illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) and the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP).
Severe Disease Information: This includes information on COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths. The hospitalization data is provided by COVID-NET, which conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among children and adults through a network of over 250 acute care hospitals in 14 states. Mortality data is provided by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which reports provisional death counts based on death certificate data received and coded by the National Center for Health Statistics. COVID-NET hospitalization data and NCHS mortality data are summarized in COVIDView each week, but they also each have a webpage where this data is posted (links provided below).
Additional surveillance systems and data sources, including expansions of the currently launched systems and sources of data, will be added over time.

California has announced a second possible instance of community spread.
Oregon has announced its first possible instance of community spread.
The state of Washington has announced two presumptive cases. One is likely travel related. The other is the state’s first possible instance of community spread.

Community spread means spread of an illness for which the source of infection is unknown. One previous possible instance of community spread was announced in California on February 26.
The four patients tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 in their respective states using the CDC-developed rRT-PCR. They are considered presumptive positive cases pending CDC confirmatory testing. However, CDC and State and local public health authorities are proceeding with public health investigations and response activities as if these were confirmed cases.
With both confirmed and presumptive positive cases, CDC recommends healthcare providers follow the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
These four cases bring the total number of COVID-19 cases detected through the U.S. public health system to 19.
The federal government has been working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat. Unprecedented, aggressive efforts have been taken to contain the spread and mitigate the impact of this virus.

While the quarantine potentially conferred a significant public health benefit in slowing transmission, CDC’s assessment is that it may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship. CDC believes the rate of new reports of positives new on board, especially among those without symptoms, highlights the high burden of infection on the ship and the potential for ongoing risk. Therefore, to protect the health of the American public, all passengers and crew of the ship have been placed under travel restrictions, preventing them from returning to the United States for at least 14 days after they had left the Diamond Princess.
Currently, there are more than 100 U.S. citizens still onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship or in hospitals in Japan. These citizens have been placed under the restrictions, as have the ship’s other passengers and crew.
After disembarkation from the Diamond Princess, these passengers and crew will be required to wait 14 days without having symptoms or a positive coronavirus test result before they are permitted to board flights to the United States.
If an individual from this cruise arrives in the United States before the 14-day period ends, they will still be subject to a mandatory quarantine until they have completed the 14-day period with no symptoms or positive coronavirus test results.
Because of their high-risk exposure, CDC expects there will be additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the remaining passengers on board the Diamond Princess.
CDC is committed to protecting the health and safety of all Americans. We continue to believe that the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to the general public in the United States is currently low. The U.S. Government is taking these measures to protect the Diamond Princess passengers and crew, their loved ones, the traveling public, and communities within the United States."

Good afternoon and thank you all for standing by.  At this time, I would like to inform all participants that your lines will be on a listen-only mode until the question and answer session of today’s call.  Today’s call is being recorded.  If there are any objections, you may disconnect at this time.  I will now turn the call over to Benjamin Haynes.  Sir, you may begin.
Thank you, Christie.  Thank you all for joining us today for this briefing to update you on CDC’s COVID-19 response.  We are joined today by Dr.  Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s national immunization and respiratory diseases center.  I will turn the call over to the Dr.  Messonnier.
Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us.  While it has only been 24 hours since we spoke last, we wanted to share the latest information we have.  I am joined by representatives from the state of Washington today to announce an additional three new cases in people who tested presumptive positive in the state.  Sadly, this includes the first reported death in the United States from COVID-19 as well as the first reported case in a health care worker and the first possible outbreak in a skilled nursing facility.  These reports from the state of Washington follow others of community-spread in Oregon and two places in California earlier this week.  This brings to 22 the number of cases in the U.S.  that have been detected by our public health system.  We are still early in the investigations in California, Oregon and Washington.  However, this preliminary information raises our level of concern about the immediate threat for COVID-19 for certain communities in the United States.  One thing that has not changed is that most people in the U.S. will have little immediate risk of exposure to the virus.  However, some people will be at increased risk depending on their exposure.  The greatest risk is to those who are close contacts with people with COVID-19.  People with suspected or confirmed exposure should reach out to their health care provider.  CDC is deploying a team to support the ongoing investigation in the state of Washington as well as another team to California to support their response.  We are working hard to find and identify how the patients were exposed as well as doing extensive contact tracing of people who were exposed or who might have been exposed.  I would like to turn the call over now to Dr.  Kathy Lofy, the state of Washington — I’m sorry, the state of Washington state health officer to tell you more about the cases and the investigation being done.
Nancy, this is Jeff Duchin, the health officer for public health, Seattle in King County.  If it is okay with you, I will speak before Nancy.
Before Kathy?  Of course.
Is that okay?
Of course.
Thank you.  So public health Seattle and King  County has three new presumptive cases of COVID-19 including one person who died, and we all here are working on the public health response, we want to send our sincere condolences to the families and loved ones of the person who died.  None of us want to see this although we understand it can be a severe disease.  Two of the confirmed cases are associated with a long-term care facility called Life Care Kirkland in our County.  One is a health care worker, a woman in her 40s, who is satisfactory condition at Overlake Hospital.  She has no known travel outside the United States.  The second case is a woman in her 70s, a resident of the long-term care facility and she is in serious condition at another one of our local hospitals, Evergreen Hospital.  We are aware of a number of other individuals associated with the long-term care facility who are also reportedly ill with respiratory symptoms, and we are in the middle of an investigation to understand more about the situation, and we will continue to update our partners and the public as new information emerges over the coming days.  We would not be surprised to find additional cases.  The death occurred in a patient at Evergreen Health Hospital.  This patient had underlying health conditions but was not associated with the long-term care facility.  We’re currently working with the long-term care facility to provide care for the ill patients and try and prevent the spread to other patients in the facility.  We’re very grateful for the support we’re receiving from our colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control who are sending a team to us tonight to help support our efforts to identify, isolate and test all of those who may be at risk because of these new cases.  At this point I’m going to stop and turn the call over to my colleague, Kathy Lofy, the state health officer for Washington state.
Thank you, Dr.  Duchin.  Any name is Dr.  Kathy Lofy, the state health officer at the Washington state department of health.  I want to begin by echoing the sentiments of those who spoke before me.  We all send ore deepest condolences to the family of the person who died.  We want to extend our support to health care workers caring for impacted people at the facility where COVID-19 has been confirmed.  The COVID-19 situation is evolving rapidly on a global scale, and in Washington we are starting to see some spread in the community.  Therefore, we feel the risk to the public is increasing.  That means it is more important than ever to practice good health habits like washing your hands and staying home from school or work when you are sick.  Should we start to see more spread in Washington, we might consider recommending measures like cancelling large public events.  Now that we can test for COVID-19 at our state public health laboratory in Shoreland, we are able to get the test results much faster.  This will allow us to identify cases and offer key guidance to communities in a more timely fashion.  In closing it is important for people to remember most people with COVID-19 have mild illness.  A smaller proportion of people will have severe illness, and that’s why we are working extremely hard in Washington to decrease the spread as much as we can.  With that I will turn it back over to you, Dr.  Messonnier.
Thank you both.  I want to take a moment to thank our colleagues in the state of Washington at the state and local level.  Also, I would like to thank all of the states and clinicians who reached out to us to discuss potential cases.  Since the beginning CDC’s testing criteria allowed for clinical discretion.  As public health professionals we know there is no substitute for the astute clinician on the front line of patient care.  I have said that with our enhanced surveillance and detection capacity, especially as more state and local public health labs come on line, we expect to find more cases of envelope coronavirus in the U.S.   Further, newly manufactured kits have been provided for distribution, combined with other reagents that CDC has procured it is enough to test 75,000 people.  Earlier this week we discussed if the virus gains a foothold in the U.S.  communities may need to take local action to plan and respond.  What these actions look like at the community level will vary depending on local conditions.  What is appropriate for one community seeing local transmission won’t necessarily be appropriate for a community where no local transmission has occurred.  We would like to empower local communities in coordination with their public health professionals to make the decisions that work for them.  The practical measures they may enact are to help limit exposure by reducing face-to-face contact and preventing spread among people in community settings.  This is called social distancing.  I want to recognize that people are concerned about the situation.  We appreciate that Americans are taking this threat seriously and continuing to seek information about how to be prepared.  As always, our number one priority is the health and safety of the American public.  Our mission includes providing you with clear information that allows you to make decisions about how best to protect yourself and your family.  We recognize that this is a difficult time.  We are facing an historic public health challenge.  We will continue to respond to COVID-19 in an aggressive way to contain and block the threat this virus poses.  While we still hope for the best, we continue to prepare for this virus to become more widespread in the United States.  Before I close I want to say that while there is some spread in some communities, there is not national spread of COVID-19.  CDC and the federal government are working to keep it that way.  However, you can also do your part.  Remember to take everyday preventive actions like washing your hands.  And if you are sick, covering your cough and staying home to the greatest extent possible.  We would be happy to take some questions now.
Christie, we are ready to open up for questions.
Thank you.  At this time I would like to ask all parties that if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your touch tone phone.  Please ensure that your phone is unmuted and state your name clearly when prompted.  Again, please press star one to ask your question.  If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star two.  One moment.  Our first question comes from Lisa Krieger of San Jose Mercury News.  Your line is open.
Yes, thank you.  I wondered if you would describe why some patients are more severely affected than others?  What are the risk factors and do we understand the underlying biology there?
This is CDC.  I will start.  The data is pretty consistent, both from China and from other countries, that people who are having the most severe impact of this disease are those who are older, those who are medically fragile, for example with underlying medical conditions.  That is generally sort of consistent with what we generally see with other viral respiratory infections.  In the United States right now, as we have talked about, many of the cases are either recovered or recovering, and, Dr. Duchin and Dr. Lofy, do you want to talk more specifically about your patients in Washington state?
Thank you, Dr. Messonnier.  This is Dr.  Jeff Duchin from public health in King County.  The cases that we just discussed with both in high-risk groups for serious complications from COVID-19, which are very similar to the risk groups that are at serious complications for seasonal influenza.  One of our patients was in her 70s, the other one had significant chronic underlying health conditions.  So we do recognize that the vast majority of people who become infected with this virus will do well and have a mild infection and do not need to seek health care.  It can be very serious in people who are vulnerable, the older adults and those who have underlying health conditions.
Next question, please.
Thank you.  The next question comes from novel chic (?) of the New York Times.  Your line is open.
I’m wondering how concerned we should be about the case has were detected in the nursing facility, especially since we know that more severe cases of COVID-19 occur in people who are older and have other health conditions, which presumably other people at this facility would be more vulnerable because of that?
Dr.  Duchin, I think it goes to you.
We are very concerned about an outbreak in a setting where there are many older people, as we would be wherever people who are susceptible might be gathering.  For that reason, you know, we really want to emphasize that older adults, adults with chronic underlying health conditions — and I’m talking about the same conditions that we’re used to hearing about with seasonal influenza, chronic cardiac disease, lung disease, diabetes and other conditions that might weaken the immune system, should be really clear and understand the importance of taking the steps that we’re recommending to protect themselves, both with the hand washing, more hand washing, less face touching, and avoiding contact with others, particular others who might be ill, and trying to practice good social distancing as much as possible at this time to decrease their risk as much as possible.
Thank you, Dr. Duchin.   CDC’s perspective, I would again reiterate that while the overall risks to Americans are low, we recognize that these populations of people who are medically fragile would be at higher risk if there is transmission in their communities.  If you fall into one of those groups of folks who are medically fragile and you are having respiratory symptoms, please reach out to your health care provider to get advice that is specific for you.
Next question, please.
Thank you.  Our next question comes from Helen Branswell of STAT.  Thank you.  Your line is open.
Hi.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  Dr.  Duchin, if I could ask you a question, please.  I think you said that the death was not the person in the long-term care facility.  Is there any link to that long-term care facility in that patient?  How — do you have a sense how or where the patient was infected?
Thanks, Helen, for that question.  That’s the kind of thing that we’re trying to answer right now.  We just became aware of this situation recently, and we’re doing an investigation as we speak to try to understand all of the potential exposures that that patient may have had and if there is any potential commonalities with anyone else that might have been at the long-term care facility.  But at this point we don’t have links.
Thank you.
Next question, please.
Thank you.  Our next question comes from Azine Garoshi of Buzzfeed News.  Your line is open.
Hi.  I just wanted to get a little bit more information about the others who are ill at the long-term care facility.  How many of them are there that are currently being monitored and are they going to be tested as well?
Thank you for that question.  This is Jeff Duchin from public health, Seattle, King County.  So I just want you to understand the situation is evolving.  We are continuing to gather information, and I will tell you what we know at this time.  Approximately — well, there are about 100 — a little over 100, approximately 108 residents at the facility and about 180 staff.  Among the residents we have had reports that approximately 27 have some sort of symptoms, and among the staff approximately 25.  We’re going to be working  in collaboration with our CDC team, which will be arriving tonight, to assess each and every one of these people and provide the appropriate guidance around isolating and all of these people will be tested and at a minimum — we will take every step to minimize exposure of others.  At this point the investigation is just getting started so I don’t have more details for you.
Next question, please.
Thank you.  The next question is from Sarah Overmore.  Your line is open.
Yes, thank you.  I wanted to ask, there’s been conflicting reports about who died, whether they’re a man or a woman, what their age was.  I was wondering if you could give us information on that, at least on their age.  Also, are you working to isolate people that have had contact with people who are sick or the one that has died and also did the lack of testing capabilities delay finding out who these cases were, particularly the person who died?
Okay.  Thank you for those questions.  Again, Jeff Duchin, public health, Seattle and King County.  I’m sorry again to confirm that we had a death in a man in his 50s who had underlying health conditions.  You know, this patient was tested because we recently acquired the — well, I should say the patient was tested locally at our Washington state public health lab that recently acquired the test kits, and this patient was eligible for testing because of very recent criteria that were put out by the Centers for Disease Control that our health care providers became aware of.  So, you know, if we had the ability to test earlier, I’m sure we would have identified patients earlier in the community, possibly at hospitals, but we were also looking at not only availability of testing but whether patients met criteria for testing.  So given the fact that we just recently acquired our availability of testing and new criteria were published, this person was brought to our attention.
Thank you.
Next question, please.
Thank you.  The next question comes from Josh Bevis of CNN.  Your line is open.
Thank you.  This question is for Dr.  Duchin.  14% of recovered coronavirus patients in China ‘s Guangdong tested positive again.  CDC has been denying this fact.  Are you still denying it or are you recognizing the possibility of the disease coming back in cured patients and how are you planning for that?
I’m sorry.  Will you repeat that?  Sorry, go ahead.
I will briefly answer and ask Dr.  Messonnier to comment.  I do not have firsthand knowledge of the literature from China.  I am familiar with social media reports that describe what you mentioned about reinfection, however, it is not clear to me that’s actually the case.  It is not clear to me that those persons ever cleared the infection or have residual shedding of virus, and it is not clear that that residual shedding even represents transmission potential.  So I’m going to limit my comments to that because it is not something germane to my work here locally and ask Dr.  Messonnier if she has something to add.
You know, thank you, Dr.  Duchin.  You know, I would say it is really important for the global community to get access to scientific information as quickly as possible and in real-time because the information from one country can definitely help others who are making decisions about their patients.  But in the rush to push out information quickly, there have been some instances already where there hasn’t been appropriate scientific review of some of the data that’s coming out, and that is an essential part of any investigation to have appropriate review.  We are really focused on the U.S. cases, and we follow those cases closely to look at their clinical status but also to look at whether or not they continued to harbor the virus in their nose and throat.  With such a limited number of cases in the U.S., we have been able to be very aggressive about that, and we have not seen any sign yet of the phenomenon that you are mentioning about reinfection.  When we gather additional data or find that it is going to impact care in the U.S., we will certainly make that clear, but it is not something that we’re seeing here and it has not changed our clinical practice.
Next question, please.
Thank you.  The next question comes from Janell Alacka of Kaiser Health News.  Your line is open.
Hi.  Thank you for taking the question.  Hey, Dr. Duchin, nice to talk to you.  I wonder when you say you are working  with the long-term care facility to try to prevent the spread, what exactly can be done in kind of a contained facility like that where the people live to prevent the spread of such a transmissible illness?  Then I have one other question about the patient who died.
Okay.  Hi, Janell.  Thanks for your question.  So what we’re doing, of course, initially consultation with our colleagues, infection control experts at the CDC to provide guidance to the facility about infection control measures in the facility such as cohorting ill patients from well patients, the use of personal — appropriate use of personal protective equipment and including eye protection, which isn’t something that’s commonly used in these types of settings, and the need to test and identify patients who are positive so that they can be cohorted away from patients who might be negative.  But it is a very challenging environment, particularly with so many vulnerable patients, to manage an outbreak.  So we’re going to send a team into the facility tomorrow to do an assessment, to work with health care providers there to try to understand what the actual situation is to the greatest degree possible and provide additional guidance based on what we see, but we haven’t been on site yet.
I see.  And then just to clarify, you know, President Trump said that the person who died in Washington state was a woman in her 50s with underlying health conditions, and I think I heard you say that it was a man.  So can we just clarify who the person who unfortunately died actually was?
It was a male, not a woman, in his 50s.
In his 50s.  And not a patient who had been previously been identified as a case?
This case was reported to us yesterday from the Washington state public health laboratory as a presumptive positive and confirmation pending. First we heard about it, the positive, was yesterday.
Next question, please.
Thank you.  Our next question comes from Molly McCria of CPIX news of San Francisco.  Your line is open.
Yes, hi.  Thank you for taking the calls and the questions.  Any updates on the patients that we have and the patient in Solana County or the patient announced yesterday in Santa Clara County, in progress in terms of doing the tracing, the contact tracing?
This is CDC.  My request would be that you direct those questions to the California state health department.  They’re better equipped to answer questions about their investigations and their patients.
Christie, we have time for one more question.
Thank you.  Our next question comes from Karen Weintraub of Scientific American.  Thank you, your line is open.
Thanks for taking my question.  I was wondering what you think other long-term health care facilities should be doing now?  Should they prevent visitors from coming in?  Is there anything that should be done or considered?  I know you’re not trying to tell everybody what to do, but other facilities around the country?
This is CDC and I will answer for around the country and see if Dr. Lofy or Dr. Duchin want to talk specifically about Washington state.  As I said, right now we still judge the general risk to the American public to be low, and that includes residents of long-term care facilities.  However, as you have heard, in general those that are older and that are medically fragile would be at higher risk if there was a spread in a community.  There are general common sense measures that we ask long-term care facilities to do to make sure to protect their residents, and they are the same things that we’ve been talking  about, washing hands, identifying people who are sick early to make sure that they get appropriate medical care.  And when somebody is sick, trying to keep them from infecting others.  Those are common sense approaches that we would recommend in any time when there is transmission of an infectious disease.  Like everywhere in the country, we are recommending that people think through what they might do if there is a risk in their community, not that those should be — that they should be taking those measures, but that it is part of general preparedness.  It is good to have those conversations in advance so that if you do need to act you are ready to do it.  Dr.  Lofy and Dr.  Duchin, I don’t know if you want to talk specifically about what you are telling folks in long-term care facilities in Washington.
Thank you.  This is Jeff Duchin, public health, Seattle, King County. I think everything Dr.  Messonnier mentioned that we’re reminding the importance of making sure health care workers that are ill don’t come to work and try to screen visitors who are ill.  We don’t want patients who are in these facilities exposed to coughing and sneezing.  Visitors during flu season or when there’s a potential for COVID-19 to be in the community.  So really sort of souping up our influenza prevention guidance to be relevant to this situation.  That’s the foundation at this point.
Thank you, Dr.  Duchin.  This is Dr.  Messonnier.  Thank you for reminding me to say again that our public health professionals also always want to make the importance of health care providers who are on the front lines of care of patients in any such outbreak, and we continue to reiterate the importance of making sure we keep them safe so they continue to do their jobs.
Thank you, Dr.  Messonnier, Dr.  Duchin and Dr.  Lofy.  Please check the COVID-19 website for the latest updates.  I would like to mention that the state of Washington will be hosting a press briefing at 4:00 p.m. Eastern to provide more information on their local response.  If you have further questions, please call the main media line at 404-639-3286 or e-mail media@CDC.gov.  Thank you.
Thank you.  This does conclude this day’s conference.  You may disconnect at this time.  Thank you and have a good weekend."

>> THANK YOU, MICHELLE.  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FOR THIS BRIEFING.  TO UPDATE YOU ON CDC’S COVID-19 RESPONSE.  WE ARE JOINED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE CDC CENTER FOR IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES WHO WILL GIVE OWNING REMARKS BEFORE TAKING YOUR QUESTIONS.  I WILL TURN THE QUESTION OVER TO DR. MESSONNIER.
>> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.  SINCE WE BRIEFED YOU LAST THERE’S ONE MORE CONFIRMED CASE OF COVID-19 IN A PERSON WHO HAD BEEN UNDER QUARANTINE FACILITATED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT AT JOINT BASE LACKLAND.  THERE ARE MORE THAN 600 PEOPLE STILL UNDER QUARANTINE IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THEIR RECENT RETURN FROM THE EPICENTER OF THIS OUTBREAK IN CHINA.  IN GENERAL, OUR GUIDANCE IS BASED ON RISK ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER PEOPLE OR GROUPS MAY HAVE DIFFERENT RISKS.  AND THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT NOW.  BEING QUARANTINED CAN BE DISRUPTIVE, FRUSTRATING AND FEEL SCARY.  ESPECIALLY WHEN THE REASON FOR THE QUARANTINE IS EXPOSURE TO A NEW DISEASE FOR WHICH THERE MAY BE LIMITED INFORMATION.  QUARANTINE IS AN UNUSUAL SITUATION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONDERS TOO.  THE LAST TIME WE HAD TO QUARANTINE LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE WAS MORE THAN 50 YEARS AGO.  SO WHILE WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN, THERE ARE GOING TO BE BUMPS ALONG THE WAY.  I UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS THAT HAS COME UP INVOLVES QUESTIONS ABOUT TESTING AND WHEN PEOPLE SHOULD BE TESTED.  I WANT TO SAY RIGHT NOW CDC’S RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE POLICIES WE ARE FOLLOWING ACROSS THE BOARD IS TO TEST PEOPLE WITH THE HISTORY OF EXPOSURE WHO ARE SHOWING SYMPTOMS.  THIS IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TESTING PEOPLE TOO EARLY CAN POTENTIALLY MISS INFECTIONS.  PEOPLE WITH STILL LATER BECOME SICK.  LET ME EXPLAIN.  THE OUTER BOUND OF THE INCUBATION PERIOD WE’RE USING FOR THIS NOVEL CORONAVIRUS IS 14 DAYS.  THAT MEANS WE EXPECT SOMEONE WHO IS INFECTED TO HAVE SYMPTOMS SOME TIME DURING THOSE 14 DAYS.  KNOW, AS SOMEONE IS EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS THAT MIGHT NOT SHOW SYMPTOMS RIGHT AWAY AND TESTING ON DAY ONE OR TWO OR THREE MIGHT PRODUCE A NEGATIVE RESULT.  HOWEVER, IT COULD MEAN THE VIRUS HASN’T ESTABLISHED ITSELF SUFFICIENTLY IN THE SYSTEM TO BE DETECTED BY TEST.  IT’S NOT A QUESTION OF THE ACCURACY OF THE TEST.  THE TEST WE’RE USING AT CDC IS VERY SENSITIVE.  IT’S A QUESTION OF WHEN THE VIRUS BECOMES DETECTABLE IN THAT PERSON.  SO IF A PERSON TESTS NEGATIVE ONCE, IT’S NOT CLEAR THAT IT’S A TRUE NEGATIVE.  THE TEST DOESN’T INFORM PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS OR CLINICAL CARE.  IN FACT, IN NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS COULD PROVIDE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY.  WITH THE INCUBATION PERIOD BEING UP TO 14 DAYS, ONE TEST AT A GIVEN POINT IN TIME ONLY TELLS YOU IF SOMEONE IS INFECTED AT THAT ONE MOMENT.  CDC DID TEST ALL OF THE INITIAL 195 PEOPLE WHO RETURNED FROM WUHAN ON JANUARY 29th.  BUT SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW THE VIRUS BEHAVES IN PEOPLE AND WHEN IS THE OPTIMAL TIME TO TEST THEM TO BEST INFORM OUR PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE.  CDC MAY DO TESTING OF ALL PEOPLE AGAIN IF THE RISK WARRANTS IT.  BUT RIGHT NOW, CDC STAFF AT EACH BASE ARE CHECKING TEMPERATURES TWICE DAILY AND MONITORING PEOPLE FOR ANY NEW SYMPTOMS.  IF SOMEONE HAS SYMPTOMS COMPATIBLE WITH THIS NEW VIRUS THEY’RE MEDICALLY EVALUATED AND THEY’RE TESTED.  ANOTHER QUESTION I WANT TO ADDRESS IS HOW THIS VIRUS SPREADS.  BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW NOW, WE BELIEVE THIS VIRUS SPREADS MAINLY FROM PERSON TO PERSON AMONG CLOSE CONTACTS.  WHICH IS DEFINED ABOUT SIX FEET.  THROUGH RESPIRATORY DROPLETS PRODUCED WHEN AN INFECTED PERSON COUGHS OR SNEEZES.  PEOPLE ARE THOUGHT TO BE THE MOST CONTAGEOUS WHEN THEY’RE MOST SYSTEMATIC.  THAT’S WHEN THEY’RE THE SICKEST.  SOME SPREAD MAY HAPPEN BY TOUCHING THE CONTAMINATED SURFACE AND TOUCHING THE EYES, NOSE AND MOUTH.  BUT REMEMBER THIS DOES NOT LAST LONG ON SURFACES. SOME SPREAD MAY HAPPEN BEFORE PEOPLE SHOW SYMPTOMS. THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW REPORTS OF THIS WITH THE NEW CORONAVIRUS AND IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES INCLUDING SEASONAL FLU.  BUT RIGHT NOW, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE LAST TWO FORMS OF TRANSMISSION ARE THE MAIN DRIVER OF SPREAD.  WE AT CDC RECOGNIZE THIS IS A DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE RETURNED FROM WUHAN AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTING THEM.  AND ASK FOR THEIR CONTINUED PATIENCE AS WE WORK TOGETHER.  THIS IS A DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TIME ON MANY FRONTS.  THE FOOTAGE OUT OF CHINA IS UPSETTING.  OTHERS ARE BEING QUARANTINED IN OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING ON THE DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP.  ON THE RESPONDERS’ SIDE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK AROUND THE WORLD TO TRY TO CONTAIN THE DAMAGE.  I LOOK AROUND AND I SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE TIRED BUT WHO ARE DETERMINED AND GOVERNED BY A SENSE OF URGENCY THAT THE HEALTH OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS DEPENDENT AT LEAST IN PART ON THEIR WORK.  THIS NEW VIRUS REPRESENTS THE UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT AND WE ARE TAKING AGGRESSIVE ACTION TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE, OUR FAMILIES AND OUR NATION SAFE.  WE APPRECIATE EVERYONE’S CONTINUED COOPERATION THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS.  CDC’S CURRENT ACTIONS INCLUDING QUARANTINES AND THE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ARE INTENDED TO SLOW THE INTRODUCTION AND IMPACT OF THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS IN THE U.S.  HOWEVER, WE MUST PREPARE FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT AT SOME  POINT WE MAY SEE SUSTAINED COMMUNITY SPREAD IN OTHER COUNTRIES OR IN THE U.S. AND THIS WILL TRIGGER A CHANGE IN OUR RESPONSE STRATEGY.  THIS WILL REQUIRE THE EFFORTS OF ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT, THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM AND OUR COMMUNITIES AS WE FACE THIS CHALLENGE TOGETHER.  LAST NIGHT, THE VICE MINISTER OF CHINA’S NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION ANNOUNCED THERE ARE MORE THAN 1,700 HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO ARE ILL WITH THIS NEW VIRUS IN CHINA.  MAINLY IN HUBEI PROVINCE. THIS IS CONCERNING AND WE SAW THAT TRANSMISSION CAN BE AMPLIFIED IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS IF INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES ARE NOT CAREFULLY FOLLOWED.  HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE ON THE FRONT LINE, SUPPORTING THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF THOSE WHO ARE INFECTED.  AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THIS VIRUS IS SPREAD, KEEPING HEALTH CARE WORKERS SAFE IS A HIGH PRIORITY.  CDC HAS PUBLISHED GUIDANCE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS ON HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AS THEY CARE FOR PATIENTS AND I’M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT SO FAR NO HEALTH CARE WORKERS IN THE U.S. HAVE BECOME INFECTED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.  BEFORE TAKING QUESTIONS, I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON TWO MORE THINGS.  FIRST, YESTERDAY, SECRETARY AZAR MENTIONED THAT THE CDC HAS BEGUN WORKING WITH FIVE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS TO CONDUCT COMMUNITY BASED INFLUENZA BASED SURVEILLANCE SO WE CAN TEST THOSE WITH FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS FOR NOVEL CORONAVIRUS.  THOSE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS ARE IN LOS ANGELES, SAN FRANCISCO, SEATTLE, CHICAGO AND NEW YORK CITY AND I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION, COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT.  THIS IS JUST THE STARTING POINT AND WE PLAN TO EXPAND TO MORE SITES IN THE COMING WEEKS UNTIL WE HAVE NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE.  THIS IS LEVERAGING OUR EXISTING INFLUENZA AND VIRAL RESPIRATORY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS.  THIS IS AN EXTRA LAYER OF OUR RESPONSE THAT WILL HELP US DETECT IF AND WHEN THIS VIRUS IS SPEADING IN THE COMMUNITY.  ALL OF OUR EFFORTS NOW ARE TO PREVENT THE SUSTAINED SPREAD OF THE VIRUS IS IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WILL SPREAD.  RESULTS FROM THIS SURVEILLANCE WOULD BE AN EARLY WARNING SIGNAL TO TRIGGER A CHANGE IN OUR RESPONSE STRATEGY.  SECOND, AS WE TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL THREAT OF THIS NEW VIRUS, I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE OF THE VERY REAL THREAT OF SEASONAL INFLUENZA.  REPORTS OF INFLUENZA LIKE ILLNESS AND TESTING FOR INFLUENZA HAVE INCREASED IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS.  WHILE INFLUENZA “B” WAS PREDOMINANT IN DECEMBER, WE HAVE SEEN A SHARP RISE IN INFLUENZA “A” H1N1 RECENTLY.  HOSPITAL RATES IN CHILDREN ARE HIGH, ABOUT AS HIGH AS WE SAW DURING THE 2017-18 SEASON WHICH WAS A SEVERE SEASON.  SO FAR THIS SEASON, WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST 26 MILLION FLU ILLNESSES, 250,000 HOSPITALIZATIONS, AND 14,000 DEATHS FROM FLU, SOME OF THOSE AMONG CHILDREN.  WE HAVE THE VACCINES AND THE DRUGS TO FIGHT FLU ILLNESS.  WE DON’T HAVE THE TOOLS YET FOR THIS NOVEL VIRUS BUT THERE ARE THINGS EVERYONE CAN DO TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS.  STAY INFORMED.  CDC’S UPDATING THE WEBSITE DAILY WITH THE LATEST INFORMATION AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC.  AND REMEMBER TO TAKE EVERYDAY PREVENTIVE ACTIONS TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF RESPIRATORY VIRUS.  WE RECOGNIZE THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE CURRENT SITUATION AS ALWAYS CDC PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS STRIVE TO MAKE THE BEST RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE MOST UP TO DATE DATA.  OUR GUIDANCE WILL CHANGE AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS VIRUS. I’D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS.
>> THANK YOU.  IF YOU’D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION, YOU MAY PRESS STAR ONE.  PLEASE LIMIT TO ONE QUESTION AND ONE FOLLOW-UP.  THANK YOU.  LENA SUN FROM “WASHINGTON POST,”  YOU MAY GO AHEAD.
>> HI, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS.  FIRST, COULD YOU PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW THIS SURVEILLANCE IS GOING TO WORK IN THOSE FIVE LOCALITIES?  AND THEN SECOND, I WONDERED WHETHER YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE GOTTEN OR WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS.  DO WE KNOW WHETHER THEY WERE INFECTED RECENTLY?  IS IT, YOU KNOW, JUST SORT OF A LATE DATA COMING THROUGH FROM EARLIER ON?  ANY MORE LIGHT YOU COULD SHED ON THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.  THANK YOU.
>> SURE.  THANK YOU.  SO IN RESPONSE TO THE FIRST QUESTION, WHAT I WOULD GENERALLY SAY IS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT EXISTING SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS FOR BOTH INFLUENZA AND FOR VIRAL RESPIRATORY DISEASES AND MODIFYING THEM TO BE ABLE TO DETECT THIS NEW CORONAVIRUS BECAUSE THAT’S A REALLY EFFICIENT WAY FOR US TO STAND UP WITHOUT BUILDING INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS.  IF YOU GO TO THE FLU VIEW, YOU WILL SEE ALL OF THE SYSTEMS THAT WE’RE USING AND THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL BASICALLY WHAT WE’RE DOING AT THOSE SITES.  EVERY ONE OF THOSE SITES IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SO IT’S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME OPERATIONS IN EACH OF THE SITES, BUT BASICALLY WE’RE TAKING THOSE FIVE SITES’ FLU SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS AND ADDING ON LABORATORY TESTING AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS FOR NOVEL CORONAVIRUS.  ABOUT THE SECOND ISSUE, ALL WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR IS THE REPORTS THAT CAME OUT OVERNIGHT.  IT’S OBVIOUSLY A CONCERNING NUMBER SO I WANTED TO MENTION IT.  WE DON’T HAVE MORE DETAILS YET AS TO WHEN THOSE CASES OCCURRED.  THAT IS, YOU KNOW, WHEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE OUTBREAK THE CASES OCCURRED AND WE’LL BE HOPING FOR MORE INFORMATION AND OBVIOUSLY THE TEAMS IN THE FIELD HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT AS THEY GET — AS W.H.O. TEAMS GET THEIR MISSIONS MOVING.  NEXT QUESTION.
>> ADRIAN JOSEPH, YOU MAY GO AHEAD.
>> THANKS.  SO THE W.H.O. SAID IN THEIR PRESS BRIEFING THIS MORNING THAT I THINK A 12 MEMBER TEAM HAS — IS GOING INTO CHINA INTO THREE PROVINCES, THEY DIDN’T SPECIFY WHICH AND I GUESS I’M WONDERING IF THE CDC OR ANY AMERICAN MEMBERS ARE PART OF THE TEAM OR THERE STILL NEGOTIATING POSITIONS ABOUT GETTING THE U.S.  TEAMS IN?
>> I HADN’T SEEN THAT NOTICE YET, BUT I’M HAPPY THAT WAS ANNOUNCED.  I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE’S A LARGER TEAM GOING IN.  WE’RE QUITE HAPPY THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OUTSIDE EXPERIMENTS.  WE HOPE THAT THE CDC STAFF WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE MISSION BUT I DON’T HAVE THE DETAILS AT HAND AS TO EXACTLY THOSE 12 MEMBERS ARE.  AGAIN WHEN WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION WE’LL DEFINITELY PROVIDE IT.  NEXT QUESTION.
>> MIKE STOBBE FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, YOU MAY GO AHEAD.
>> HI, THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY CALL.  FIRST, FOLLOWING LENA SUN’S QUESTION — I’LL GO TO YOUR WEBSITE BUT ARE THESE PUBLIC STATE — STATE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS OR CITY LABS OR — JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE FACILITIES AND WHAT TESTING SYSTEM HAS ALREADY BEEN PART OF.  ALSO, COULD YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THE TEST KITS THAT WENT OUT TO THE STATES?  HOW IS THAT GOING?  HAVE THEY WORKED OUT THE REAGENT PROBLEM THAT THEY REMANUFACTURED IT OR WHEN ARE NEW KITS GOING OUT?  THANK YOU.
>> SO THE FIRST QUESTION IN TERMS OF WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH LABS ARE TALKING ABOUT, THESE ARE THE SAME PUBLIC HEALTH LABS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE NETWORK OF PUBLIC HEALTH LABS THAT IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF A LOT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE IN THE UNITED STATES.  SO AMONG THE SITES THAT I MENTIONED ONE OF THOSE AS A CITY — THE OTHER IS A PUBLIC HEALTH LAB AND THEY’RE PART OF THE NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE NETWORK THAT WE DO FOR INFLUENZA WHICH IS WHY I DIRECT YOU TO FLU VIEW.  THEY’RE CURRENTLY TESTING FOR INFLUENZA AND THE IDEA IS THEY’LL TEST THE INFLUENZA NEGATIVE SPECIMENS FOR NOVEL CORONAVIRUS.  SORRY, FOR SARS COVID 2.  SO IT’S BASICALLY TAKING THE ALREADY EXISTING INFLUENZA PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY SURVEILLANCE AND LOOKING AT THOSE THAT ARE FLU NEGATIVE FOR THIS NEW VIRUS.  AGAIN, IT’S AN EFFICIENT WAY TO STAND UP SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY.  IN TERMS OF THE LAB KITS AS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT WE CAN BE PROUD OF HOW RAPIDLY OUR LABORATORY — WE CAN DEVELOP THE LAB DIAGNOSTIC IT IS BEING USED AT CDC UNDER HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS AS WE MOVED QUICKLY TO GET THAT OUT TO THE STATE AND THE STATES DID THEIR OWN VERIFICATION, THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS WITH ONE OF THE REAGENTS AT THE STATE — THAT THE STATES IDENTIFIED.  THEY WERE GETTING INDETERMINANT ANSWERS WHICH IS A SIGN THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE SOMETHING DONE DIFFERENTLY.  SO WHAT WE’RE DOING AT CDC IS REFORMULATING THOSE REAGENTS AND WE ARE MOVING QUICKLY TO GET THOSE BACK OUT TO OUR LABS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH LABS.  BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HOLD OURSELVES TO THE HIGH QUALITY STANDARD AS WE SHOULD AND AS OUR STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS DO AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY DOT IS DOTTED AND EVERY “T” IS CROSSED BEFORE WE PUT THE KITS OUT.  AS SOON AS I HAVE AN ACTUAL TIME LINE I’LL GIVE IT TO YOU BUT I HATE TO PROJECT BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS DONE AT THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL THAT CDC AND FTA AND ALL OF YOU EXPECT OF US.  NEXT QUESTION.
>> — FROM THE SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST, JIMMY, GO AHEAD.
>> HI, I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK TO WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE — MOVING ON FROM KIND OF — [ INDISCERNIBLE ].  IS THIS LIKE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN BROACHED — THIS SUBJECT.  WHAT WOULD MITIGATION LOOK LIKE IN THE U.S. AND THE HEALTH CARE CONDITIONS ARE IN PLACE IF YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT KIND OF CHANGE IN YOUR RESPONSE STRATEGY?
>> THANK YOU.  I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU’RE ASKING ABOUT IS THE CHANGE BETWEEN CONTAINMENT AND MITIGATION AND WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME TO SAY THAT IT’S NOT BLACK AND WHITE.  THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THOSE COMPONENTS MERGED TOGETHER ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, POTENTIALLY AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS.  WE’RE CONTINUING TO HOPE THAT WE WON’T SEE COMMUNITIES SPREAD AND CERTAINLY HOPING THAT OUR MEASURES GIVE US EXTRA TIME TO PREPARE BY GAINING OURSELVES THIS TIME, THE HOPE IS THAT WE’LL HAVE MORE TIME TO PREPARE.  BUT FRANKLY OUR MODEL SUGGESTS THAT WE MAY BLUNT THE HEIGHT OF ANY CURVE AND THAT WOULD BE THE VALUED OUTCOME.  WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE, MITIGATION, IS WHEN YOU STOP TRYING TO TRACE CLOSE CONTACTS AROUND EVERY CASE TO CONTAIN THE CASE, AND INSTEAD TO FOCUS ON — FOCUS ON THE DISRUPTION AND THE COMMUNITY TRYING TO DECREASE THE BURDEN, TRYING TO DECREASE THE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY.  DOING EVERYTHING TO HELP AT A SOCIETAL LEVEL.  THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT ARE COMMUNITY LED LEVEL DECISIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN GENERAL, SOCIAL DISTANCING, SCHOOL CLOSURES, CANCELING MASS GATHERINGS, SORT OF NONPHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE TELEMEDICINE, TELESCHOOLING, TELEWORKING SO THAT AT A SOCIETAL LEVEL WE TRY TO DISRUPT THE SPREAD.  IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE WE DON’T HAVE A VACCINE AND WE DON’T YET HAVE A SPECIFIC COUNTERMEASURE, THOSE KIND OF NONPHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS AT A COMMUNITY LEVEL ARE REALLY IMPORTANT.  THAT’S WHY IN THIS TIME THAT WE HAVE GAINED OURSELF IS WORKING CLOSELY ACROSS ALL OF GOVERNMENT AND WITH OUR LOCAL AND STATE PARTNERS ON PLANNING FOR THOSE OPERATIONS.  FORTUNATELY IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF PLANNING AROUND PANDEMIC INFLUENZA WE HAVE A GOOD HEAD START, BUT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE PLANS, SEE HOW THE CURRENT SITUATION MIGHT ALTER THEM AND YOU’LL SEE A LOT OF THE GUIDANCE COMING UP ON THE WEBSITE IN THE COMING WEEKS.  NEXT QUESTION.
>> JULIE STEENHUYSEN FROM REUTERS, YOU MAY GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU.  I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS THAT WERE INFECTED IN CHINA.  CAN YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS VIRUS VERSUS OTHER CORONAVIRUSES SUCH AS SARS THAT WOULD BE PLAYING A ROLE IN THESE INFECTIONS?  I MEAN, IS THERE ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT BETWEEN THOSE — I MEAN, HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS WERE HUGE WITH SARS BUT THEY WERE ALSO ABLE TO BE CONTROLLED WITH SARS.  I’M JUST WONDERING WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS VIRUS AND IS IT DIFFERENT THAT COULD EXPLAIN ALL THOSE INFECTIONS?  ALSO, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO BLUNT THE HEIGHT OF ANY CURVE.  I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU MEAN ABOUT THAT?  CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT WHAT YOUR MODELS ARE PREDICTING?  THANK YOU.
>> SURE.  IT’S DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, SO START WITH THE FIRST ONE.  SO AS YOU SORT OF IMPLY WITH SARS AND MERS, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS AND IT FUELED THE HIGH LEVEL OF CASES IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS.  THERE’S NOTHING SPECIFIC THAT HELPS US DIFFERENTIATE IF IT’S MORE OR LESS LIKELY.  I GUESS THOSE NUMBERS THAT CAME OUT OVERNIGHT CONCERN ME SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO TALK ABOUT IT ON THIS CALL.  TO POINT OUT THAT WE NEED TO BE PRISTINE IN OUR HEALTH CARE SETTING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE SAFE.  THAT BREAKDOWN IN INFECTION CONTROL IN THE HEALTH CARE SETTING IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT INFECTION CONTROL PRACTITIONERS WORK AT EVERY SINGLE DAY BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS DO EXIST AND THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS DO HAVE TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF PRECISION EVERY DAY TO PREVENT NOSOCOMIAL SPREAD.  IT’S A REMINDER WITH THE NEW VIRUS THERE’S A LOT WE DON’T KNOW SO WE NEED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION.  IN TERMS OF MODELING, I HAVE BEEN ASKED THIS BEFORE BUT AT CDC WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM PREVIOUS OUTBREAKS OF THE VARIETY OF DISEASES.  ESPECIALLY WITH INFLUENZA.  THERE AREN’T — THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE 50 DIFFERENT GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE DOING MATHEMATICAL MODELING AROUND THIS OUTBREAK.  AND WHAT WE’RE DOING IS LOOKING ACROSS ALL OF THOSE GROUPS AND LOOKING AT ALL OF THE MODELS TO TRY TO GET THE BEST DATA THAT WE CAN TO HELP US INFORM THE U.S.  RESPONSE.  THEY’RE LOOKING AT A WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS AND STARTING WERE THE SAME ASSUMPTIONS WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE THINGS WITH THE DIFFERENT MODELS TOGETHER.  ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OUR INFLUENZA MODELERS HAVE LOOKED AT IS THE IDEA THAT IF YOU COULD PUT IN PLACE SOME OF THESE COMMUNITY MITIGATION EFFORTS, YOU CAN DELAY THE ON SET OF THE PEAK OF THE CURVE BUT ALSO BLUNT THE CURVE.  SO I GUESS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN AND THERE’S A PICTURE SITTING IN FRONT OF ME, I WISH I COULD POINT IT OUT, BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE ON THE WEBSITE.  BUT IT’S A TYPICAL PICTURE THAT WE USE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE KIND OF INTERVENTIONS WITH PANDEMIC INFLUENZA.  YOU KNOW, THE IDEA IS THAT THIS VIRUS IS BEHAVING IN MANY WAYS LIKE WE’D EXPECT INFLUENZA IN TERMS OF ITS SPREAD.  THEREFORE, WE THINK THE SAME MITIGATION EFFORTS MIGHT HAVE THE SAME KIND OF IMPACT AND THAT’S WHAT WE’RE USING THE MATHEMATICAL MODELING TO LOOK AT.  NEXT QUESTION.
>> FROM “THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,” YOU MAY GO AHEAD.
>> HI, THANKS.  I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THE DIAMOND PRINCESS.  JUST WONDERING IF AMERICANS WHO DISEMBARK FROM THE CRUISE SHIP WILL THEY UNDERGO ADDITIONAL SCREENINGS BY CDC OR QUARANTINE WHEN THEY RETURN TO THE U.S.?  JUST WHAT’S THE PLAN FOR THEM?
>> WELL, THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION.  WHAT I CAN SAY IS WHILE I’M ON THE PHONE WITH YOU, OTHER SENIOR CDC STAFF ARE WORKING ACROSS THE GOVERNMENT, INTERAGENCY, WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS WITH THE FOLKS IN JAPAN, THE EMBASSY IN JAPAN, TO FIGURE OUT A PLAN.  THESE — IT’S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE SAFE AND TAKEN WELL CARE OF.  WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE DATA COMING OUT OF JAPAN SUGGESTS THERE’S A HIGHER RISK AMONG THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIP AND THEREFORE THEIR SAFETY IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE.  AND THAT SAFETY MEANS PRECAUTIONS FOR THEM TO DO THE BEST WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY’RE SAFE AND WELL TREATED IF THEY ARE INDEED SICK.  BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID SPREAD OF THE VIRUS TO ANYONE ELSE.  I DON’T HAVE A SPECIFIC ANSWER RIGHT NOW YET.  I’M SORRY BECAUSE THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE ONGOING BUT THERE WHEN THERE’S A SPECIFIC PLAN WE’LL BE LETTING YOU KNOW.  NEXT QUESTION.
>> EMMA COURT FROM BLOOMBERG NEWS, YOU MAY GO AHEAD.
>> HI, I WAS HOPING YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME MORE CLARITY ABOUT THE MISSION — THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION MISSION AND WHETHER U.S. OFFICIALS WILL BE PART OF IT ALSO.  HOPING YOU CAN FIND DISTRESSING — YOU CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU FIND DISTRESSING ABOUT THE WUHAN FOOTAGE.
>> YES.  AS I SAY, WE — I HAD NOT SEEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT THIS MORNING FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.  I DID UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS SOME THE ADVANCE — THE ADVANCED TEAM WAS PLANNING FOR A FURTHER MISSION WITH MORE STAFF SO I’M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THAT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED.  THE COMPOSITION OF THE TEAM IN TERMS OF WHO THE ACTUAL MEMBERS ARE ON THIS FIRST TEAM HASN’T BEEN ANNOUNCED YET SO I CAN’T SPEAK TO THAT.  BUT WE CONTINUE TO HOPE THAT CDC STAFF WILL BE — WILL BE INCLUDED IN THAT MISSION.  OBVIOUSLY, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE GREAT EXPERTISE HERE AT CDC AND I HOPE WE CAN USE IT TO SUPPORT OUR CHINESE COLLEAGUES.  IN TERMS OF WUHAN, WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE PICTURES CERTAINLY SHOW CASE THAT THE CITIZENS OF WUHAN ARE SUFFERING, BOTH FROM THE DISEASE, BUT ALSO FROM THE FEAR THAT IS CLEARLY PRESENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL FEEL FOR THAT SUFFERING AND, YOU KNOW, OUR WORK HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IS TO CONTAIN THE VIRUS.  WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CASES HERE, WE EXPECT THAT THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL CASES.  BUT WHAT WE’RE FOCUSING ON RIGHT NOW IS CONTAINING THE VIRUS WITH ONLY 15 CASES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE REMAIN OPTIMISTIC THAT OUR AGGRESSIVE MEASURES HAVE SLOWED THE IMPACT OF IT HERE.  AND WE’RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE AGGRESSIVELY IN THAT WAY.  PREPARING FOR THE SPREAD BUT HOPING THAT WITH THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN WE’LL BE ABLE TO PREVENT IT.  I THINK NOW MAYBE WE HAVE TIME FOR TWO MORE QUESTIONS.
>> THANK YOU.  DAN VERGANO — FROM BUZZFEED NEWS, YOU MAY GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEROLOGICAL TESTING AND WHAT’S THE HOLDUP IN WHAT THAT WOULD REQUEST US UP AND CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU’RE DOING TO BLUNT THE OUTBREAKS OF THE MEASURES?
>> SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION, YES, WE’LL POST IT ON THE WEBSITE TO MAKE IT CLEARER.  TRYING TO DESCRIBE THE GRAPH AND — WORDS IT WILL BE BEYOND ME A LITTLE BIT.  YES, WE’LL DEFINITELY POST THAT.  IN TERMS OF THE SEROLOGY I’LL START BY SAYING THAT I AGREE A SEROLOGICAL TEST IS IMPORTANT.  WE CAN IDENTIFY WHETHER PEOPLE ARE BEING EXPOSED ENOUGH TO MOUNT AN IMMUNE RESPONSE WITHOUT GETTING ILL.  SO IT WOULD HELP US WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS IS.  AND WHETHER THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH NO OR MILD SYMPTOMS ARE GETTING EXPOSE AND ZERO CONVERTING THAT’S SOMETHING WE WANT TO KNOW FOR THE UNITED STATES AND SOMETHING TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND THE OUTBREAK OF THE — IN CHINA.  OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM THE LABORATORY COLLEAGUES IT JUST TAKES A WHILE.  WE NEED TO WAIT TO DRAW SPECIMENS FROM U.S. PATIENTS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE — WHAT THE SEROLOGY RESULTS LOOK LIKE IN PATIENTS OVER TIME TO BE ABLE TO SET THE RIGHT METRICS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO USE IT IN PATIENTS WHO AREN’T YET DIAGNOSED.  SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS KIND OF DELAY IS WHAT YOU’D EXPECT TO SEE AND THEY’RE MOVING VERY QUICKLY AND DEFINITELY A PRIORITY FOR US.  WHEN WE HAVE A TIME LINE, WHICH WILL LET YOU KNOW.  ONCE THEY HAVE ALL OF THE APPROPRIATE SPECIMENS COLLECTED, I UNDERSTAND THAT IT’S A MATTER OF SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THAT BECAUSE THEY’LL ACTUALLY HAVE THE TEST.  BUT WE DON’T HAVE ALL OF THE SPECIMENS YET.  I THINK THIS IS THE LAST QUESTION.
>> LAST QUESTION.
>> THANK YOU.  DAVID BLOOM FROM POLITICO, YOU MAY GO AHEAD.
>> ALL RIGHT.  THANK YOU.  I’D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT — IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE — [ INDISCERNIBLE ].  AND CHECKING OUT THE THREAT IN THE UNITED STATES.  ARE YOU LOOKING TO THE RISK — [ INDISCERNIBLE ].
>> I’M SORRY.  THAT WAS A LITTLE GARBLED BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND IT.  I THINK WHAT YOU’RE ASKING ABOUT IS FUNDING AND AS WE’RE MOVING FORWARD, SETTING UP ADDITIONAL SURVEILLANCE THE QUESTION OF THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO DO THAT.  SO I WILL START BY SAYING AGAIN THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL TO CONGRESS FOR THEIR INVESTMENTS OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS IN PANDEMIC INFLUENZA PREPAREDNESS, IT’S BECAUSE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE BUILD THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS THAT WE’RE NOW LEANING ON AS WELL AS THE SYSTEMS TO HELP US FOR EXAMPLE FIGURE OUT MITIGATION EFFORTS.  SO THAT’S A LONG TERM INVESTMENT AT CDC AND OUR STATES WHICH WE THINK IS SHOWING ITSELF NOW.  IN ADDITION, WE’RE GRATEFUL FOR THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE, RAPID RESPONSE FUND.  THAT REALLY HAS BEEN A GAME CHANGER FOR US IN ENABLING CDC TO QUICKLY STAND UP OPERATIONS AND WE’RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT USE.  THE ADDITIONAL — WE SAID THAT WHEN WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS WE’LL ASK FOR IT.  RIGHT NOW, FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN A CONSTRAINT FOR US IN STANDING UP THE ACTIVITIES THAT WE’RE DOING NOW.  AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD, I’M SURE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION OF WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE.  BUT THE REASON WE’RE DOING THE SURVEILLANCE THE WAY WE ARE BECAUSE IT’S THE EFFECTIVE WAY TO MOVE FORWARD BUT WE THINK IT’S EFFICIENT BECAUSE THOSE ARE EXISTING SYSTEMS AT CDC AND OUR STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS ARE ALREADY USING SO THAT’S WHY WE’RE LEANING ON THE SYSTEMS.  THANK YOU.

Your lines have been placed in a listen only mode until the question and answer section. At that time if you would like to ask a question, you may press star 1. Today’s conference is being recorded.  If you have any objections, you can disconnect at this time. I’ll now turn the call over to Benjamin Haynes; you may begin sir.
Ben Haynes: Good morning, thank you for joining us for today’s update on the 2019 Novel Coronavirus response.  We are joined today by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Dr. Marty Cetron, director of CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine; and health officials from the Illinois Department of Health.  Following opening remarks, we will open it up for your questions.  I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Messonnier.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Good morning, thank you for joining us.  Over the last week, I’ve said that with our advanced surveillance and detection capacity, we expect find more cases of novel coronavirus in the United States associated with the ongoing and expanding outbreak in Wuhan, China.  We understand that some people are worried about this virus and how it may impact Americans.  While this situation poses a very serious public health threat, CDC believes that the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low at this time, but the situation continues to evolve rapidly.  Today I am joined by representatives from Illinois and Chicago to announce that we have confirmed a second travel-related U.S. infection of novel coronavirus.  I would like to hand the briefing over to my colleague Illinois Department of Public Health State Epidemiologist Dr. Jennifer Layden, who will discuss about the specifics about this patient and the specific actions taken by IDPH.  Dr. Layden.
Dr. Jennifer Layden: Thank you Dr. Messonnier, and good morning. I am Dr. Jennifer Layden, the State Epidemiologist and Chief Medical Officer for the Illinois Department of Public Health.  I would like to start by thanking our local public health partners in Illinois, healthcare partners and the CDC for the coordinated and collaborative work on this rapidly evolving situation.  It is because of the diligent work by numerous health professionals that we were able to identify this confirmed travel-associated case of novel coronavirus quickly while also taking measures to prevent others from being exposed.  IDPH has been closely monitoring this international outbreak and began proactively preparing in the event the outbreak expanded.  We have been providing the CDC guidance, resources, and recommendations to our local health departments, hospitals, and clinicians; developed a dedicated website and webpage; and held webinars this week for local health departments, clinicians, and healthcare facilities across the state.  Earlier this week we were notified by our local health department partners of a Chicago resident who had returned from Wuhan on January 13.  The individual did not have symptoms while travelling.  More recently, the individual began experiencing symptoms, called healthcare providers and ultimately was admitted to the hospital and placed in isolation.  As the patient did in this case, we ask that any individuals who begin experiencing symptoms and have recently traveled to Wuhan or had contact with someone diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, call their healthcare provider or hospital before seeking treatments so that the appropriate infection control measures can be put in place.  Coordination between the hospitals, local and state health departments allowed specimens to be quickly shipped and tested at the CDC.  This coordination between providers, hospitals, and public health is critical for our continued effort to best respond to and reduce transmission.  The Illinois Department of Public Health will continue to partner with the CDC and has invited them to Illinois to assist with this investigation.  IDPH is ready to bring testing online at our state labs when testing is available from the CDC.  We will continue to communicate and coordinate with our local health departments and numerous clinical partners as we respond to this evolving situation.  I would now like to turn it over to Dr. Allison Arwady, the Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner, who can provide more information about this patient and the next steps of the investigation.
Dr. Allison Arwady: Thank you, Dr. Layden.  This is Dr. Allison Arwady, the Commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.  The patient is a woman in her 60s and a Chicago resident.  Most importantly, I am pleased to report she’s clinically doing well and is in stable condition.  She traveled to Wuhan, China in late December and returned to the U.S. on January 13.  A few days after arriving home, the patient began to feel unwell.  As you heard, she called ahead to alert her doctor to her illness.  The doctor appropriately asked about travel history and quickly put a mask on the patient helping to limit the potential risk of spreading infection.  Her doctor then referred her directly to a hospital with infection control capabilities for further work up.  Hospital staff placed her in the appropriate vetting for infection control, performed a full clinical work up, and worked with public health to arrange testing for novel coronavirus at CDC.  The patient is clinically doing well, currently in stable condition and remains hospitalized primarily for infection control.  The patient has been very helpful as we have been gathering information about her contacts in recent days.  Again, she was not symptomatic when flying, and based on what we know now about this virus, our concern for transmission before symptoms developed is low.  So that is reassuring.  She has limited close contacts, all of whom are currently well, and will be monitored for symptoms.  Since returning from China, the patient has had limited movement outside her home.  Now that the test is positive, we will be continuing to collect and confirm information on her activities and contacts.  But we know already for example that she had not taken public transportation or attended any large gathering.  And actually, to our best knowledge at this point, she has not had extended close contact with anyone outside her home since returning from China.  This is all very reassuring in terms of infection risk to the general public which remains low nationally and locally here in Chicago.  I want to thank the federal state and many local partners who have worked together not just in response to this case but over many years to ensure the Chicago area is well prepared to respond to emerging and infectious diseases.
Dr. Messonnier: Thank you both. This is Dr. Messonnier and I want to take a moment to thank our colleagues in Illinois at the state and local level who have been working with us since earlier this week when the patient was identified.  Like we did with the state of Washington, a CDC team has been deployed to support the ongoing investigation in Illinois, and as always, we standby to help state, local, and global partners.  I also would like to thank all the states and clinicians who have reached out to us over the last few days to discuss potential cases, and who have followed up by sending samples if it was warranted.  This is a sign that the public health system is working.  To date, we have 63 of what we are calling patients under investigation or PUIs from 22 states.  So far, only two have been confirmed positive and 11 tested negative.  We anticipate by next week we’ll begin regular reporting of case information on our website.  There are likely to be many more PUIs identified in the coming days.  We have faced similar public health challenges before.  Those outbreaks were complex and required a comprehensive public health response.  This is what we are preparing for.  We have an aggressive response with the goal of identifying potential cases early. We want to make sure these patients get the best and most appropriate care.  This is a rapidly changing situation both abroad and domestically, and we are still learning.  Let’s remember this virus is identified within the past month and there is much we don’t know yet.  We are expecting more cases in the U.S., and we are likely going to see some cases among close contacts of travelers and human to human transmission.  Our goal is always to protect the health of Americans.  We at CDC have our best people working on this problem.  We have support across the entirety of the Federal Government.  We have one of the strongest public health systems in the world.  Again, while there are many unknowns, CDC believes that the immediate risk to the American public continues to be low at this time, but that the situation continues to evolve rapidly.  CDC recommends travelers avoid all non-essential travel to Wuhan.  We also recommend people traveling to other parts of China practice certain health precautions, like avoiding contact with people who are sick and practicing good hand hygiene.  Returning travelers with symptoms, or close contact with people confirmed with coronavirus, may be asked to take precautionary measures and there may be some disruptions.  I want to thank those people in advance for their cooperation.  Everyone can do their part here.  Although Chinese officials have closed transport within and out of Wuhan, China, CDC will continue to conduct enhanced screening at five designated airports: New York JFK, San Francisco, LAX, Chicago O’Hare and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson. We are currently evaluating the extent and duration of this enhanced screening.  Every day we learn more and every day we assess to see if our guidance or response can be improved.  As the response evolves, CDC will continue our aggressive public health response strategy.  Thank you.
Ben Haynes: Thank you, Dr. Messonnier.  We are ready to take questions.
Operator:  Thank you, we will now begin our question/answer segment.  You may press star 1 to ask a question and one moment please for our first question.
Our first question comes from Lena Sun with the Washington Post.
Lena Sun: Thank you doctors for holding this call and thank you so much for starting it on time for those of us who are on the other call yesterday.  I have a question; can you tell us how many people have been screened and is it possible to get a list of the 22 states and how many people — how many close contacts are being monitored?
Dr. Marty Cetron: Yes, we have screened over 2,000 folks to date as of yesterday, and that’s about 200 flights.  We have not found any cases; one person was sent for additional medical evaluation.  That’s the current status of screening at the five ports for the active entry screening.
Dr. Messonnier: In terms of the number of states, I don’t have that information today.  It is one of those things we are hoping to be able to post on the web next week.
OK, I am sorry, I am — Nina, there are 22 states.  The specific information about which state is again something we hope to post by next week.  I am sorry, I missed the third question?  Oh, the contact list.
I think that would be premature for us to give you absolute numbers, but I ask my colleagues in Chicago, Illinois, if you want to give a sense of how many people you are tracking.
Dr. Allison Arwady:  This is Allison Arwady in Chicago.  We are currently working to determine exactly what our list is going to be for monitoring, this patient had limited close contacts and the ones that have been identified are currently well will certainly be working with the CDC team on the ground to make sure there is a full list of those folks as well as healthcare workers caring for the patients.  We are not ready to share details at this time. We are well on our way to having all of that established.
Dr. Messonnier:  This is Dr. Messonnier again, I would just like to say that given the unknowns as we continue to learn about the virus, the public health community is airing on the side of caution in terms of following close contacts as you would expect at this point in the investigation.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Next question comes from Helen Branswell with STAT.
Helen Branswell: Is there any indication of illness among the contacts of the patient with illness in Washington state.  That’s the first.  The second in your discussion with the woman who was in Wuhan, the new case, is there any indication of how she may have become infected?  Did she go to the fish market or was she around people who were sick? And the third question is for Dr. Cetron, given that flights out of Wuhan have been stopped, what are you actually doing at the five airports now and was the number of the cities that you are trying to monitor from expanded?
Dr. Messonnier: The first answer, to whether or not there is illness among contacts of Washington state, is at this time we have not identified any illness among the contacts of the initial patient in Washington state.  Dr. Layden or Dr. Arwady, do you want to answer the second question about what you know about how she potentially became infected.
Dr. Allison Arwady:  We are not at this time releasing any other personal information about the patient. Certainly, with the CDC team on the ground, we’ll be gathering additional information about her activities and travel in China just like what we are doing here on the Chicago side.  Decisions to screen and test these patients, as folks know, are purely based being in Wuhan as opposed to specific activities.  That’s what we can share at this point.
Dr. Marty Cetron: And Helen this is Dr. Marty Cetron, and I think your point is well taken. We have seen a fairly dramatic change in the situation in China with the government’s announcement of travel bans and restrictions out of Wuhan and actually those are extending to additional cities as we speak.  As you would expect, we are reevaluating the approach, and as I said earlier when we first began entry screening with a clear focus on the epidemic epicenter that we would continue to evaluate the balance and utility of a border entry screening program based on the totality of the circumstances.  Those circumstances have clearly changed.  We are reevaluating that approach and watching for both expansion to other cities as well as concentrating the efforts.  As you heard today, it is really important to point out that both of the initial first two U.S. cases were asymptomatic and afebrile when they arrived.  The concentration of resources and efforts need to be focused on the tremendous work that our state and local partners are doing to rapidly identify cases and contacts and assure that the American health is protected.  So, there will be a balance and a shifting in how we look at entry screening as we go into the new scenario with the travel closures.
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Elvia Malagon, with the Chicago Tribune.
Elvia Malagon: Is there any indication that the patient had traveled with anyone, when she went to China, and have any of those people been tested for this?
Dr. Allison Arwady:  There were no other Chicago or Illinois residents that traveled with this patient.  Therefore, we are not testing anybody in that setting.  We are though following on with her close contacts in any of these situations.
Operator: This question comes from Issam Ahmed AFP.  You may ask question.  Your line is open.
Issam Ahmed: Out of the 63 cases on the investigation you mentioned, 11 tested negative. So just to get a breakdown, those 11 are out of the 63 and the two confirmed positives are out of the 63 total?
Dr. Messonnier: Yes, that’s correct, 63 is the total number of cases under investigation.  As you know from other outbreaks, we use that term loosely to provide the number of people who we are doing an evaluation with.  We think that number has gone up as a testament to the diligence of our partners at the local state level, the diligence of clinicians and those two patients self-identified potentially having exposure.  Eleven negatives and two positives and the other patients’ samples are in the process of arriving or in the process of being tested here at the CDC.  As you heard from Illinois, we are rapidly working at the CDC to get those tested out where they can meet closer to the patients to really try to as quickly as possible to be able to provide diagnoses.
Issam Ahmed: Perfect, and when you get those, do you know the timeline when it will be out?
Dr. Messonnier: I would say that we are working to expedite it as quickly as possible.
Operator: This question comes from Denise Grady with the New York Times.
Denise Grady: A couple of things.  When you are following patients, I realized that you are testing but are you also looking at an incubation period and is there some period during which if the person is OK then you are figuring no problem.  Is the incubation period known yet?
Dr. Messonnier: In general, the information that we have so far suggests an incubation period around two weeks.  That’s not surprising given the kind of virus this is.  That’s a general guideline.  In terms of following, you know what really it is the state and the local health departments who are following and investigating these cases and how they proceed with that investigation partly depends on their clinical suspicion of whether this is likely to be a positive case. And so, for example, with this patient, the health department had a very high degree of suspicion and even before the diagnosis had already started to think about their initial investigations.  And I don’t know if doctor, if you want to talk about what you were doing.
 
Dr. Jennifer Layden: Sure, this is Dr. Layden.  We started to work with both, in this case before it was confirmed, the patient and others to identify any potential areas of exposures and potential close contacts and we are working closely with local health departments and the CDC to prioritize contacts.  And we’ll be monitoring through systems we developed these individuals through the extent of the incubation period.
Denise Grady: Thank you, can I ask one more just follow up on that.  When samples are sent in and tested, what are the samples and what are you testing from the patients?
Dr. Messonnier: Thank you.  We are generally testing respiratory samples, but we are also testing blood, and we are currently working to expand the kind of diagnostics we can do, but the focus right now with the real-time PCR is respiratory specimens and sometimes blood.
Operator: Next question comes from Steven Gray; your line is open.
 
Melissa Para: Thank you, this is actually Melissa Para.  I just wanted clarification on how exactly you guys are keeping track of those travelers who may have been asymptomatic when they arrive at Chicago O’Hare but may develop symptoms later on.
Dr. Marty Cetron: Now that’s a great question, and the point is well taken that these patients were asymptomatic when they arrived. We are alerting them, and we have expanded the alerts to travelers to include all travelers that are coming from any potential area, and getting the word out through a number of different outreach sources for self-monitoring as well as the vigilance, the signs, the cards, the airport screens.  The cards we are handing out say clearly, be aware to monitor your symptoms the next 14 days, and this is how to engage the healthcare system safely and have your physician report to the public health infrastructure.  So that is the current monitoring approach during this incubation period and we think that that’s a very important process.  With the ban in Wuhan, we wouldn’t expect to see if the travel ban is effective, additional cases coming in.  So, it is the last 14 days before the ban where this pool of folks we are identifying now is where that focus is.  We need to increase the vigilance and awareness of the entire system from travelers and people who gets sick and clinicians as well to be on the alert for that.  So, we are pushing that message our from several sources, and an important one is this conference right now, so you can help us actually get that message out pretty effectively.  Thank you.
Melissa Para: One follow-up question.  We are still learning more about this and symptoms can kind of range all over the place, but is it possible that you know I understand that we have non-contact thermometers at the airport, but is it possible there may be patients who may have this that don’t have a fever that may pass through that screening because they’re not showing a fever as the symptom?
Dr. Messonnier: So, I think that is entirely true and as part of what the message the Dr. Cetron was trying to give, illnesses like this have an incubation period and there can often be periods of mild illness before more serious illness occurs.  We are really still working to understand the full spectrum of illness associated with this novel coronavirus.  What our focus still is for travelers and clinicians, is the people with recent travel who have fever and respiratory symptoms and I think that really should be the focus.  Of course, the problem this time of the year is that it’s cold and flu season and there are a lot of respiratory viruses that are circulating including influenza.  But, we ask clinicians, travelers, and the entire community to be vigilant.  We want everyone to air on the side of caution if they have those symptoms, and they have a travel history, to call their healthcare provider right away.
Operator: Next question comes from Sarah Owermohle with Politico.  Your line is open.
Sarah Owermohle: Thank you.  I want to ask what kind of dialogue you guys are having with Chinese health authorities, and if that helps the understanding of when people present symptoms or when they transmit this disease to others, and the source of it as well as if there is any inkling of where it is coming from and also on the diagnostic tests you are developing.  How long is the turnaround time to definitively say this is the Wuhan virus and how much is the turnaround of people sending samples to you and the time it takes to get those to you?
Dr. Messonnier:  I am going to answer the second question first.  Once the sample is prepared at CDC, the time it takes to actually do the test is four to six hours which is a very typical time for a real-time PCR.  As you say, part of the delay is the sample getting to CDC, and entirely one of the reasons we are focusing on the possibility of getting those tests out closer to the patients so the results can become available more quickly.  For the first question, what I would say is that, CDC has a team that’s been in China for many years where we work closely with the Department of Health in China, and one of the things we have been working with them is preparedness for respiratory diseases and influenza for a long-term partnership, and in that way there is a strong collaboration.  The situation in China continues to evolve rapidly.  I think we should be clear to compliment the Chinese on the early recognition of the respiratory outbreak center in the Wuhan market, and how rapidly they were able to identify it as a novel coronavirus and publish that information and make it available for all countries, like the U.S.  That step was key for us having the diagnostics so that we could be able to identify it here.  Over the past few days, there has been a large amount of information coming out of China, we are working closer with all the global partners under the umbrella of WHO, but also directly, to synthesize that information and that’s one of the reasons we have been so clear that this situation is rapidly evolving because information is coming in hour by hour and day by day.
Operator:  Thank you, this question comes from Rob Stein with NPR, your line is open.
Rob Stein:  Thank you very much for taking my question.  I had a couple of questions, one was, can you tell us the hospital that the woman was treated at in Chicago?  Also, can you tell us anything more about where you are targeting the testing?  Are there specific places for your priorities of getting the testing out to?
Dr. Allison Arwady:  This is Allison Arwady in Chicago.  For the first question, to protect patient’s privacy when the Chicago Department of Public Health or Illinois Department of Public Health are investigating a patient with communicable diseases, we do not routinely name the hospitals where the patient sought care.  I do want to say, that we would potentially name hospitals in three situations:  Number one, if we have concern the general public may be at risk of infection; Number two, if we could not identify individuals who needed follow-up monitoring;  Or number three, if we believe there has been transmission within the hospital itself.  In this case, based on everything we that know now, none of those situations apply, so we are sticking to our standard communicable disease release.  In the interest of balancing patient’s privacy and transparency, if we have any evidence or any reasons to believe the general public is at risk of transmission in the hospital, we would share the name of the hospital at that time.
Dr. Messonnier: In terms of the second question, the prioritization of the diagnostic kits, we are working rapidly to get it to every state because we believe it is likely that many states will have patients under investigation that they’ll want to do diagnostics.  But we are certainly paying special attention to those states that have larger populations returning from Wuhan, to make sure they have that availability first.  In terms of other countries, CDC has an incredibly strong infrastructure for this exact kind of development of diagnostics, and we’ll certainly be working to make sure that we use those resources to help all the countries around the world that are in need of our help with diagnostics and in this case we are working with the World Health Organization who is coordinating a lot of those efforts.
Operator: this question comes from Dawn Kopecki with CNBC News.
Dawn Kopecki: Can you talk a little bit about the incubation period, has it been confirmed that it is a two-week incubation period?  If so, how does that compare to SARS which has an incubation period of two to seven days.  This seems to be spreading faster than SARS and although it is not as lethal.  In the first ten weeks there was about 400 and some SARS patients about there are 900 in the first three weeks with this.  So, can you talk about how this compares to SARS in terms of how contagious it is. Is it considered contagious over the two weeks period and how much more rapidly is it spreading than SARS?
Dr. Messonnier: I think I would start by saying again that it is really in the early days and we are continuing to accumulate information every day that is helping us to understand this virus.  Right now, our understanding of the incubation period is somewhere around 14 days.  I do agree with you that information of MERS and SARS was slightly shorter.  But I think it is premature to judge that as being distinctly different because we really are still in the learning phase of this novel pathogen that’s just emerged and been identified.  What an incubation period means is that is an average time that somebody takes from the time that they’re exposed to the time that they are sick. But anytime that there is an incubation period, it is not a hard and fast number.  There is always some range around it, and so that’s why the health department is being cautious in terms of identifying potential contacts.  In terms of infectiousness and severity, I think it is a little premature to absolutely say, whether it is similar or different than SARS or MERS or all the other human coronaviruses.  We are looking at that closely, and we have an approach that we take to try to compare different viruses, and we’re looking at the information we have on SARS and MERS as well as other coronaviruses, and rapidly trying to synthesize all the information from other countries, especially the Chinese data that is much more available over the last couple of days, and I hope that we’ll have more direct information about that issue soon.  But I think it would be premature to conclude that we know whether it is more or less infectious than SARS and more or less severe than SARS.  It is just too early to say that.
Operator: The last question comes from WebMD.
WebMD: Thanks.  I read in the report today that, in terms of symptoms, this is mostly lower respiratory symptoms.  Does that mean congestion so that you have difficulty breathing and perhaps pneumonia without congestion?
Dr. Messonnier: What I would say is that information is emerging, and I think the reports are useful and interesting, but it is not an accumulation of all the available data.  Early on our understanding is that, in Wuhan the case definition was somewhat narrower and focused on pneumonia, and you can hypothesize that by focusing on pneumonia you might miss milder disease.  So, our focus on this is to have a high degree of suspicion for people with fever and respiratory symptoms, and that’s how we have communicated that to our state and local partners and clinicians and returning travelers.
WebMD: Got it.  So, patients with this could have like runny nose — I am just trying to understand what the symptoms are.
Dr. Messonnier: I think that again, I would not say the patient can have, I would say that we need to continue to investigate and understand this.  Our focus on travelers and the message we want to make sure we’re getting to travelers and in the healthcare, community is that we are looking for returning travelers who have fever, cough, and respiratory symptoms.  But, if you have a suspicion and if you’re concerned because you have a fever and you returned, we want you to contact your healthcare provider.  It is better to be safe and be evaluated, and as more information becomes available, we will be communicating that.
WebMd: OK, thank you.

Haynes: Thank you, Michelle, and thank you for joining us for today’s briefing, I am joined by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases, who will provide opening remarks before taking your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Messonnier.
Messonnier: Thank you for joining us today. I’m pleased to give an update on the ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus situation in the united states. As promised, we updated our web site earlier today with our lab results.  This morning, we have 165 persons under investigation or PUIS with 68 persons testing negative and only 5 confirmed positive.  The remainder are samples in transit or being processed at CDC for testing.  We have uploaded the full genetic sequence for all five viruses detected in the united states to date, and we’re working quickly through the process to get the CDC -developed test into the hands of public health partners in the united states and internationally.  CDC is expanding entry screening to 20 U.S. Ports of Entry where CDC have quarantine stations.  Also, in collaboration with customs and border protection, CDC is expanding distribution of travel health education materials to all travelers from china.  350,000 travel education cards are ready for distribution.  The good news here is that despite an aggressive public health investigation to find new cases, we have not.  The situation in china is concerning.  However, we are looking hard here in the united states.  We will continue to be proactive.  I still expect that we will find additional cases.  Another development today, the federal government was able to successfully return a plane full of U.S. Citizens living in Wuhan, china to this country.  We have taken every precaution to ensure their safety while also continuing to protect the health of our nation and the people around them.  195 passengers have been screened, monitored and evaluated by medical personnel every step of the way, including before takeoff, during the flight, during a refueling in Anchorage, Alaska, and again in California.  Twenty CDC staff are present to help manage this process.  All of the 195 passengers are without the symptoms associated with novel coronavirus.  And all have been given assigned living quarters at the air force base.  All of the 195 have agreed to remain on base voluntarily.  CDC has now begun a second stage of further screening and information gathering from the passengers.  The passengers will be offered testing as part of this thorough risk assessment.  And samples will be sent to CDC.  We will be processing them with the appropriate speed.  I want to thank everyone who worked so hard over these past few days to bring these Americans home.  I heard that the people on board cheered loudly when the plane touched down safely in anchorage.  I want to thank those now safely returned from Wuhan for their cooperation and patience as we safeguard their health and the health of all Americans.  I understand that many people in the united states are worried about this virus and whether it will affect them.  Outbreaks like this are always concerning.  Particularly when a new virus is emerging, but we are well prepared and working closely with federal, state and local partners to protect our communities and others nationwide from this new public health threat.  At this time, we continue to believe that the immediate health risk from this new virus and the general American public is low.
Haynes: Thank you, Dr. Messonnier, Michelle, we are ready to take questions.
Operator: Our first question will come from mike stobbe with ap, your line is now open.
Stobbe: Hi, thank you for taking my call.  Yeah, thank you, doctor.  I wanted to ask you, there was a press event from Riverside, and it was a little confusing.  First of all, you used the number 195.  The number 201 has been used earlier.  Are you saying it was actually 195 people on the flight?  And the people who — from the flight, could you tell us exactly what the restrictions are for those folks at the base?  You have already said that they’ve all agreed, but there was supposed to be a three-day period, and there was some confusion about whether if someone decided they wanted to leave before three days even if there isn’t a federal quarantine order, are they allowed to do that.  And why three days?  How did you all arrive at three days if the incubation period is up to 14 days according to a paper in the “new England journal today” is five days, and the flight was supposed to go to the Ontario airport.  Whose decision was it to divert it to the air force base and why was that decision made?  Thank you.
Messonnier: Sure.  So, I know that the numbers have been confusing and as you know, we pride ourselves on precision.  Some of this is the desire to communicate quickly.  So, the correct number is 195 passengers.  It’s 195 passengers who have been screened.  Thanks also for the opportunity to clarify around what the status of the travelers are.  You know, quarantine is a regulatory authority.  It’s used to isolate someone because they pose a threat to the health of their family or their community.  In this instance, we have 195 travelers who are willingly undergoing isolation for the purpose of medical evaluation and investigation of their risk.  These passengers are happy to be back in the united states.  We at CDC are happy to help them return to their communities at the completion of their risk assessment.  All of the parties are committed to reducing the spread of this illness, so the 72 hours, you know, we hope that we will be able to assess their risk more quickly than that, get these patients through the process, after giving them perhaps a little time to rest and recuperate and we’re trying hard to make sure that we can get them on their way as quickly as possible, knowing that it may take a little while to let them rest and fully assess their risk, which is something we’re doing jointly with these passengers, so we’re hoping that you give them and us a little time to make sure that we take our time to do this risk assessment fully, but also mindful of the stress that these passengers have been under.  We also want to give them a little time to recuperate before we ask them the detailed set of questions that we think will help us help them make the appropriate risk assessment.
Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Next question will come from Eden David with ABC news medical unit; your line is now open.
David: Hi, thank you for taking the time to update us, so I understand that you are isolating these particular 195 passengers but what about the commercial flights that are still coming in from china?  You’re not isolating them or why the extra precautions for this specific — this specific subset of passengers and what would be your comment on why you’re not taking the same initiative or interventions for the commercial flights coming in?
Messonnier: Thanks for the opportunity to clarify.  These are passengers from Wuhan, and the number of travelers coming from commercial airlines from Wuhan has drastically dropped in the past days since the airport at Wuhan was closed.  So, the numbers of passengers directly coming from Wuhan drastically dropped.  We are still doing active screening of any passenger who was coming from Wuhan in the five airports where we initially set that up, and the kind of screening that we’re doing is in the same category as this screening.  It is a similar risk assessment where we’re understanding where they’ve been, who they’ve been in contact with.  Of course, looking for any medical illness and quantifying their risk into the set of categories that help us define the next steps.  These passengers are undergoing something similar.  It is more detailed, partly because of what’s been going on in Wuhan the past few days.  And because of their situation, we thought that out of the desire to make sure that they have time to rest and recuperate before they’re getting asked those questions, we wanted to make sure that they had a place where they could safely do that.  And this offers us that place.  It is in the same kind of setting that we’re offering risk assessment for other passengers coming back from Wuhan as well as anybody in the united states.  For example, the individuals who have been identified as close contacts of the confirmed patients we’re also stratifying their risk as well, and our guidance for those individuals differs based on their risk.  For example, somebody who was directly in close contact of a coughing patient with Wuhan would have a higher risk of somebody for example who passed them on the street a week before they became ill.  But all of those people are at risk, but the risk is different, and in these returning travelers, these 195 people, we want to take our time to make sure we fully assess their risk, and that we have worked with the people to do it.  Again, I want to compliment them.  I also want to thank the folks from Alaska as well as California who have been with us every step of the way.  We appreciate their patience.  As we said before, the cooperation of the patients with this novel coronavirus as well as their close contacts, as well as their — these other travelers are essential for us to be able to protect the health of these people, the health of their families and the health of the communities.
Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Next question will come from eben brown with FOX News, your line is now open.
Brown: Thank you, Dr. Messonnier, for doing the call this afternoon.  It’s been mentioned that the screening is being done at 20 airports or at 20 metro areas where the CDC has their standing quarantine stations but is it just only airports or will there or are there screening stations underway at sea ports or land-based border crossings?  I mean, it’s always possible someone could have flown from china to Cancun, got on a cruise ship and came to Miami.  Is that something that’s being addressed or what would be the criteria to start addressing those types of scenarios?
Messonnier: Sure.  Thank you.  So, I actually think it’s a great opportunity to differentiate the active enhanced screening that we were doing at the five airports for folks coming out from Wuhan from what we’re doing to enhance the screening at these 20 quarantine stations.  So as part of our regular business at those 20 quarantine stations, we look and work with customs and border protection to identify people who are returning to the united states with illness.  That is part of our regular business and at these 20 quarantine stations, what we’re actually doing is enhancing the staffing at those airports so that we can do more of that illness detection.  It’s called a standard illness protocol.  Part of our normal business, but we’re enhancing those activities.  There are two of the 18 airports actually include two land borders that are also quarantine stations and also searching those for illness response.  Detecting people that come into the united states ill is part of our normal business, and it’s relevant here, but we should remember that some of our five cases weren’t ill when they crossed back into the united states.  They became ill later.  So it’s equally important to use that opportunity and for CDC to work with cbp to provide all of these returning passengers educational materials, those educational materials specifically point out what the signs and symptoms of novel coronavirus are and we tell them if they have a fever and they have respiratory symptoms, specifically a cough, they need to contact their health care provider.  This is part of the method we use in a layered approach to try to protect all of us from any such illness that comes into the united states.
Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question will come from Richard Harris from npr.  Your line is now open.
Harris: Thanks, I’ve got two quick questions, one of which is, if these folks get screened with the CDC’s pcr test, and they call come back negative is there any biological reason to continue the 14-day surveillance of them or is that just, is that belts and suspenders up because it would seem like if everyone’s negative for carrying the virus, that would be end of story.  And the second question is about w.h.o. Which today said CDC would not be part of their new scientific efforts to go into china and learn more, and I was wondering if the CDC has any progress to report on getting a CDC team into china.  Thanks.
Messonnier: Sure.  The answer to the first question is we’re being appropriately cautious as one should be when there is a new virus with which we only have limited experience, and so we really will continue to work with these individuals to make sure that there’s appropriate monitoring.  As we’re doing for all of the — as we’re doing for all of the close contacts of the confirmed cases in the united states, and so I think it’s — I wouldn’t call it belts and suspender, I would call it an appropriate degree of caution for a new disease.  As we learn more about the disease from investigations here in CDC, as well as around the world, our procedures may change but right now we’re taking what we consider to be an appropriately proactive and cautious approach around potential contacts as well as around travelers.  In terms of the — in terms of the w.h.o., I don’t know that that’s a confirmed report, and actually, we expect that we will be invited to be part of the this w.h.o. Expert group, so we actually will, as I understand it, we are working with w.h.o.  To put together a team to go to china as soon as possible and we’ll provide an update on the team’s departure as well as activities when more information becomes available.
Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Next question will come from Erica Edwards from NBC, your line is now open.
Edwards: Hey, thank you.  I have two quick things.  One is just to clarify something that was said earlier.  I know that the number of passengers changed from 201, now to 195.  Can we assume that the other six were crew members?  And also, I’m wondering if you can say anything more about the close contacts in the confirmed cases here in the U.S., particularly that patient in Washington state?  I believe we’re at or near the end of the 14 days since he arrived back in the U.S.  Is that person still hospitalized and if so, why?
Messonnier: Yeah, so the 195 is the correct number.  The other people on the plane were state department employees, medical officers and pilots.  In terms of the clinical status of the patient in Washington state, as I said before, you would really need to direct that question to the state health department, but just know that we are actively engaged with these patients and their clinical care making recommendations to their clinicians and the health department as to how long they need to stay in hospital.  I think that as you can imagine, with a new disease, we are being cautious and I think their clinicians in their health departments are being cautious as we learn more, but those decisions will be coming from the state health department, local decisions, not from CDC, over.
Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nathan Weixel from the hill, your line is now open.
Weixel: Thanks for taking my question.  I just wanted to clarify, just about whether CDC is actually going to be part of this w.h.o.  Group, you don’t know that you’re a part of it yet or you don’t know that you’re going to china, you just expect that?
Messonnier: So, the information that I have right now is that we are invited to be part of this W.H.O. mission and that we are working with W.H.O. through the particulars of that team.  I think there are logistic questions and such about this, but again, my understanding is that there has been preliminary outreach and that CDC at this point, the plans are to include CDC as part of that team.
Haynes: Michelle, we have time for two more questions.
Operator: Our next question will come from Lisa Krieger from san Jose mercury news, your line is now open.
Krieger: Yes, hi, thank you very much.  Granted that the travel to Wuhan is the single greatest risk factor, I wonder if you could answer a reader’s questions about how do I tell the difference between, you know, symptomatically between a cold, the flu and a new coronavirus?
Messonnier: I actually think that’s a really important question for the American public because the symptoms of this disease early are fever and cough and respiratory disease, and as I think your readers astutely pointed out, that is similar to what we say as the early symptoms of influenza as well as other viral respiratory diseases.  That’s why it’s really important for Americans to know right now that the risk factors that we have identified in the united states are travel to Wuhan, but the second group of people that we’re especially concerned about are people who are close contacts of people who are traveling to — who have traveled to Wuhan, and that’s why the health department is working with CDC, have been — I’m sorry, it’s Hubei province.  You said Wuhan so I said Wuhan, but the answer is people who have recently traveled to Hubei province, and that’s all of our five cases have had that recent travel history but the second group that we’re concerned about is people who have had close contact with people who have traveled to Hubei province, and other countries that already identified cases among those groups that have had close contact with people who have traveled and that’s why we have been working with our state health departments to be very proactive and aggressive in identifying potential contact of confirmed patients and monitoring them closely.  That is, you know, we expect to see additional cases in the united states.  We think there could be in travelers returning from Hubei province but we also think that it’s likely we may have cases among close contacts of patients who have returned, that would be human-to-human transmission, so we’re expecting that, but right now, there is no sign in the united states that we have broader community transmission, and that’s why people who are not in one of those groups either traveling themselves or having close contact with a confirmed case, we don’t think those Americans need to be especially concerned, because we judged the risk in the general American public to be low.
Haynes: Last question, please.
Operator: and our last question will come from Issam Ahmed from AFP, your line is now open.
Ahmed: Hi, Nancy, just another clarifying question, so it’s the volunteer isolation period is 72 hours, and then what was the 14 days for, and I’m sorry, and will everybody have to submit a specimen or is that also voluntary, which will be tested at the CDC?
Messonnier: I’m sorry if some of this got confusing as we tried to work quickly through a complex problem.  We said it might take up to three days because we thought it might take up to that long for us to do a full risk assessment with these returning travelers and built in there some time to make sure that they also had enough time to rest and recuperate after what sounds like a difficult ordeal.  So, we said up to three days because we thought that gave us a little room to make sure that we had enough time to do all the things that we needed to do.  It’s not a specific time line.  It is just a period of time for our medical officers who evaluate each patient.  Each passenger in giving the passengers time to work things through with us as quickly as possible.  What I can say in general is that we are working with — we at CDC are working as quickly as we can to return our fellow Americans to their lives but we also want to make sure we’re doing it in a way that no one represents a risk to themselves or their families or their communities and right now, all 195 of these travelers are willing and eager to cooperate because they also want to make sure that they’re taking care of their own health, the health of their families and the health of their communities.  So, they are voluntarily cooperating with us, and in these kind of situations, that’s in general how our fellow Americans react.  They want to make sure that they’re protecting themselves and their communities and we want to compliment them on their eagerness to help, and we have full expectation that we’ll continue to have that kind of cooperation.

Ben Haynes: Thank you, Ashley and thank you for joining us for today’s 2019 novel coronavirus response update.  We’re joined by CDC Director Dr.  Robert Redfield who will provide opening remarks before turning the call over to our colleagues from Illinois.  Dr. Nancy Messonnier from respiratory diseases will provide remarks before we take your questions.  At this time, I will turn the call over to Dr. Redfield.
Dr. Robert Redfield: Thank you for joining us today.  Today in conjunction with the Illinois Department of Public Health, CDC is announcing the first instance of person-to-person spread of the new coronavirus in the united states.  Given what we’ve seen in china, and other countries with this novel coronavirus, CDC experts have expected to identify some person-to-person spread in the united states.  We understand that this may be concerning, but based on what we know now, our assessment remains that the immediate risk to the American public is low.  Our colleagues from the Illinois department of health are on the line and will provide you more information about this case of the novel coronavirus, but before I turn it over to them, I’d like to take a few moments to put this news into perspective.  Limited person-to-person spread of this new virus outside of china has already been seen in nine close contacts, infecting where travelers were infected and then transmitted the virus to someone else in the country, where these individuals had not traveled to china.  However, the full picture of how easy and how sustainable this virus can spread is unclear.  Today, news underscores the important risk dependent exposure.  The vast majority of Americans have not had recent travel to china, the high-risk areas of transmission where sustained human-to-human transmission is occurring.  Other individuals, though, that are close personal contacts of confirmed cases could have a risk, such as the case that you’ll hear about from Illinois.  It’s also important to take this moment to reinforce the importance that health care workers caring for these patients, now six in the united states, with confirmed infection, practice the strict infection control procedures that we recommend.  Let me be clear on my final point here.  Our goal of the ongoing U.S.  Public health service response is to contain this outbreak and prevent sustained spread of this virus in our nation.  This is why our response here domestically has been aggressive.  This is why we’re working with all our government partners in our state, local, tribal and territorial groups to address this outbreak.  Now I would like to hand this briefing over to my colleague, Illinois of Department of Public Health director, Dr. Ezike.
Dr. Ngozi O. Ezike: Thank you so much, Dr.  Redfield.  As mentioned, this is Dr. Ngozi O. Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health.  I would like to start by thanking governor J.P. Pritzker for his support.  I would like to thank the CDC, our local health partners in Illinois, and our health care providers for the coordinated and collaborative work on this rapidly evolving situation.  It is because of the diligent work by health professionals that we were able to identify this second case of new coronavirus in Illinois, while also taking measures to prevent others from being exposed.  This second person in Illinois testing positive for the novel coronavirus is a Chicago resident, and is the spouse of the first confirmed travel associated case in Illinois.  This second patient did not travel to china, indicating the first person-to-person transmission of novel coronavirus in the united states.  I want to echo the statements that Dr. Redfield has already shared and emphasize that the risk to the general public in Illinois remains low.  This person-to-person spread was between two very close contacts, a wife and husband.  The virus is not spreading widely across the community.  At this time, we are not recommending people in the general public to take additional precautions, such as canceling activities or avoiding going out.  While there is concern with this second case, public health officials are actively monitoring close contacts, including health care workers, and we believe people in Illinois are at low risk.  At this time, we are reporting 21 patients under investigation in Illinois.  Again, this is a rapidly evolving situation, and the status of individuals will change as we investigate.  Be assured that we are actively monitoring all close contacts, patients under investigation for symptoms.  If additional cases are confirmed, we will make sure to share that information as quickly as possible.  Again, this is not spreading widely in communities, and the general public is believed to be at low risk.  The Illinois Department of Public Health will continue to partner with the CDC, who has a team here in Illinois as well as partner with our local public health departments and health care providers, as we continue our aggressive response effort to minimize transmission, and with that, I would like to now turn it over to our state epidemiologist Dr. Jennifer Layden, who will give more specifics on the case and the investigation.
Dr. Jennifer Layden: Thank you, Dr. Ezike.  I would also like to thank our state leadership, as well as all of our public health and health care partners across the state and at the CDC.  The first Illinois case, a woman in her 60s, who returned from Wuhan, China, January 13th, is in the hospital in stable condition, and continues to do well.  Public health officials have been actively and closely monitoring individuals who had contact with her, including her husband, who had close contact for symptoms.  He recently began reporting new symptoms and was immediately admitted to the hospital and placed in an appropriate isolation room, where he is in stable condition.  We have now received lab confirmation from the CDC that he indeed has novel coronavirus.  Public health officials have been monitoring the identified potential contacts from the first patient and are additionally investigating all exposure areas such as places that were visited by the second patient to identify and communicate with potential contacts.  IDPH is working closely with our local health departments, health care partners and the CDC on this investigation, and response.  We are taking an aggressive approach in identifying and actively monitoring individuals such as health care workers, household contacts and others who were in contact with either of the confirmed cases in an effort and a goal to contain and reduce the risk of additional transmission.  We are proud of the tremendous efforts and dedication of the investigative team and are grateful for the coordination of all involved in this investigation and response.  Thank you.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Thank you, Dr. Ezike and Dr.  Layden, and I would also just like to echo CDC’s thanks to you and your staff at the state and local level for your partnership, as well as to thank the health care facility and their staff and patients in close context whose cooperation we count on.  I want to give you a short update on a few key aspects of CDC’s response.  First an update on yesterday’s screening in California. All 195 passengers continue to be medically evaluated and risk assessments are ongoing.  Second, there has been some confusion over the entry screening.  CDC does conduct ill traveler response in all 20 quarantine stations in the united states.  We are surging staff to those areas to enhance the ill traveler response capacity.  18 of those are airports, two are associated land border ports of entry.  This expansion will take some time.  We are working on logistics in the deployment of staff now, and this will take a little longer to be fully operational.  At the five active screening locations, screening will continue for any traveler from Wuhan, China, identified by CDP and referred to CDC.  In addition, everyone entering the united states from china will be given an information card with instructions on monitoring themselves for symptoms, and what to do if they develop symptoms.  Again, that is part of our layered approach to early detection and response to each case in the united states.  Last, I want to emphasize what Dr.  Redfield said. At this time, we only have six cases of novel coronavirus in the united states and we are looking very closely with our state and local partners to identify contacts of each of these cases to determine if other people might be infected.  Despite the fact that we are reporting the first instance of person-to-person spread of this virus in the united states, it’s important to note that this spread was among two people who were in close contact for an extended period of time.  We’ve seen this in other countries with this new coronavirus.  I understand how this may cause people to be worried about the virus and how it could affect them.  This is a very serious public health situation.  CDC and our state and local health partners are working to prevent community transmission from happening here.  Moving forward, we can expect to see more cases, and more cases mean the potential for more person-to-person spread.  We’re trying to strike a balance in our response right now.  We want to lean forward and be aggressive, but we want our actions to be evidence-based and appropriate to the current circumstance.  For example, CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general public.  The virus is not spreading in the general community.  While it is cold and flu season, we don’t routinely recommend the use of face masks by the public to prevent respiratory illness and certainly are not recommending that at this time for this new virus.  But I want to reiterate that everyone has a role to play, as we work together to contain the spread of this virus.  We have extensive guidance and information on our website at www.cdc.gov/ncov.  As we have said this situation continues to evolve sometimes hour by hour and day by day and our website remains the best up-to-date information.  We’d be happy to take questions.
Ben Haynes: Thank you.  Ashley, we’re ready for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session.  If you’d like to ask a question prays star one.  Please unmute your phone and record your name and affiliation when prompted.  One moment, please, for your first question.  Your first question comes from Jamie Ducharme with “time” magazine.  Your line is open.
Ducharme: Hi, I hoped that you could clarify a little bit as to the specific role that the American public can play.  I know you said that you don’t recommend wearing masks but what should people be thinking about doing as this news breaks?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Thank you.  This is Dr. Messonnier.  Two things we’re asking the public to help us with.  One is, if you are a traveler who is recently returned from the impacted area, we want you to be vigilant for the symptoms and signs of this novel coronavirus.  That is a fever and a cough and if you have those symptoms, please call your health care provider.  Similarly, if you’ve been identified by the health department as a close contact of a confirmed case, we want you to follow the guidance of the health department, that guidance is aimed to keep you safe and to keep this virus from spreading further.  For the rest of the American public right now, we understand that folks are concerned.  Our guidance is that at this time of year, the best things that you can do are the things that we generally recommend at this time of year, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.  Wash your hands, cover your cough, take care of yourself, and keep alert to the information that we’re providing, because we’ll provide new information as it becomes available.  Thank you.
Ducharme: Thank you.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please, Ashley.
Operator: Your next question comes from Leonard Bernstein with “Washington Post.”  Your line is open.
Bernstein: Thanks a lot for taking my question.  Actually, two questions.  How many contacts now do you have to trace for this couple, and could you characterize the degree of illness, their degree of illness, if the average person were looking at them, would you say that’s a very gravely ill person, that’s a person who looks like they have the flu, that’s a person who looks like they have the sniffles.  How can the public get a handle on how sick they are?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Dr. Layden or Dr. Ezike, I think that’s to you.
Dr. Jennifer Layden: Hi there.  This is Jen Layden from Illinois.  Thank you for those questions.  As far as the status of our two patients, the first patient is doing quite well, remains in hospitalization, remains hospitalized primarily for isolation.  The second patient was admitted more recently and is stable.
Bernstein: Just to follow up, could you give us an idea of what this looks like, though, what this disease looks like, the symptoms look like in an actual patient?
Dr. Jennifer Layden: We don’t want to speak to individual patient information.  I think it’s best to use data that’s come out from other places but again, I think it’s important to emphasize for these two individuals the first patient is doing quite well, and the second patient remains stable.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: This is Dr. Messonnier.  What I would say is information is still coming out but the information that has come out is consistent with what we’ve heard all along, which is that the majority of these patients start with fever and respiratory illness, cough, shortness of breath, that the patients that are having the most severe outcomes are still in older adults, and individuals with underlying illness, and that has been relatively consistent from the day they’re coming out from China, since they started early on.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Stobbe with the associated press.  Your line is open.
Stobbe: Hi, thank you for taking my call.  Could you just tell us a little bit more about this latest case?  His wife is in her 60s.  Is he also in his 60s in how old is he?  Does he or his wife have underlying illness?  Did they live in a house or apartment?  Did anyone else live with them, and could you answer the previous question a little bit more about the contacts, how many people are you interviewing or looking into as part of that contact phase in the investigation.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Dr. Layden, I know thaw are very cautious to not give out information that is private, but perhaps you could provide a little more information?
Dr. Jennifer Layden: Absolutely.  Certainly.  We can provide what we are able to share.  So, this individual is the husband of the first case, a similar age.  He does have some underlying medical conditions and will remain in the hospital.  As far as the contacts go, these two individuals had very close contact, they lived together, so sustained, prolonged close contacts.  We are working closely to identify other potential close contacts, as well as contacts in other settings that could potentially have been exposed as well.  We won’t talk to the full extent of how many, but I can say that our investigative team is looking at day by day potential exposures to identify other individuals with various levels of potential contact.
Stobbe: You said similar age, also in his 60s, and can you say what the underlying medical condition is?
Dr. Jennifer Layden: So again yes, in his 60s.  We won’t speak to the underlying medical conditions.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jacqueline Howard with CNN.  Your line is open.
Howard: Yes, thanks for taking my question.  I have two questions.  One in particular about this case.  Do we know if the woman or the patient spread the virus to her husband before she was symptomatic, and my second question has to do with testing.  We know that the incubation period for this virus is about 5.2 days, that was reported in the “New England Journal of Medicine.” Can they check the virus in the incubation phase even when cases are not showing symptoms?  Do we know that at all as well?
Ben Haynes: Nancy, why don’t you answer these questions.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Actually, the first one is probably for the state.  If you want to talk more specifically about that, what you feel comfortable talking about and I’ll take the second one.
Dr. Jennifer Layden: Yes, sure.  From what we know we believe the husband was exposed to his spouse while she was symptomatic.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: In terms of the second question about incubation period, as I said previously on these calls, the data really is coming out quickly and we need to be synthesizing it all.  The information from the article you’re talking about is a series of patients compared to the 7,700 cases that have been reported so far in china.  It is a relatively small series, important but relatively small.  We’re still using as a general principle the incubation period being somewhere between 2 to 14 days.  That is not exactly what you asked but I wanted to be clear about that.  The second question that you’re asking is, is it possible to detect this virus before somebody is symptomatic, and the answer is we don’t know yet, and we’re looking closely to see if we can.  The looking takes two distinct ways.  One is part of our looking at the contacts around these cases is taking samples from them and perhaps hoping that not only will we fulfill a public health mission by doing that but trying to learn more about how the virus is transmitted.  There also are serological tests developed in the united states and elsewhere that could potentially help us learn more about at a population level how exposure is taking place.  Finally, I guess I would say that it’s good news that there will be soon a WHO Mission in to China.  There’s much to learn from there, more detailed experience that is by far where the vast majority of cases are and hopefully looking in detail at their data will help us with this specific question which is certainly something that the public health authorities in the united states would benefit from knowing.
Ben Haynes: Ashley, we have —
Howard: if I may —
Ben Haynes: sorry, go ahead.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dennis Thompson with “Health Day.”  Your line is open.
Thompson: thank you for taking our questions.  So given that there is this transmission going on, I know that Illinois’ been a little concerned about sharing more information about the patients, but you know, at what point do you think we’re going to be able to learn more about where the hospital is where these folks are to help if for nothing else contain concern from the public?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Illinois, do you want to respond?  Somebody in Illinois or the state, do you want to respond to that question, from your perspective?
Dr. Jennifer Layden: Could you repeat the question, please?
Dr. Ngozi O. Ezike: Hi, this is Dr. Ezike.  So, the hospital for the first confirmed case was already identified by the hospital, and so since the hospital was able to identify themselves, that information is out.  We won’t get into the details of the second case.
Ben Haynes: Ashley, we have time for one more question.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Maybe I’ll just add, though, that again, from the CDC perspective, the issue of whether the public needs to know about the hospital is an important clarification.  The health care workers in the hospital are a huge priority for protection, and health department at the state and local level are working with the hospital to ensure that their workers are protected. Because we do not believe that that patient who is in isolation is at risk to his community, the health department is making the decision that that’s not information that they’re releasing right now.  Dr. Ezike, does that sound right?
Dr. Ngozi O. Ezike: That’s absolutely correct.  Thank you.
Ben Haynes: Ashley, we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Your last question comes from Kristen Thometz with WTTW news.  Your line is open.
Thometz: Hi, thank you for taking my question.  I know with regard to the first Chicago case, it was stated that the patient didn’t travel a lot upon returning from her trip to china.  I was wondering what you could talk about in terms of the second case and his movements around the community.
Dr. Jennifer Layden: Hi, this is Jen Layden from Illinois.  This is an active investigation and we continue to learn information, as we talk to the husband, as well as individuals who he has spent time with, who we will be looking at that.  He did not have travel, similar to his wife, and has had close contact with her since her return to the U.S. And we are looking at all the potential areas of exposure for him to reach out to those contacts.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: I will add to that, that we do know from extensive interviewing that he was not attending mass gatherings.  I know that would be of concern.
Ben Haynes: I’d like to thank Dr.  Redfield, Dr. Messonnier and our colleagues from Illinois.  Please remember to visit the 2019 novel coronavirus web page for continued updates and if you have further questions for CDC, please call the media line at 404-639-3286 or email media@cdc.gov.  Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today’s conference call.  You may disconnect at this time."
1587583284-140,https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0221-cdc-telebriefing-covid-19.html,"May 21, 2018",CDC,Audio Transcript,Transcript for CDC Telebriefing: Update on COVID-19,">>> Good afternoon and thank you all for standing by.  For the duration of today’s conference, all listeners are on silence mode until the question and answer section.  After that time, press star one.  Today’s call is recorded.  If you have objections, disconnect at this time.  It is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Paul Fulton.  Thank you, sir.  You may begin.
>> Thank you for joining us on the briefing of the COVID-19 response.  We’re joined by secretary for consular affairs for the department of state, Ian G. Brownlee, and Nancy Messonnier, the Director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who will give opening remarks before taking your questions.  At this time, i will turn the call over to acting assistant secretary for counselor affairs Brownlee.
>> Good morning.  I’d like to say a word about the cruise ship travel alert that the State Department posted yesterday afternoon.  U.S. Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens overseas.  February 20th, the department advised all U.S. citizens to reconsider travel by cruise ship to or within Asia.  Many countries implemented strict screening procedures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  This is a dynamic situation, and U.S. citizens traveling by ship may be impacted by travel restrictions affecting their itineraries or may be subject to quarantine procedures implemented by local authorities.  While the U.S. government has successfully evacuated hundreds of our citizens in recent weeks, such repatriation flights do not reflect our standard practice and should not be relied upon as an option for U.S. citizens under potential risk of quarantine by local authorities.  We urge U.S. citizens to evaluate the risks associated with choosing to remain in an area that may be subject to quarantine and to take all appropriate proactive measures.  People who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise ship line companies for further information on the current rules and restrictions, and should continue to monitor the travel.state.gov website for updated information.  We encourage all U.S. citizens traveling overseas to enroll their travel plans in the smart traveler enrollment program, step.state.gov.  They can receive important messages about their destination, including timely alerts and updates to travel advisories.  Finally, you can find the text of the travel alert on that same website, travel.state.gov.  Thank you very much.
>> Thank you, acting assistant secretary Brownlee.  Thank you all for joining us today.  This is Nancy Messonnier.  I want to start with how we will be reporting our cases of COVID-19 beginning today and going forward.  We are making our case counts in two tables.  One only tracks people who were repatriated by the state department, and the second tracks all other cases picked up through U.S. public health network.  CDC will continue to update these numbers every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  We are keeping track of cases resulting from repatriation efforts separately because we don’t believe those numbers accurately represent the picture of what is happening in the community in the united states at this time.  As of this morning, when you break things up this way, we have 13 U.S. cases versus 21 cases among people who were repatriated.  The repatriated cases include 18 passengers from the “diamond princess” and three from the wuhan repatriation flights.  I want to update you on the status of the repatriation efforts.  Yesterday, nearly all of the remaining people who returned from Wuhan, China, via state department chartered flights, who have been quarantined at four department of defense installations across the U.S.  have completed their 14-day quarantine.  We are truly thankful to those released from quarantine for their cooperation and patience and wish them well as they return to home, work, and school.  I want to be clear that someone who has been released from quarantine is not at risk for spreading the virus to others.  Specifically, they are not infected.  Additionally, i want to extend my thanks to the men and women on all of the dod bases and their families for their graciousness while hosting these guests.  We are also thankful that Travis Air Force Base and Joint Base San Antonio-lackland opened their doors to the recently returned passengers from the “Diamond Princess” cruise ship.  Now, the “Diamond Princess.”  329 U.S. citizens earlier this week returned to the united states aboard two state department chartered flights.  So far, 18 have tested positive at CDC.  Another 10 were reportedly positive in Japan.  11 are receiving care at the university of Nebraska medical center.  Five are receiving care around Travis.  Two are receiving care around Lackland.  Because the passengers on the “Diamond Princess” were in a close setting, where there has been a significant spread of COVID-19, they are considered at high risk for infection.  We do expect to see additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the passengers.  Additionally, since many of these people are over the age of 60, we are also prepared for other medical issues to arise that will require hospitalization.  We’re going to do everything we can to make their quarantine as easy as possible while monitoring them to see if they develop illness.  Our goal for these people who have been repatriated is to be sure that each and every person is properly cared for and that those who are in need of medical care receive it.  To ensure this, we are working closely with local hospitals as well as other facilities across the country who are prepared to provide this care.  I want to take a minute to extend my condolences to the families who have lost loved ones who were infected on the “Diamond Princess.”  we heard yesterday that two Japanese passengers of the “Diamond Princess” died.  There are several Americans with COVID-19 who are hospitalized in japan and who are seriously ill.  Sadly, we may see poor outcomes in others, not just people who were on board the “diamond princess,” but among others who become sick with this virus.  Despite the increasing cases in china and around the world, we believe our aggressive travel precautions are working.  As I said, the number of cases detected through the recent U.S.  surveillance systems has increased to 13.  The most recent patient was announced last night by Humboldt county in California.  This patient had traveled to mainland china.  The fact we have been able to keep this number low is good news, especially given what we are seeing among some countries in Asia that are beginning to experience community spread.  This is when cases are detected in a community but it is not known what the source of the infection was.  This is being reported in Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, as well as Hong Kong and Japan.  The last two countries we issued level one travel notices for earlier this week.  We are working in close coordination with the state department to keep travelers informed with up-to-the-minute guidance, including on cruise ship travel, as discussed by Mr. Brownlee.  We never expected we’d catch every traveler with novel coronavirus from China.  It would be impossible.  We’re not seeing spread here in the United States yet, but it is possible, even likely, that it may eventually happen.  Our goal continues to be slowing the introduction of the virus into the U.S.  This buys us more time to prepare our communities for more cases and possibly sustained spread.  This new virus represents a tremendous public health threat.  We don’t yet have a vaccine for this novel virus, nor do we have a medicine to treat it specifically.  We are taking and will continue to take aggressive action to reduce the impact of this virus, that it will have on the communities in the U.S.  we are working with state, local, and territorial health departments to ready our public health work force to respond to local cases and the possibility this outbreak could become a pandemic.  We are working closely with health care systems across the country to reinforce infection control principles and plans for surges of people seeking and requiring care.  We’re collaborating with supply chain partners to understand what medical supplies are needed and available.  This will help CDC understand when we may need to take more aggressive measures to ensure that health care workers on the front lines have access to the supplies they need.  We’re working with businesses, hospitals, pharmacies, clinicians, manufacturers, and distributors to communicate about these measures and what they can do to get ready.  I want to direct everyone to a document that will be very informative in terms of what people can expect in the coming weeks if the virus starts spreading in our community.  This is an MMWR recommendations and report titled “community mitigation guidelines to prevent pandemic influenza, united states–2017.”  we are reviewing the materials and adapting them to COVID-19.  These materials will serve as a blueprint for the community interventions we will use here in the U.S.  if you’re watching the news, you may be hearing about schools shutting down and businesses closing in countries in Asia to reduce the potential spread of this virus.  The day may come where we need to implement such measures in the U.S. communities.  By next week, we expect to be posting a new web page focused on what CDC is already doing to mitigate transmission in communities.  We recognize the uncertainty of the current situation.  As always, CDC public health experts strive to make the best recommendations based on the most up to date data.  Our guidance will change as we learn more about this virus.  When that happens, we will share it with you.  We’d be happy to take questions now.
>> Thank you.  If you would like to ask a question, please unmute your phone.  Press star 1, and when prompted, record your first and last name clearly so i may introduce you.  To withdraw your question, press star 2.  Again, to ask a question, press star 1.  Our first question comes from Jason Gale with Bloomberg news.  Your line is open.
>> Thanks for taking my question.  It has two parts.  We’ve heard something like 40% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in China have received corticosteroids.  Could this be worsening the disease or helping patients by calming the damaging immune response?  The second bit is, what is the worst threat, the virus or the body’s response to it?
>> This is CDC.  I would say, in general, that CDC clinical guidance does not recommend the use of steroids for this virus based on the information we have now.  I’ve also seen the reports out of China, but i would consider it to be unverified at this point.  As we’ve talked about before, folks are rushing appropriately to get information out.  Sometimes, it is difficult to know which of those have been fully reviewed.  I wouldn’t want to comment more directly on what clinical practice is or is not in china.  As many of you know, there is a team on the field now in china working specifically on this outbreak.  We, like everyone else, are waiting for the reports to come out so we can learn more about what they’re finding in china.  Also point out that there is also a WHO overseeing clinical group that is involving not just the U.S. but all the countries that are treating patients with this, so that we can be sharing experiences and using best practices that are available across the globe.  In terms of your second question, and i really do think it is premature to hypothesize why some patients are having poorer outcomes than others, but i would remind us that emergent data still says that the people who have the worst outcomes are those who are older and with underlying illnesses.  That seems to be true, continue to be true.  Next question?
>> Our next question is from Lisa Krieger with “San Jose Mercury News.”  your line is open.
>> Thank you very much.  Ten Americans tested positive in Japan, and 18 tested positive here with the CDC test upon their arrival.  Does that suggest that they were infected en route, or might be there some other explanation?
>>  This is CDC again.  What i would say is, as we said when this started, these group of people we judge to be at high risk for COVID-19 based on what the attack rates were on the cruise ship.  Therefore, it is possible that some of these people were already incubating the disease when they left japan. That is similar to, for example, what we’ve seen in just some of the travelers in the U.S.  I’ll remind you that some of the U.S. cases were asymptomatic when they came back in the U.S., and then developed symptoms several days later.  It is entirely possible that that’s what’s going on here.  I think that more information will become available over the next couple days, as we fully evaluate these repatriated travelers and as we line up the lab results from japan, as well as the testing in the united states.  So more than that, i think it is really premature to say.  Next question.
>> Actually, for state, just one clarification to that.  The positive results that you saw in folks that were repatriated either before they were transported, becoming positive or immediately upon arrival, it is important to note that those test samples were obtained 48 to 72 hours prior to the evacuation and repatriation flight.  So the results that you’re seeing don’t represent infection en route.  They actually represent infection that existed prior to the evacuation that is only now coming to light.
>> Our next question is from Lenny Bernstein with the “Washington Post.”  your line is open.
>> Thank you very much for taking my call.  Dr. Messonnier, you say you expect to see more infections from “diamond princess”  passengers.  Is that based on preliminary testing?  Is that just a prediction?  If you can say, how many more?  Is this going to be a very large number?
>> As i think you know if you’ve been listening to me give these telebriefings for weeks, i’m never going to make predictions that way.  I guess what we would say is that this was a high-risk situation.  Based on what we know about the attack rates and the exposures, we should expect to see additional cases.  Some of these passengers are still in what we would consider the incubation period, which we know to be 10 to 14 days.  Until we’re through that period, we won’t have a good feel for how many additional cases there are.  But i’m — we do think, based on epidemiology and risk assessment, that there may be additional cases.  Next question?
>> Our next question is from Luke Simmons from San Antonio.  Your line is open.
>> Thank you for taking my call.  I was wondering if you could clarify on the group that is over at Lackland.  Is that two more patients that have tested positive, not including the one that had originally come here?  Also, we had some elected officials that were concerned with them being taken, you know, for testing at the local hospitals.  It seems like you may have changed course a little bit with the Texas center for infectious disease.  I’m just wondering if you can kind of clarify what that process is once you guys, you know, start testing in this type of incident.
>> I’m going to maybe answer the second question first.  So as we’ve said with these repatriated groups, our assessment of the groups, in terms of their risk, drives our stance in terms of what kind of testing we do.  So because these returning passengers — because these repatriated individuals were judged to be at high risk, we have done additional testing on them.  It is — in addition to that testing, we also are continuing to do surveillance for illness, which is clearly our focus.  Identifying people that are ill and making sure they are getting appropriate treatment so they don’t have poor outcomes.  When somebody is identified as being ill, those are the folks that are being hospitalized, if that’s what you’re asking me.  So there are people who are in quarantine.  There are people who are in local hospitals.  They’re getting care.  Is that what you’re asking me?
>> Yes.  Well, and also, it just seems like, you know, some of the elected officials were concerned about the testing itself, making sure that that was happening at lackland.  They didn’t necessarily need to go to a hospital at that point.  And then can you also talk about the texas center for infectious disease?  Is that where you plan to take these people now who are testing positive, and not just local hospitals, you know, with the general population?
>> I would say we probably need to defer back to dod for this.  But in every situation, we’re trying to make the best decision possible for the health of these individual patients.  In each of these bases, and each of these situations, the individual patient level decisions end up being a little bit different as we make those decisions with the health department and with the dod, folks that have been kind enough to let us keep the passengers on these bases.  Our focus is on the individuals, again, making sure they’re getting the care possible, but also we want to make sure that the rest of the communities, as well as the folks on the dod bases, also are assured of their own safety.  So working those issues together, each individualized situation ends up being a little different.  Next question.
>> Our next question is from John Woolfolk from “Bay Area News Group.”  your question?
>> Thank you, doctor.  I have to ask you to go over the numbers of infections, both from the previous cases and the “diamond princess.”  you talk awful fast.  If you could clarify, have you subtracted from the total the two that we know of that have been declared recovered, or is that still being counted in?  And is this new case out of Humboldt County in California being added to that?  If you could just go over the numbers of who is infected, that would be a big help.
>> Yeah.  And i am sorry for going through those quickly.  What i would start by saying is that the numbers should be up on the CDC website within the hour.  Because it is a little complicated to work through the details.  Let me start by saying that if you’re a case, you remain a case.  Even if you recover, you remain a case.  We’re not subtracting cases.  The patient from Humboldt County who was announced overnight should be added into those numbers.  If, for example, somebody was identified as being a confirmed case this afternoon, that number won’t be posted until Monday.  That’s the distinction, you know.  We pick a time to post our numbers.  It is Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  We are separating out the folks that are repatriated because we think they really do — are a separate category, and that it doesn’t reflect transmission and risk in general in the U.S.  so what you’ll see us separating is the U.S. cases versus the cases among repatriated individuals.  Those are in two groups.  The first set of repatriated  individuals are the folks who came back from Wuhan on the repatriated flights.  There are three patients that are confirmed COVID-19 associated with their flight, those flights.  Then there are the repatriated folks from the “diamond princess.”  that also will be a separate category.  So far, that number is 18.  We are still trying to adjudicate the Japanese results, as well.  So we likely will be including in that number, eventually, patients that were confirmed in japan.  We’ll really try to make sure, on our website, to post those numbers differently.  Bottom line is, there is one new U.S. case since our last briefing, which was a week ago.  Then there is a separate category of folks that were on the “diamond princess.”  we will continue to keep those numbers separately.  Please, within the hour, it’ll be on the website and hopefully make it clearer.  Next question.
>> Our next question is from Julie Steenhuysen from Reuters.  Your line is open.
>> I have a couple questions.  First of all, can you tell us how many states have testing capacity?  We’re hearing that only three states at the moment are capable of testing for the coronavirus because of issues with the test kits.  And secondly, and you touched on this, at what point does it make sense to still screen passengers at airports, given how many countries now are seeing widespread — or seeing additional cases and starting — you know, at what point do you shift to community-based measures to control this virus?  Thirdly, do — where do we stand in our understanding of whether this virus is spread in asymptomatic patients?  Thank you.
>> So i have to say that i thought that this was one question and one follow-up, but i will try —
>> I know.  Sorry.
>> In terms of the test kits, you know what, i think we’ve been as transparent as one could be about this issue.  I’m happy to report that we’re fully stood up at CDC.  There is no lag time for testing at this point.  That is the focus of testing in the united states, the testing here at CDC.  We’ve had no issues at all in terms of the quality of that.  As we’ve pushed tests out to the state, they did what we would expect as part of the normal procedures, which is do the verification in their own laboratories.  There were problems identified with the test kits.  That is a normal part, unfortunately, of these processes.  We obviously would not want to use anything but the most perfect possible kits, since we’re making determinations about whether people have COVID-19 or not.  So that is still where we are.  We are working with FDA, who is the one that have oversight over us.  Under this e.u.a. on redoing some of the kits.  We still consider it a priority to get the kits out to patients as soon as possible.  It is overridden by the priority to make sure that the test is correct.  The second question is about screening.  I guess what i would say in general is that if you look at global data, the focus still of most of the cases is in china and, specifically, in wuhan.  That is why the layered approach that the U.S. government has put in place has focused on those places at higher risk.  We continue to reevaluate this.  Screening at the airport is two different things.  There is routine screening for any passenger coming back with — CDC works with them on it, and it is screening ill people returning from overseas.  That’s routine.  That’s ongoing. That is not driven by these countries separately.  We do have focused efforts focused on people returning from china.  We continue to look at those efforts to make sure the focus is appropriate, given where the burden of disease is, and given where transmission is.  We still think that, as of today, that is the right focus.  It is also important for you to realize, that’s not all we’re doing.  In addition to what’s going on at the airports, we have clinicians all over the country on the lookout for patients.  We have patients who are traveling, getting information from us as to potential risk, so that they can be part of this — of the important work of identifying cases in the U.S.  we also haven’t — this is not a turn on, turn off way of approach.  That is, we’re often doing community surveillance.  The reason we’ve moved quickly to stand up community surveillance is with the understanding that we want to make sure that we also have other ways, outside of just travel-associated screening, to look for cases in the U.S.  that is starting at a few sites, but we’re rapidly working to make that all over the united states.  It will be community-level surveillance for patients ill with respiratory diseases, so that we can also look at a community level, both to make sure our screening is still focused appropriately, and also with the understanding that there is still the possibility in the future that this is going to spread.  The final question is asymptomatic disease.  There is certainly more data coming out that suggests that there are people who are reportedly asymptomatic who have this virus with the swab.  We need to fully understand what that means in the individual patients.  Are those patients, for example, that are being caught early, that may eventually go on to get disease?  How hard are folks looking to ask them for symptoms?  In other similar illnesses, we have found that if you dig deeper, you actually find many of these patients can recall some sort of mild symptom.  I don’t think there is anything especially new about our posture on this.  We are still gathering information.  When it is enough information to impact how we operationalize, we obviously will make sure all our partners, as well as the public, knows it.  Next question.
>> We have time for two more questions.
>> Our next question is from Dan Vergano with “Buzzfeed” news.  Your line is open.
>> Thanks.  I wanted to ask the state department official about some of the reports that there might be a spread or outbreak in Iran, and whether our status with them, UN sanctions, would prevent us from aiding that country, or any other with UN  sanctions, in the case of stopping an outbreak for medical help.  As a follow-up, i wanted to clarify, was there a disagreement between CDC and state department about the passengers transferred back to the U.S. from the cruise ship?  Thanks.
>> This is CDC.  I’ll take the reports out of Iran in terms of cases.  You can answer the second question.  So, you know, as folks know, at CDC, we look carefully at both formal reports from other countries, as well as rumors.  There have been emerging reports informally of additional cases in Iran.  Some of that isn’t confirmed yet.  I expect this will be something that we are looking at and talking about over the next couple days.  It’s a little premature right now.  Really, that data is new as of today, and we need some time to evaluate it.  I would also say that this is something where, obviously, we’re working closely with the World Health Organization.  State Department, I’ll leave the next question to you.
>> This is Dr. Walters from the State Department.  With regard to decision making during the evacuation, it is important to remember that this was an emerging and unusual circumstance.  We had 328 people on buses.  We had a plan.  We were executing the plan.  Then we received lab results on otherwise asymptomatic, un-ill people that were on their way to an airport.  I think the folks on the ground did just the right thing by, out of an abundance of caution, moving those 14 people into an isolation area where they pose no threat to themselves or anyone else.  It provided room for an inter-agency discussion between not just CDC and state but the operational elements of HHS, which were from the assistant secretary of preparedness and response.  At the end of the day, the state department had a decision to make, informed by our inter-agency partners.  We made ahead and made that decision.  The decision, i think, was the right one, in bringing those people home.
>> This is CDC.  Maybe i’ll just add that, you know, these are difficult decisions that we’re faced with every day.  We’re making those decisions in real time.  When you make those kind of complicated decisions, there are going to be different perspectives that are brought to the table.  We are one U.S. government working together, and we will continue to operate under that stance, as we have forever, since this started and as we will into the future.  Our focus is on, right now, the forward-looking health of these repatriated citizens, and to continue to manage the response seamlessly within the government.  Next question.
>> Our next question is from Andrew Joseph.  Your line is open.
>> Hi.  Following up on some of the testing questions.  Has testing started through the influenza network yet?  Also, you mentioned, you know, how clinicians are on the lookout for patients.  Have you all thought about broadening the recommendation?  As it stands now, i think online, it’s either fever and — or sorry, symptoms and either travel history to wuhan or contact with a confirmed case or person or investigation.  As you mentioned, it seems to be spreading pretty efficiently outside Wuhan.  Have you thought about expanding that evaluation guideline?  Thank you.
>> Certainly, our plan. I’d like to under promise and over deliver, but we expect it to be on track for next week.  In terms of case definition, you may know that on our web page we do go through in detail our current case definition.  The current case definition does say that patients that have fever, symptoms of lower respiratory infection, requiring hospitalization, and a history of travel from mainland china meet the case definition for testing.  We are regularly looking at the epidemiological situation globally.  With our state and local health department partners, evaluating our case definition to make sure it is sensitive and specific enough.  We will continue to do that.  Including conversations today on this issue.  We are certainly sensitive to the question of when and if this starts spreading more broadly in communities globally, how that impacts how we define a patient under investigation here in the U.S.  We want to make sure that we’re targeting our efforts appropriately.  We also obviously don’t want to mistransmit in the United States.  Balancing those things going forward, we are going to continue to look at travel history and see when and if there’s the right reasons to expand that beyond China.

HAYNES: Thank you Holly.  And thank you for joining us for this briefing to update you on CDC’s 2019 Novel Coronavirus response.  We are joined today by Dr. Nancy Messonnier Director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and rear admiral Denise Hinton from the food and drug administrations, she is the chief scientist.  Dr. Messonnier and rear admiral Hinton will give opening remarks before taking your questions.  At this time I’ll turn the call over to Dr. Messonnier.
MESSONNIER: Thank you for joining us today.  Today I would like to provide a few updates on important developments in the last couple days.  Since we briefed you last, there have been no new confirmed novel coronavirus infections.  The total number of confirmed positives in the united states remains at 11.  Right now, 206 persons under investigation  or PUIs have tested negative for infection with this Novel virus.  And we currently have testing pending on 76 PUIs.  Some of those PUIs that are pending include samples in transit.
As we alluded to earlier this week and was reported by many of you last night, FDA signed the emergency use authorization or EUA for our diagnostic test. Today the test kits will start shipping to the over 100 US public health labs, each of these labs is required to perform international verification for CLIAA compliance prior to reporting out.  This process is expected to take a few days.  Initially 200 test kits will be distributed to US domestic laboratories and another 200 will be distributed to selected international laboratories.  Each test kit can perform 700 to 800 patient samples.  What that means is that by the start of next week, we expect there to be much enhanced capacity for laboratory testing closer to our patients.  Additional test kits are being produced and will be made available for ordering in the future from the International Reagent Resource or IRR. At this time each laboratory that places an order will receive one 2019 NCOV test kit.  Distribution of these tests will improve the global capacity to detect and respond to this new virus as well as greatly enhance our national capacity.  Availability of this test is a starting place for greater commercial availability of diagnostic testing for ncov.  States will now start testing for confirming this virus and you may start hearing from states directly about confirmed cases.  As always, their case count will be the most up-to-date.  CDC will continue to report case counts on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays on our website.  US public health system relies heavily on the work of state, local and territorial health departments who are on the front lines of outbreak responses.  Their ability to detect and confirm this virus is critical.  We appreciate the dedication and cooperation the state, local, and territorial health departments have shown in the last month as we’ve developed and cleared this test for use in the United States. As we collaboratively worked aggressively to slow the spread of this virus here in the United States.   And I especially want to make sure to stop and thank our colleagues and leadership at the FDA who has helped to make this possible.
Now I want to give you an update on another activity.  There are four more planes carrying passengers from Wuhan, China back to the United States.  The plan is for the planes to arrive at the following locations in three states, Travis Air Force Base in Sacramento, California, marine corps air station Miramar in San Diego, California, Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas and Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska.  CDC staff are there meeting the planes and assessing the health of each passenger.  The passengers will be screened, monitored and evaluated by medical and public health personnel including before takeoff and during the flight.  Medical care will be readily available at the first onset of symptoms, if needed.  Like the plane that arrived in March Air Reserve base last week, these passengers will be issued quarantine orders upon arrival at their designated locations.  This legal order is intended to protect the travelers, their families and their communities.  The quarantine period will begin the day the flight leaves Wuhan and will continue for 14 days.  We do not believe these people pose a threat to the communities where they are being housed. As we are taking measures to minimize any contact.  We expect confirmed infections among these and other returning travelers from Hubei province.  The measures we are taking may not catch every single returning traveler returning with Novel Coronavirus given the nature of this virus and how it is spreading but if we can catch the majority of them, that will slow the entry of this virus into the United States.  In addition to these measures, we have a strong public health system that is on high alert to detect this virus in the health care system.  We’ll continue to monitor this situation and adjust accordingly either pulling back or strengthening these measures.  As the WHO Director General Tedros said yesterday, “We have a window of opportunity.”  Almost all the confirmed cases with the Novel Coronavirus are in China and the majority of those are in Hubei province, but there have been more than 200 infections detected in 28 locations outside of China including the United States.  Now is the time to act so that we can slow the introduction and impact of this virus in the US.  The Federal Government and public health systems have been preparing for an outbreak like this for years.  All of the pandemic planning that we have done for influenza is the foundation for our response to this virus.  There are different outbreak stages and different interventions used for the various stages.
This is the beginning of what could be a long response.  Right now we’re aggressively intervening to contain introduction into the United States.  If community spread in the US  is established, we’ll implement broader measures to mitigate the impact of the virus on our communities.  More than 800 people are working on this response at CDC alone including nearly 200 people working at the airports, department of defense bases and in states assisting their investigations.  CDC’s full expertise in infectious disease and preparedness is being brought to bear for this response.  We are helping prepare health care systems and clinicians, by providing them with guidance and resources on how to protect themselves and others. We develop guidelines for the clinical management of patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus. We’re providing direct consultation of frontline clinicians in the US caring for 2019 and Cov patients which will also further our understanding of the disease and improve guidance.  We’re working with health care and industry partners to understand the supply chain for personal protective equipment.  We’re putting the tools into place to help reduce the burden public health and health care facilities face when monitoring individuals at risk for this new virus.  Those are just some of the things that we’re doing and the list is much longer.  But despite the years of planning, we need to remain humble and understand that we may not have planned for everything.  We expect to see additional cases of Novel Coronavirus in the United States among returning travelers as well as their close contacts.  We recognize the uncertainty of the current situation.  As always, CDC public health experts strive to make the best recommendations – US public  health experts strive to make the best recommendations based on the most up-to-date data. Which will continue to inform our guidance. And i’d like to turn the call over to rear admiral Denise Hinton, the food and drug administration’s chief scientist talk about the UA.
HINTON: Thank you, Dr. Messonnier, for those important updates and for the continued collaboration. My name is Denise Hinton, and I do serve as the FDA’s chief scientist and today I want to provide just a few updates on the work the FDA has been doing.  The FDA continues to work closely with our international, federal, state and local partners as quickly as possible to gather more information about this public health threat.  FDA has been working very closely with the CDC and other U.S.  government partners reviewing data as its in real time and with a team working around the clock to ensure tests are available under emergency use authorization or eua.  This is to enable the CDC to distribute the test as soon as it is available.  Yesterday the FDA, as of February 4, 2020, issued an eua to enable emergency use of the CDC’s 2019 Ncov diagnostic test.  To date this test has been limited to use at CDC laboratories.  Yesterday’s authorization allows the use of the test at any CDC qualified lab across the country as Dr. Messonnier had stated.  Additionally, FDA announced that it had developed an eua review template to test and detect the novel coronavirus which outlines the data to be developed in a pre-EUA package which is available to developers upon request.  As of February 5, 2020, today, FDA has sent the template to 35 diagnostic developers.  The FDA is committed to expediting the development and availability of critical medical products to prevent, diagnose and treat 2019 nCOVusing all applicable regulatory authorities to respond to the outbreak.  Thank you for your time.  And we’re open for any questions.
HAYNES: Thank you, Admiral Hinton, and thank you Dr. Messonnier.  We are ready to open it up for  questions.
OPERATOR: Thank you.  If you would like to ask a question, please unmute your phone, press *1 and when prompted record your first and last name clearly so I may introduce you.  To withdraw your question press *2. Again, to ask your question press *1.  Our first question comes from Betsy McCaughey from the New York Post, your line is open.
NY POST: Thanks for taking my call.  My question is about the national stockpile.  How well prepared is the U.S. to provide hospitals with masks, gowns, gloves, face shields and other personal protective equipment if in fact for at least one or two regions in the country there is a real demand for that?  And secondly, is our reliance on china as the manufacturer of a lot of this equipment a weak link?
MESSONNIER: I guess that is for CDC.  And one thing that I will say is as many of you know, the national stockpile is actually under ASPA now not under CDC, but in general you bring up an important point which is is the current risk to the American public is low, but as we project outward with the potential for this to be a much longer situation, one of the things that we’re actively working on is projecting the long term needs for our health care system and certainly one of those important projections is personal protective equipment with a priority certainly for our health care workers.  So, it is something that we are very much working on with additional meetings today about it.  And hopefully we’ll have more to say about this in the coming days.  But it is also a good reminder for me to tell folks that as we anticipate the potential for this, we want to make sure that when those personal protective equipment, masks and especially masks but also gowns and gloves are being used, they are being used appropriately to keep our staff and health care workers safe, but not excessively.  Because we may need to be preserving them for later when the risk is higher.  So, as I said, before we do not think that the American public should be going out and buying masks, we don’t think that normal U.S.  citizens going about their day to day lives in the u.s. right now are at risk.  And so, I would definitely caution people to be patient as we work through these longer-term issues, but to understand that our guidance to folks now is let’s make sure that we have enough of those personal protective equipments for the folks at highest risk and specifically our health care workers.
And I would say that that is something that we’re actively working on and part of what we need to sort out is our expectations for how long this will last.  If this is something that will be over quickly, obviously that projection looks a lot different than if it is something that will last a longer time.  And as we’re learning more about the situation in china, about how transmission is happening, how it is being spread, it will help us to better do those projections in the united states which again is something that we’re actively working on.
HAYNES: Next question, please.
OPERATOR: Next question is from John Woolfolk with san Jose mercury news.  You may ask your question.
SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS: Can you tell us how this is — the people at Travis and the other places are being cared for, what they are doing when they are there, what kind of protections or restrictions or being imposed on the people caring for them, like can they leave and go home?
MESSONNIER: The folks that are at Travis air force base who returned from Wuhan are under quarantine.  And that means that they can’t just walk out and return home.  The decision to quarantine them was not an easy decision, but it was based on our understanding of the location that they came from and our calculation of their risk of getting novel coronavirus and the potential risk of them passing it on to their families and their communities.  What does it look like to be under quarantine?  It means that there is an area where they are, they have housing units and I think that they are going about daily lives there the best that they can.  I understand from the folks on the ground that in general they are grateful to be home and have been cooperative, but we know this is not an easy thing we are asking them to do and we appreciate their cooperation because it is really essential.  I will also point out that they are getting medical evaluations again as part of the normal course of action.
HAYNES: Next question, please.
OPERATOR: Next question is from Dawn Kopecki with CNBC. Your line is open.
CNBC: Hi, could you talk a little about the trajectory for this illness as it pertains to mortality rates.  So, we know that it can take up to two weeks to show symptoms.  How long after that are you seeing it take the virus to become deadly enough to end up in fatalities?  In other words, we’re a month into this.  If it takes two weeks to show symptoms and another week to three weeks until someone is sick enough to pass away, how does that affect the mortality rate that we’re seeing today?
MESSONNIER: That was a complicated question, but I think that I understand what you are asking.
So, let me start by saying that it is really important for folks on this call to understand that the 11 u.s. patients are as far as I know at this moment actually all doing well and the ones that were a little sicker have actually improved.  So I’m happy to report that the u.s. patients, the ones that are here, are actually really doing well.  I think what are you more talking about is the data coming out of china and what you are asking is the time — whether the case fatality ratios are being delayed because they are actually getting sicker later.  I can’t answer that concretely because I don’t think that we have the data, however we also should be cautious in interpreting the data about a  severity of illness including fatality or death in china right now because we know that early on in the response their case definitions were likely to focus on patients who had pneumonia and the disease and we know from experience with many other outbreaks that it tends to be early on that patients who are — [ inaudible ] more likely to seek medical care and be diagnosed.  So I don’t think that we can say fully whether the 2%, which is where — it is 2% that has been relatively stable of the patients being reported out of china who have died, but whether that actually is a real case fatality ratio or not, I just don’t think that we have the information right now to say.  But I would say again that what we know is that this disease can be deadly.  There have been two deaths outside of china and we’re definitely watching our u.s.  patients carefully because of course we know that death is possible with this severe disease.
HAYNES: next question, please.
OPERATOR: The next question is from Colleen Shalby with the “los Angeles times.”
LA TIMES: Thanks for taking my question.  I have two questions for you.  One, I’m wondering if you can explain a bit the decision to quarantine now versus not to quarantine during the swine flu which had about 60 million cases.  And 2, we know that there was a minor taken to the hospital yesterday after developing a fever at march air reserve base.  I’m wondering if you have any update on that.
MESSONNIER: The second one was about a child from — can you repeat that again?
LA TIMES: Yeah, second one was about a child who developed a fever at march air reserve base who was taken to a hospital yesterday.  I’m wondering if you had any update on that.
MESSONNIER: Let me take the second one first.  You know, as we’ve talked about, the reason that we are quarantining people is that we do think that they are at higher risk for novel coronavirus based on the fact they came from this area where the attack rates are high and still rising.  So, we should not be surprised if there are some cases among the people who have already returned or among the additional planeloads of people coming back.  That being said, this is a child with a fever.  And those of you who have  children know that there are many reasons why children have fever.  And we need to let the evaluation progress.  There are laboratory tests that are being taken and being evaluated.  And as soon as we have a concrete answer on that child, we’ll let you know.  As far as I understand, the child is actually doing pretty well.  We should be happy for that.  In terms of the second question, what I say in general is that every one of these situations is different and we have to evaluate it differently.  There have been other occasions where the question of quarantining have come up.  Within my career 25-year career at CDC, there have been situations where this has come up and what was different about this one is that the outbreak was caught so early before it really got to the united states.  And the comparison I made on the last teleconference, h1n1, where by the time we caught it, it was already at our borders.  But this is a situation where hopefully because of improved global capacity and surveillance and lab capacity, it was caught early before it spread around the world and we had this window of time in which they could intervene to slow it down.  I think that is different from other situations that we faced.
HAYNES: Next question, please.
OPERATOR: next question is from Johnathan Serrie with fox news.  Your line is open.
FOX NEWS: Thank you for taking my question. Dr. Messonnier, for the passengers quarantined last week at march air reserve base, is there a specific date for their reviews, in other words, will all be released on the same day 14 days since departing china?  What criteria must they meet to be released from quarantine and what will the process look like?
MESSONNIER: Yeah, to count 14 days from the day that they left and i understand that that is February 11th — i hope that i did that correctly.  As long as they are healthy and their immediate family is healthy, our plan is to release them and help them get to their final destinations to their families.  If they are sick or their family members are sick, we need to make sure that they are not sick with coronavirus.
FOX NEWS: And if i could follow up, once they are released and reunited with their family, will there be any additional guidance, will they isolate in their homes or be declared completely free to go back into the mainstream society?
MESSONNIER: As of today, based on what we know about this virus, the incubation period, the far outside of it is 14 days which means that if they reach 14 days without getting illness, we would consider them to be free of disease and ready to go back to their normal lives.  Of course if additional information becomes available, we’ll let you know.  But right now our plan is to wish them well and let them get on with their lives.
HAYNES: We have time for two more questions.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the “washington post.”
WASHINGTON POST: I have two questions and a followup.  You were working on the guidance or what was going to happen with the quarantine and i was wondering if you could bring us up-to-date on the commercial flights where all these people will be housed because there have been a couple people who have been quarantined already.  And the second question has to do with the virus.  There are reports from china today of babies being infected with vertical transmission.  And i’m wondering if there is any additional information cdc has gotten from other countries where they have cases where maybe the sharing of data has been a little bit more transparent about transmission if there is anything else that you can add about vertical transmission.
MESSONNIER: Thanks.  So the first question that you are asking is about the individuals that have come back on commercial flights and have been found to be from wuhan.  As i said last time, we are working directly with each state and local health department on plans for each individual that has returned who would need to be quarantined.  At this point i will not be releasing specific information about each of those state’s plans or about individual patients who may have been quarantined.  We hope in the future to at least provide you some information about the number of people.  But that is not something that i’m at liberty to talk about today.  And the second question, like you, we have read with interest this report of neonatal vertical transmission coming from china.  For respiratory virus, it would be pretty unusual.  However, as we’ve said all along, there is a lot about the novel coronavirus that we don’t know and that report just came out i think within the past couple hours.  So i don’t think that we know any more than you do.  But we are actively looking for a confirmation.  I’ve heard of no similar reports.  This is the first such report that we’ve seen.
HAYNES: Last question please.
OPERATOR: Last question is from carla johnson, a.p.  your line is open.
AP:  Thanks for taking my question.  Are you ready to express any change in confidence about this situation globally perhaps about the potential for efforts working and there not being a lot of spread outside of china, or from pre-symptomatic people, any indication that this has reached a peak and efforts are being successful?  And my second question is, how many people are on those four planes from wuhan and exactly when will each be landing at the military bases that you have identified?  Thanks.
MESSONNIER: The answer to the first question, i think that this comes down to need to be humble.  Of course we’re looking at the data and trying to answer exactly the question that you are asking.  I don’t think that we’ve seen that right now there is any sign that this has stopped.  I think that it is premature to comment on whether it has slowed down.  But we do believe that we have a window of opportunity now to prepare the united states in case that there is a broader spread of this outside china as well as a broader spread in the united states.  And so as i said before, we’re preparing as if this is a pandemic.  That is just good common sense public health.  But of course i’m hoping that it is not.  In terms of the planes, what i can tell you is that two either have landed or are landing today and the other two will be landing tomorrow.  And i don’t have an exact count yet of the number of people on those planes.  We’ll have that after all four have landed and we can provide that information in follow up.
HAYNES: thank you Dr. Messonnier.  And i’d also like to thank admiral hinton for joining us.  Please remember to visit the 2019 novel coronavirus website for continued updates.  And if you have further questions, call the main media line at 404-639-3268 or email media@cdc.gov.  Thank you.

Ben Haynes: Thank you, Sarah.  And thank you all for joining us for this briefing to update you on the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Response.  We’re joined today by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and Dr. Marty Cetron, Director of CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.  They will update you on CDC’s response to this novel coronavirus.  Dr. Messonnier will give an update before taking your questions.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Thank you for joining us today.  Yesterday the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International C oncern for this novel coronavirus outbreak, which has demonstrated the capacity to spread globally.  This is a very serious public health situation, and CDC and the Federal Government has and will continue to take aggressive action to protect the public.  We are coordinating closely across HHS with the whole of government and the White House.  If we take strong measures now, we may be able to blunt the impact of the virus on the United States.  Here are the facts as we know them today.  Every day this week China has reported additional cases.  Today’s numbers are a 26% increase since yesterday.  Over the course of the last week, there have been nearly 7,000 new cases reported.  This tells us the virus is continuing to spread rapidly throughout China.  The reported deaths have continued to rise as well, and additional locations outside China have continued to report cases.  There has been an increasing number of reports of person-to-person spread.  And now most recently, a report from the new England journal of medicine of asymptomatic spread.  While we still don’t have the full picture and we can’t predict how this situation will play out in the U.S., the current situation, the current scenario is a cause for concern.  I understand how this may cause people to be worried about this new virus and how it could affect them.  We must be proactive and aggressive, but we want to reassure you that our actions are evidence-based and, we believe, appropriate to the current circumstances.  At this moment CDC staff are speaking with the repatriated individuals in California to let them know that CDC under statutory authority of the HHS Secretary has issued federal quarantine orders for all 195 passengers.  The quarantine will last 14 days from when the plane left Wuhan, China.  This decision, which has been deliberated at CDC by our most expert staff with previous experience working on multiple outbreaks and pandemics, is based on the current scientific facts.  While we recognize this is an unprecedented action, we are facing an unprecedented public health threat.  And this is one of the tools in our toolbox to mitigate the potential impact of this novel virus on the united states.  This legal order is part of an aggressive public health response, the goal of which is to prevent, as much as possible, community spread with this novel virus in the united states.  This legal order will also protect the health of the repatriated individuals and protect their families and their communities.  These individuals will continue to be held at the March Air Reserve Base in Ontario, California.  We do not believe their presence on the base poses a threat to the residents of Ontario.  This is a respiratory virus, which means it’s spread through things like respiratory droplets.  Medical staff will continue to monitor the health of each traveler including temperature checks and observation for respiratory symptoms.  Medical care will be readily available at the first onset of symptoms.  Even if an initial screening test comes back negative from CDC’s laboratory, it does not guarantee these individuals will not get sick.  We are preparing as if this were the next pandemic, but we are hopeful still that this is not and will not be the case.  This is the first time in over 50 years that CDC has issued a quarantine order.  While we understand this action may seem drastic, our goal today, tomorrow, and always continues to be the safety of the American public.  We would rather be remembered for overreacting than underreacting.  I want to reiterate that everyone does have a role to play as we work together to contain the spread of this virus.  Stay informed.  CDC is updating its website daily with the latest information and advice for the public.  Remember to take everyday preventive actions that are always recommended to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses.  We do not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general American public.  This virus is not spreading in your communities.  While it is cold and flu season, we don’t routinely recommend the use of face masks by the public to prevent respiratory illness, and we are certainly not recommending that at this time for this novel virus.  We understand the recent recommendations are concerning.  The actions of the Federal Government – the actions that the Federal Government is taking are science-based with the aim of protecting the health and safety of all Americans.  Please do not let fear or panic guide your actions.  For example, please do not assume that just because someone is of Asian descent that they have this new coronavirus.  There are about 4 million Chinese-Americans in this country.  We recognize the uncertainty of the current situation.  As always, CDC public health experts drive to make the best recommendations on the most up-to-date data which will continue to inform our guidance.  We have extensive guidance and information on our website at www.cdc.gov/ncov.  We’d be happy to take your questions at this time now.
Operator: Thank you.  At this time if you would like to ask a question, please press star one.  Please be sure to unmute your phone and record your name at the prompt so that I may introduce you for your question.  Also please limit to one question and one follow-up question.  Once again, it is star-one to ask a question.  Our first question comes from Denise Grady with New York Times, your line is now open.
Denise Grady: Thank you, Dr. Messonnier.  The question I’d like to ask, just to be absolutely certain of why this is being done now rather than it hasn’t been done with any of the people who came in on planes before.  Is it because of the increased spread in China and also because of the asymptomatic spread?  Are those really what prompted it?  And did this decision originate within CDC, or did it come from some other level of government?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Thanks for that question and the opportunity to clarify.  This outbreak continues to evolve day by day, and every one of these teleconferences we’ve said that as new information becomes available, we’ll have to re-evaluate our guidance.  As we have proceeded through this very long week, what has become clear is that the magnitude of the scope – magnitude and scope of this epidemic in China is increasing, and the epicenter of it continues to be Hubei.  While flights from Hubei have decreased since the closure of the airport in Wuhan, these returning travelers are coming directly from the epicenter.  So, it is their where they are coming from.  But in addition, the emerging evidence this week of the growth and spread of this outbreak, the increase in deaths, and the incoming data about person-to-person transmission as well as concerning reports about asymptomatic spread.  All of that data taken together has led CDC to make evidence-based recommendations, and this has been driven from the perspective of CDC by scientifically evidence-based recommendations from CDC experts who have been working on exactly these kinds of issues for many years.  So, I’ll stop there.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Next question comes from Andrew Joseph with STAT.  Your line is open.
Andrew Joseph: Hi, yeah.  Can you just explain a little bit scientifically how a test can come back negative, and maybe the person still has a virus, or might get sick later?  And how does the report of asymptomatic transmission from Germany, how is that changing sort of broader U.S. response beyond this quarantine measure?  Thanks.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Sure.  And I think it’s really important to clarify, because I think our screening of people’s nose with this test has been misunderstood.  This test was developed at CDC.  It’s a test that was developed specifically to identify people who are ill with novel coronavirus.  The issue is that we don’t know the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of that test when we’re using it in people who aren’t yet sick.  So, we’re looking in somebody’s nose to see if they have the novel coronavirus there.  But it’s possible, for example, that somebody already is asymptomatically incubating the disease.  We cannot, with the testing that we have now available at CDC, identify people in that phase, and I think that makes us concerned that this test, which is a point-in-time single test shouldn’t be relied upon to make a prediction at an individual level as to whether somebody’s going to ­– as to whether we can predict that person will become ill.  So that’s the answer to the first question.  The answer to the second question, in addition to the issue of these repatriated travelers, we have been with our State Health Departments very forthright and aggressive in identifying potential contacts around cases.  Using U.S. data, the thing that we are looking at most closely is if we can look at the contacts of confirmed cases and whether they’re spread around those contacts to help us better understand transmission dynamics.  But it’s going to be equally important, and we’re very excited that there’s going to be a team now going into China to look at their data,  because the data of the epicenter of disease is perhaps the best data right now that will help us know how to interpret this asymptomatic transmission.  We need to know if that – how that is impacting the drivers of the outbreak and what role that has in the community transmission in China.
Ben Haynes:  Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Stobbe with Associated Press.  Your line is now open.
Mike Stobbe:  Hi.  Thank you for taking my call.  I was wondering, somebody tried to leave March Air Force Base and then a county quarantine order was issued.  Has anyone else tried to leave since then?  Was that part of the decision making?  Also, are there any more flights that are going to be routed to air force bases moving forward?  Are you going to deal with every flight from now on going through a military facility and the people being quarantined in and I’m sure you all have extensive discussions about the pros and cons of quarantine, and can you talk about the cons, the things that made you hesitate to take this kind of action?  And finally, I’m sorry, could you tell us, is this novel coronavirus deadlier than seasonal flu?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Okay.  So that was four questions and that’s fine, but I’m going to take two of them and then Dr. Cetron is going to take two of them.  So, the question about the severity of disease, I guess is a good place to start.  And what I would say in terms of severity of disease is, the information that’s coming in from China suggests that there is significant mortality associated with this disease.  However, it is very difficult to use that information to calculate a case fatality ratio, and the case fatality ratio for flu differs year by year.  We also know that there are biases in reporting of diseases in general.  We have found that more severe disease tends to be reported first, which may throw off a calculation.  We also understand that the initial case definition in China really focused on patients with pneumonia.  And so, it’s not clear what the case fatality – the true case fatality ratio is right now.  Therefore, it’s difficult to compare the flu.  But what I would say is that there clearly are deaths being reported out of China, and that’s concerning.  I’ll answer also the question of future repatriation.  As I presume folks know, the State Department has already announced they will be repatriating additional travelers from Wuhan.  We are working closely with them to determine how those travelers will be – will be processed and what our operations will be when they’re back in the United States.  When we have that more finalized, we will definitely be providing that information, but we’re not prepared today to go in detail about how that operation will proceed.  Then for your other two questions, Dr. Cetron, do you want to handle this?
Dr. Marty Cetron:  Sure.  Thanks, Mike.  You asked about the use of this measure.  And, as Nancy said, we believe that this approach of having quarantine for the incubation period offers the greatest level of protection for the American public in preventing introduction and spread.  And that is our primary concern.  Prior epidemics actually suggest that people will be – when they’re properly informed, are usually very compliant with this request to restrict their movement.  There are benefits to the individual.  This allows someone who would become symptomatic to be rapidly identified.  And, you know, as these symptoms are not specific, there are many other things.  So, offering early rapid diagnosis of their illness could alleviate a lot of anxiety and uncertainty.  In addition, this is a protective effect on family members.  No individual wants to be the source of introducing or exposing a family member or a loved one to their virus.  And, additionally, this is a part of their civic responsibility to protect their communities.  Many of these people coming out have been diplomats that are serving America overseas.  So, they understand this.  In fact, when they arrived at Anchorage prior to getting to the base, they were exuberated and elated to be out of harm’s way, and the idea of the quarantine was not the thing that was troubling them.  So, I think that’s the example of why this is a good thing.  Clearly, there are cons.  If they’re not done properly, if it induces fear and stigma of individuals, if people aren’t treated with dignity and respect and have all the supportive care, that’s not the way to implement this tool in our toolkit, and we’re taking every measure possible to make sure that these people are treated with dignity and respect.  Oh, you asked if other people have tried to leave.  To our knowledge, when people express some concern, we do talk to them about these risk benefit issues, and they basically say, yeah, it sounds right.  This one person who tried to leave was, you know, offered a sort of a California quarantine order in order to enhance that level of protection.  But that is not the driving force of this decision.  So, this decision is made with deliberation about the nature of the epidemic and the virus, not about any one individual’s behavior.  Thanks.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stein with NPR.  Your line is now open.
Rob Stein: Thanks very much for taking my call.  My question is – a couple of questions.  If you can give us a little bit more detail about that one person, what exactly happened with them.  And the other question I had was you said this is the first time in 50 years that this quarantine order has been issued.  When was the last time and what were the details and circumstances of that?  And I just want you to clarify, I didn’t quite understand the question about other planes coming in.  Will the same thing happen with passengers on other planes coming in?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Again, we’re not going to provide more detail about this one individual.  That is something that we’re just not going to speak to more now.  In terms of the other planes, again, as we said, this situation continues to evolve, and our guidance, our operations, our implementation continues to evolve rapidly as we try to synthesize the risk.  We’ve made this decision.  We understand its historical significance.  We are working with the State Department to fully understand these other repatriated individuals.  And as we develop more concrete plans, you will certainly know them.  There are active conversations going on while we are at this teleconference on this issue, and when it’s worked out in more detail, we will be communicating that.
Dr. Marty Cetron:  In terms of the historical context, I think maybe it’s important for people to understand the difference between isolation and quarantine.  Isolation is a public health tool that’s used when we restrict the movement of someone who’s already sick with a specific illness.  Quarantine is basically when we have a recommended movement, restriction, or some kind of conditions on that movement for people who are exposed and not yet sick.  So, while there have been several isolation orders over the last many years, the last time the quarantine was used for a suspect case was in the 1960s for a smallpox evaluation.  So, I hope that helps.
Ben Haynes:  Next question, please?
Operator:  Our next question comes from Robert Langreth with Bloomberg News.  Your line is now open.
Robert Langreth:  Hi.  I just wanted to ask, so what happens to the remaining commercial flights coming from China?  What kind of screening and/or situation are you going to put on them?  Is that going to be enhanced?  Because I guess many of the flights are shutting down.  But there are still a bunch coming in, in the next few days.  And I think this virus is now in 50, 100 cities in China now.  What steps are you doing for the remaining commercial flights coming in, and are you enhancing that?
Dr. Marty Cetron:  At this point we’re evaluating the appropriate strategy in light of the new information.  There is nothing to share at this point.  And when there is something to share, we will.
Ben Haynes: We have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Then our last question comes from Lisa Krueger with San Jose Mercury News.
Lisa Krueger:  Thank you.  I wonder if you can clarify if all these passengers have been tested and those tests have come back negative, presumably?  And then a follow-up of how the quarantine is enforced.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  I’ll take the first question.  As we have tried to emphasize in my comments today, screening with a laboratory test in this setting does not help us identify people, clearly, who are going to be going on to illness.  That is, a negative result on a test will not help us confirm that people are safe from this disease.  No, all the test results are not back, and when we have them back, we will be communicating them first to the health care workers who are working with this community, 195 people.  But please remember that we do not believe that a negative result on this test means that somebody is out of danger for developing this disease, nor for communicating it to someone else.
Dr. Marty Cetron: With regard to your question about enforcement, the truth is, as I indicated before and prior experience in SARS, for example, in Toronto, in SARS over 99% of the persons, once educated and assured and reassured, didn’t need any legal enforcement.  So, while that may be available to the very few people when indicated, the best way to enforce a quarantine is to educate people on its purpose and educate what the benefits are for the individuals who cooperate.  These are American citizens who clearly want to do the right thing.  And in contrast to their experience in Wuhan, this is a much better scenario for them.  Thank you.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: And we should take the opportunity to thank them for their cooperation.  We understand that this is a difficult situation for them.  They’ve been through an ordeal.  And we’re asking them to take the time with us to make sure that they’re protecting their families and their communities, and we really admire their flexibility and resilience.
Ben Haynes:  Thank you, Dr. Messonnier.  And thank you, Dr. Cetron.  Thank you all for joining us for today’s update.  Please visit CDC’s 2019 novel coronavirus website for continued updates.  And if you have further questions, please contact the main media line at 404-639-3286 or email media@CDC.gov.  Thank you.

Hello and thank you all for joining us today for this briefing to update you on CDC’s COVID-19 response.  We’re joined by Dr. Nancy Messonnier who will give opening remarks before taking your questions.  At this time, I will turn the call over to the Dr. Messonnier.
Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us.  Over the weekend, multiple states announced new presumptive positive cases of COVID-19.  As of Monday evening, there were 60 cases that includes presumptive positives or CDC-confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 detected through the U.S. public health system.  This does not include people repatriated on U.S. State Department flights.  22 of the 60 cases are travel associated.  11 are likely person to person and 27 are under investigation, which means that state and local public health officials are still investigating how these people were infected.  Many states are now testing and reporting their own results.  While these results will be confirmed at CDC, the state and local health departments are taking public health actions based on these presumptive positives.  And CDC is counting these as cases.  We would be updating our online case count on weekdays by noon.  I just want to mention that we are no longer reporting the number of PUIs or patients under investigation nor those who have tested negative.  With more and more testing done at states, these numbers would not be representative of the testing being done nationally.  States are reporting results quickly and even — states are reporting results quickly and in the event of a discrepancy between CDC and state case counts, the state case counts should always be considered more up to date.  Developments since I last spoke to you have heightened our concern for certain communities in the U.S.  We have seen more reports come in from what is likely an outbreak in a long-term care facility in Washington state.  Sadly, now we have six deaths reported to CDC.  We have seen the first reports from Florida, Georgia, Rhode Island and New Hampshire state.  We expect to continue to find more cases.  These will probably result from a mixture of instances of travel-related, contact-related and community-associated cases where we don’t immediately know where people became exposed.  Right now, we have 12 states that have reported cases of COVID-19.  Many of these have occurred within the past 14 days.  Meaning that we may still find contacts of cases in those states who test positive for COVID-19.  The greatest risk of infection is among those who are in close contact with people who have COVID-19.  This includes family members and health care workers who care for people who are infected.  Right now, with still aggressive containment measures being taken to find and isolate cases in order to prevent spread, we want anyone with suspected exposure to someone with COVID-19 to reach out to their health care provider.  You should do that by phone.  There may come a day when we’re only looking for severe illness, but we’re trying to understand how the virus behaves and prevent additional spread.  I talked about risk of infection.  Now I would like to make a comment about the risk for serious outcomes.  While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, a report out of China suggest serious illness occurs in 16% of cases.  Older people and people with underlying health conditions, like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example, were about twice as likely to develop serious outcomes versus otherwise younger, healthier people.  We are particularly concerned about these people given the growing number of cases in the United States as well as those with suspected community spread.  What is happening now in the United States may be the beginning of what is happening abroad.  We will continue to maintain for as long as practical an aggressive national posture of containment.  That said, you might see some local communities taking specific actions to mitigate the disease.  It’s possible to contain the virus as well as work to mitigate future spread.  We ask for people’s patience and understanding and most importantly their cooperation.  If a health care provider or a public health worker tells you to stay home for 14 days unless you need medical care, please do that.  Right now, especially individual actions, can have an important impact on how this situation plays out.  You may need to take a break from your normal daily routine for two weeks.  We have seen this especially in patients from the Diamond Princess cruise ship where a significant number of people have had very mild illness and don’t feel particularly bad.  So staying home when you are sick is really important.  Don’t let the illness spread beyond you.  Stay away as much as you can from other people.  We have guidance on our website about how to minimize the risk to others in your household.  As more areas see community spread, local communities may start employing tools that encourage social distancing.  The goal of social distancing is to limit exposure by reducing face-to-face contact and preventing spread among people in community settings.  What these actions look like at the community level will vary depending on local conditions.  What is appropriate for one community seeing local transmission won’t necessarily be appropriate for a community where no local transmission has occurred.  People, communities, local and state governments should begin thinking about what this might look like for them and local action that might work best in their community to blunt the impact of this virus.  There are a spectrum of actions that can reduce spread and impact.  These are science-based and come from our play book on mitigating disease impact.  I want to stress the personal action that individuals can take.  Each year we recommend people wash their hands, cover their cough and sneezes and stay away from people who are sick.  This is the other side of not spreading the disease, which is not catching it.  Think twice before you expose yourself to someone who is showing symptoms.  This is especially important for people who are older and have underlying health conditions.  For seniors, preparedness may also mean making sure you have adequate supplies of routine medications, like medication for blood pressure and diabetes.  This is always part of what CDC recommends for preparedness.  If you’re 65 and older and particularly if you live in areas where there’s on going community spread, you need to think about what actions you can take to reduce your exposure.  CDC’s role is to provide technical advice to states and counties.  The decision of what steps to implement will be local.  It’s also very important that clinicians have the information they need to make the best decisions for their patients.  In addition to information on CDC’s website, we have open calls with clinicians.  The last call had more than 10,000 listeners.  We’re holding another call on Thursday.  You can find more information at emergency.CDC.gov.  I want to assure you that on other fronts partners in the U.S. Government and across the pharmaceutical industry are working quickly to develop effective tools to treat and prevent this virus, including anti-viral drugs and vaccines.  With the global increase in cases and the spread that is occurring here in the United States, there have been a lot of questions about what might happen to us.  I wish I could give you that answer.  Unfortunately, I cannot.  But I can assure you that CDC staff are working incredibly hard to assist the state and local health departments as they investigate and follow the new cases they have identified as well as provide guidance to all audiences on how to prepare.  I speak on behalf of all of our staff and staff all across the U.S. Government when I say, our hearts go out to the people who have been affected by this new virus both here and around the world.  We need to continue to work together within the federal government, across the public health infrastructure and in local communities.  All of us have a role to play in keeping ourselves, our families and our communities safe.  I would be happy to take some questions now.
We will now begin a question and answer question.  To ask a question from the phone lines please press star 1, enter your phone as unmute and record your name at the prompt.  Please keep your questions to one questions and one follow-up.  Our first question comes from Carolyn Johnson with the Washington Post.  Your line is open.
Thanks for taking my question.  There’s been a lot of criticism from epidemiologists about the narrow criteria for testing and how that might have been linked to the limited availability to test due to the problems with the test.  Can you just speak to that issue?  What was the cause of the limited criteria?  Do you now regret not expanding it earlier since the minute they start testing they’re finding cases?
Messonnier: CDC’s criteria for patients under investigation has always started with the importance of astute clinicians who are making judgments about what their patients are likely to have.  So we’ve always allowed those patients to be part of the testing criteria.  But what we really need to focus on now is where we are today.  There is spread across many countries across the world and spreading communities in the United States.  We need to be focused on what we’re doing today to identify patients who are ill, make sure that they’re getting appropriately treated and tested and make sure that we’re protecting our communities by keeping — by keeping yourselves and each other safe.
Next question, please.
Our next question comes from Craig Figner with CBS Los Angeles.  Your line is open.
Thank you. Dr. Messonnier, a couple of questions.  Here in California, do we have new information on testing kits, exactly how many have been shipped, will be shipped, when they will arrive?  And also, if you can give, are you able to speak freely?  Is anybody in the White House telling you to tamp down anything that you otherwise would like to say?
Messonnier: Yeah.  So the answer to the first question about California’s test kits is i really have to refer you to the state of California.  What i can say is over the weekend we shipped additional test kits to California.  And i understand from the FDA commissioner that by the end of the week they expect many more test kits to be available through other pathways besides CDC, which i know is great news for the clinicians out there.  In terms of my telebriefings, as many of you know, i have been doing these telebriefings regularly since the start of the outbreak.  I think we at CDC have been very open and able to answer lots of different questions, including those posed on these conferences.  Thank you.
Next question, please.
Our next question comes from Rebekah Lindstrom from 11 Alive.  Your line is open.
Thank you.  So, i’m trying to understand exactly how this process is going to be changing now that manufacturers are allowed to produce these test kits independently.  So, if I understand it correctly, the test kits were sent out to various states, to the public health department and then they were sending it back to the CDC for verification of the results.  Talk to me a little bit about now how that process is going to be working.
Messonnier: Sure.  Thanks for the opportunity to really clarify CDC’s role.  CDC’s role in this space is in getting a diagnostic quickly and correctly and then working with our public health laboratory partners and state and local health departments to make sure that the public health labs have early access to diagnostic capacity.  As part of that process, CDC has sent test kits out to states and those test kits are being used right now by many state health departments because of the FDA regulations, those are still considered presumptive positive until those are confirmed test at CDC, but those are actionable results that is state and local health departments are using those to make public health decisions.  That part is CDC’s role.  In order to get diagnostics to the front lines, that is, in the clinician’s hand at the bedside in the hospital, that’s really not the CDC public health test kit.  That’s the availability of test kits from commercial test manufacturers which is something that is overseen by FDA.  Again, based on the comments of the FDA commissioner over the weekend, I guess, last week, they are moving quickly to get those test kits out to commercial test manufacturers.  That means it will be a tool in the toolbox of clinicians in clinics and in hospitals that they can use based on clinical suspicion to test their patients.  That’s why it’s really important that clinicians look at the CDC guidance on our website, join our webinar so they can hear from us what information they need and also for clinicians to be in close touch with their own health departments so they can understand the local situation and how that might impact how they perceive and treat patients.  Next question.
Next question.
To make sure I’m understanding real quick, you’re saying that those tests then that might be in the clinics or at the bedside, would still be presumptive positive and then tests would still go back to the CDC for confirmation?
Messonier: Thanks for letting me clarify.  No, those kits — those test kits that are commercially manufactured are overseen by FDA, and they won’t have that same public health confirmatory process I was just talking about.
Our next question comes from Dennis Thompson with Health Day.  Your line is open.
Hi, Dr. Messonnier.  Thank you for taking my question.  Today in the MMWR there was report of patients with confirmed COVID-19 and in that it was noted that there was a second — a symptomatic secondary attack rate of about .45% among all close contacts and 10.5% among household members.  Should we read that as good news that this maybe isn’t as — as infectious to those around us as we would think?  Or how should we read those numbers coming out of CDC?
Messonnier: Yeah.  So thanks for bringing that up.  CDC did have an MMWR that came out today and I think it reflects the aggressive early stance of looking for contacts, aggressively around cases to see if we could find spread.  And among those early cases in the United States, we actually didn’t find a lot of spread in close contacts.  And I do think that’s good news.  But it is a relatively small number of cases compared to, for example, the 80,000 cases that are around the world.  So we take that as optimistic but we still need to be cautious with these early cases and do complete investigations which our state and local health departments are doing.  We are looking at the information both from the U.S. cases but certainly also from the information that’s coming in from other countries to try to understand the transmission dynamics and how it might impact the responses of state and local health departments.
Next question, please.
Our next question comes from Zara ? with Buzzfeed News.  Your line is open.
Hey, thanks so much for letting me ask a question.  I wanted to clarify on the testing, so I know there’s been numbers going around saying by the end of the week to be a million tests a day.  Is that exclusively based on the tests that CDC is sending out or is that accounting for the other tests that FDA is approving.  Similarly, can you clarify what the CDC will be posting now on in terms of case counts.  Thanks.
Messonnier: Yeah.  So thanks.  The number that you’re quoting is the number that the FDA commissioner has quoted as the commercially available kits.  So if there are questions about that i would definitely refer those to the FDA.  The CDC number is test kits that are going to public health labs.  And we expect that by the end of this week the public health labs will be able to test up to 75,000 people.  As you say, that will be a small part of the overall testing that will be available.  That’s why when I started my comments, I talked about the complications with expecting CDC’s case count to be up to date.  It’s a good thing that these tests are going to be widely available, but it also means that CDC will not always be up to the minute in terms of the latest number of cases, especially out of state local health departments.  So that’s why we say we really do need you to look to the states to those updated numbers.  CDC’s numbers may be a little more delayed because there are so much testing kits going out.
Next question, please.
Our next question comes from Lisa Krieger with San Jose Mercury News.  Your line is open.
Yes, thank you.  At the World Health Organization conference this morning there was concern of the global supply chain of PPEs and we heard from some hospitals Stanford and Harvard that they’re concerned about the stockpile.  Can you address that, please.
Messonnier: I can address part of it.  CDC’s role is working closely with our state and local health departments, including providing technical input to them.  And CDC’s part of this is in helping the state and local health departments with the variety of partners, including OSHA and NIOSH and health care association partners in thinking through how to make the best use of the supplies that we have.  In other words, our priority is making sure that the highest risk health care exposure is health care workers have appropriate PPE and looking at other ways in which other folks might be protected.  But the questions of our — the U.S. supply of PPE, those questions really need to go to the ASPR they have responsibility for the Strategic National Stockpile in the United States.
We have time for three more questions.  Next question, please.
Our next question comes from Sheila Kaplan.  Your line is open.
… what the contaminant was that was found in the test kits, please.
Sheila, we could not hear the first part of your question.  Please repeat.
Can you please tell us what the contaminant was that was found in the original CDC test kits?
Messonnier: So i think you’re talking about a report in AXIOS that attributed some issues with the CDC test kits to a contaminant.  What I can say about that is contamination is one possible explanation but there are others.  And I can’t really comment on what is an ongoing investigation.  Our focus is on moving forward.  That is on making sure that the test kits we are sending out now are well done and making sure that our state and local health department partners have access to the full resources of CDC to diagnose cases.
Next question, please.
Our next question comes from John Bonnefield with CNN.  Your line is open.
Hi.  Thank you for taking my question.  Can you explain to us why CDC isn’t somehow aggregating the testing that’s being done by public health labs to provide a national figure for the number of tests that are being conducted and on the number of PUIs?  Right now, what I’m inferring is there’s not going to be any kind of national figure and that’s very different than what we have been seeing from places like South Korea where they’ve been routinely updating on a national level?  Are you not asking public health labs to communicate this information to you or is there really no way for us to expect a national figure at all?
Messonnier: I’m sorry and I’m really glad you asked that question so I can correct that misunderstanding.  Of course we will be aggregating data on a daily basis and will have daily case counts up on our website.  What I meant to comment on is that sometimes our numbers come up on our website by noon but when there’s a case that’s reported from a state at 5:00, we don’t go back and reupdate our numbers.  It waits until the next day.  We update your numbers everyday.  We are certainly going to be aggregating national numbers.  We are certainly going to be providing a national and state specific picture of what’s going on, but sometimes you all in the media are covering individual cases that are being reported that aren’t on our counts yet because we’re, again, we’re updating them only once a day.  It’s just otherwise really difficult to continue to update the numbers when basically cases are getting confirmed and reported all night long.  So, definitely going to be providing national data and state level data.  But if you see, for example, a news report from the state that’s coming out in half an hour, we’re not going to go back and reupdate the numbers that came up on CDC’s website at noon.  Does that help?  Okay.  I’m hoping that helps.
Okay.  Last question, please.
Our final question comes from Mike Stobbe with the Associated Press.  Your line is open.
Hi.  Thank you for taking my call.  Many things I want to ask but I’ll just ask two.  In reference to your response to Sheila Kaplan’s question, I take it from your response that there’s an investigation going on and that you haven’t established what the problem was with the reagent in the kits.  Is that what you’re saying?  Or do you know what the problem was?  And the second question, if I may, as you know over the weekend researchers at Fred Huchinson Cancer Center in the University of Washington said they had done a study that had suggested that the virus was circulating for weeks in Washington and perhaps that was related to the lack of availability of tests or the testing criteria it suggests that the spread of the virus may have been worse because of some of the policies or availability of test kits that were in place based on federal decisions.  So, could you speak to that?  Thank you.
Messonnier: Sure.  So, in reference to the first question, you know, clearly it’s a priority at CDC and every level of our organization to make sure that our state and local health department, public health labs have access to the best tools possible.  And our focus right now is moving forward to make sure that the test kits that they’re getting from us meet the high quality standards that we and FDA hold ourselves to and we are very confident in the kits that are being sent out now.  There will be time in the future, I think, to look back and think about what we — what happened when, but our focus today is on — is how we’re moving forward.  The second question is, is a really intense question.  Researchers in Seattle were looking at the genetic sequencing of the strains that have been in Seattle and having an interesting hypothesis of how transmission might have worked.  What I would say is that it’s really interesting finding and interesting research.  There are alternate hypothesis for the same finding, for example, the sequences of the most recent strains coming out of Seattle actually also I understand match strains that were identified from later in the outbreak from China.  So I think this is another place where I’m happy to see so much research going on, but I still think that it’s in the hypothesis phase and we’ll need to wait for more data to come in to really fully understand how valid that hypothesis is and how to interpret it.  I’m really happy that researchers all around the country and all around the world are doing this kind of work because we’re clearly going to learn a lot from it.
Thank you.  And thank you all for joining us for today’s briefing.  Please check CDC’s COVID-19 website for the latest updates on CDC’s response efforts.  If you have further questions, please call the media line at 404-639-3286 or email media @CDC.gov.  Thank you.

This call is being recorded if you have objections, you can continue next disconnect at this time. You may begin.
Ben Haynes: Thank you, Sarah, and thank you for joining us for today regarding the CDC 2019 novel coronavirus response.  We are joined today by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease and health officials from the state of Washington.  Dr. Messonnier will provide opening remarks before taking your questions.  I will now turn the call over to Dr. Messonnier.
Nancy Messonnier: Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us.  During our briefing last Friday, I foreshadowed that we could see a novel coronavirus infection in the United States, most likely in a traveler from Wuhan. Today I am joined by representatives from the state of Washington to announce that we have now confirmed the first case of novel coronavirus in the United States.
CDC has been proactively preparing for an introduction of the virus here.  We know that today’s news is concerning.  I’m grateful with the work being done at all levels within the federal government and at the state and local level to prepare and respond.  Based on international reports, there are now close to 300 people who have been confirmed with this novel coronavirus in China, and there have been travel associated introductions in Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. Additional deaths have also been reported. Human to human spread has been confirmed.  How easily or sustainably this virus is spreading remains unknown. These new developments further emphasize CDC’s proactive approach in responding to this evolving outbreak.
In terms of our response: Over the weekend CDC finalized development of a real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction – abbreviated as rRT-PCR – test that can diagnose this new virus. We used this test to quickly confirm our first U.S. case.  Right now, testing for this virus must take place at CDC, but in the coming weeks, we anticipate sharing these tests with domestic and international partners through the agency’s International Reagent Resource. Yesterday, we activated our Emergency Operations Center in response to the newest developments.  I know a lot of you are likely wondering about the entry screening that we started on Friday at San Francisco airport, New York JFK, and LAX airport.  So far, CDC staff have screened over 1,200 passengers. However, no individuals have been referred to a hospital or discovered yet through entry screening.  This is an evolving situation and again, we do expect additional cases in the United States and globally. This week CDC will add entry health screening at two more airports – Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson and Chicago O’Hare.  Today, we will also be raising our travel health notice from a level 1 to a level 2. Preliminary information suggests that older adults with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe disease.
I’m now going to hand the briefing over to my colleague, Washington State Secretary of Health, John Wiesman, who will introduce key players in Washington state and outline what the public health system is doing in response to the case.  Dr. Wiesman.
John Wiesman: Great, thank you Dr. Messonnier.  I appreciate that.  Hello, I am John Wiesman, Secretary of Health for the state of Washington.  I first want to begin by recognizing the quick, collaborative work being done with our local and federal public health and healthcare partners. Over the holiday weekend, this group of people quickly identified a possible risk, coordinated the patient care, sent samples to CDC, and CDC tested them immediately.  Together we are implementing actions to ensure the public’s health is protected.  I am also thankful that the man who tested positive for this virus acted so quickly to seek treatment.  Because of that we were able to isolate him from the public. His actions gave us a head start. All of this work means we believe the risk to the public is low.  It’s true that we are learning more about the new coronavirus.  We have a strong public health team here in Snohomish county and Washington state.  And together with our partners at CDC, we will share any additional information as we learn it. To give you information about the situation, I’ll hand it over to our state infectious disease epidemiologist, Dr. Scott Lindquist and Dr. Chris Spitters, the health officer from Snohomish Health District, who will tell you more about the current situation. Dr. Lindquist.
Scott Lindquist: Thanks, this is Scott Lindquist, the state epidemiologist for Washington state. And just want to remind everyone how we had anticipated screening, so our system was ready despite a holiday weekend.  I’m thrilled to say we were able to detect this gentleman early.  This is a man in his  30s in a county north of Seattle, Snohomish county, and we have been in close contact, thanks to the CDC’s Emergency Operations Center helping direct the appropriate specimen collection, isolation, and investigation procedures with the local health jurisdiction. So, I’ll turn it over to our local health officer, Dr. Chris Spitters, who can give us some details of where they’re working on this patient right now.  Chris.
Chris Spitters: Thank you Scott. Last night, the Snohomish Health District coordinated with the Snohomish county emergency medical system to safely transport the patient to Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. That facility is following our jointly developed infectious disease protocols to ensure prevention of transmission in the facility. As stated earlier, the risk to the general public is low.  We are working with the medical center to ensure that the small number of healthcare workers and patients that may have been exposed are notified for symptom watch and monitored. No one wants to be the first in the nation in these types of situations, but these are the types of situations that public health and its partners train and prepare for. Because of this, everything has been going along quite smoothly and on behalf of the Snohomish Health District, I’d like to thank the Centers for Disease Control, the Washington State Department of Health, and Providence Regional Medical Center, as well as all of our local partners in Snohomish county for their support and collaboration in this effort.
Nancy Messonnier: Thank you all. I just wanted to add briefly that a CDC team has been deployed to support the ongoing investigation in the state of Washington, including tracing close contacts to determine if anyone else has become ill. As always, we stand by to help out state, local, and global partners in any way we can.  As I mentioned on Friday, we have faced similar challenges before – with SARS and MERS.  Those outbreaks were complex and required a comprehensive public health response. Because of that experience, we know it’s crucial to be proactive and prepared.  The confirmation that human to human spread with this virus is occurring in Asia certainly raises our level of concern about this virus, but we continue to believe the risk of this novel coronavirus to the American public at large remains low at this time.  Activation of the EOC and the enhanced airport entry screening reflect the continuation of CDC’s very aggressive public health response strategy. Enhanced airport screening is just one part of a layered approach to increasing the public health and healthcare delivery system to raising its awareness to properly detect the cases early.  This individual had a level of concern that enabled him to seek medical care promptly and his clinicians appropriately evaluated and reported the patient.  I want to remind everyone that we are still in the early days of this investigation – both domestically and abroad.  We are monitoring the situation closely and working to keep you informed every step of the way.  I want to take a moment to thank our colleagues in Washington at both the state and local level, as well as the healthcare staff that have been fully engaged and collaborating with us since yesterday when this case was discovered and tested as novel coronavirus.  Our ability to coordinate and react this quickly is entirely dependent on these collaborations.  We are aware that this situation could change quickly.  Therefore, we at CDC are taking a cautious approach to this outbreak and are prepared to respond to any new developments.
Ben Haynes: Thank you doctor, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: The first question is from Helen Branswell with STAT, your line is open.
Helen Branswell: Could we get something clear off the top.   This was supposed to be an embargoed press conference, but this news is out.  We can assume the embargo has lifted, yes?
Nancy Messonnier: I understand the answer to that is yes.
Helen Branswell: Thank you very much.   In this case with this individual, can you give us information about his condition?  Is he ill? Do you know if he had contact with people who were contagious?
Nancy Messonnier: Washington state we will let you answer that.
Chris Spitters: So, regarding the patient’s condition, they are in good condition and again, they’re currently hospitalized out of an abundance of precaution and for short term monitoring.  Not because there was severe illness.  At this point, the individual has reported that he did not visit any of those implicated markets and did not know anyone who was ill.  He was just traveling from that area.
Ben Haynes: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you, our next question from Evan Brown with Fox News, your line is open.
Evan Brown: Thank you very much. Just thinking back a number of years to the Ebola incident in Dallas. We saw a real push to not only have that individual placed in isolation as well as the other folks who became ill with very strict isolated standards. Is this a scenario where this same contingency is needed? Or no? What type of care is given to the patient for this? Are they isolating him and what type of medications can he get? Or, is it a matter of supportive care?
Nancy Messonnier:  This is CDC, maybe we’ll give a general answer and then we’ll turn it over to Washington for you all to talk specifically about this patient.  Thank you for that question.  It’s actually important to clarify that the precautions for this patient are standard isolation precautions.  This is something many hospitals know how to do and we’re grateful that in this region in Washington state they were quite prepared for this contingency.  So this is not a situation like the Dallas one.  This is something where most hospitals in the region should have a hospital that can utilize these kinds of precautions. Washington?
This is CDC, maybe I’ll also say this is a hugely important issue and the health of our healthcare workers is very important to all of us.  And we are practicing very, we are being proactive at all levels to make sure that as much as possible the people taking care of this patient are careful and cautious. And CDC will be working closely with the state health department on the particulars of this patient’s care.
Scott Lindquist: Just regarding the Dallas or the Texas incident, this is again, not the same situation and plus this is an area of the state that has drilled recently on transporting a person in the ambulance and what types of isolation they should require.  And there’s no question that there is isolation equipment available to the hospital. Again, we are very comfortable that this patient is isolated, poses a very little risk to the staff or the general public in this current situation. And again, because of an abundance of caution, we have used pretty strict isolation requirements and hospitalization because it is the first person in the United States. We will likely learn from this and future cases and we will adjust our recommendations accordingly.
Ben Haynes: The next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lena Sun with the Washington Post.
Lena Sun: Hi, can someone go over the basics with us. When did this person arrive? Did they arrive through one of the airport screening locations? Were they on a direct flight from Wuhan? What was the timeframe? Is this person a resident of the United States he went to China for business or pleasure and is now back in the United States?
Scott Lindquist:  We can give you the detail we know and that’s our priority today is really all the details of flight numbers, seat numbers, and people that would have been exposed. What we know currently is he proceeded the institution of the screening at the airports. He came in before that screening was done and was actually not with symptoms when he came to the United States. But this was a very astute gentleman that is looking at internet activity and had actually researched this and shared this information with his provider. We know it was not a direct flight from Wuhan to Sea-Tac, which is our local airport.  And that’s really our challenge coming forward.  We had talked about this on Friday that while we weren’t screening at Sea-Tac, we potentially could have a traveler that came through many routes. So we decided to activate and be ready before all the screening airports were set into motion.  So, this gentleman kind of preceded and slipped around that type of screening, but because the public health system was aware and because this is a really agreeable gentleman who was looking out for his health care, we were able to detect it early and really minimize ongoing exposure to anybody.
Lena Sun: So I have a follow-up question that I want to understand. So, this gentleman came to Seattle and you’re not sure how. It was not a direct flight and because he was monitoring the internet and did not have symptoms, when he started to get symptoms, he proactively reached out to providers or health officials?
Scott Lindquist:  Correct, that’s exactly how he did it.   Chris, is there anything you would like to add?
Chris Spitters:  Just to add on that he has been fully cooperative.
Lena Sun: Okay, is he a resident of the United States?
Chris Spitters:  Yes, a resident of the U.S.
Nancy Messonnier: Before we move on, I just want to say that as this situation and as the information has been accumulating over the weekend, CDC has been thinking and rethinking our stance and we made some decisions on Sunday even in advance of this case.  And Dr. Marty Cetron, who many of you know, is just going to tell us where we are on that screening.
Marty Cetron:  First I want to highlight the fact that, leave not doubt, entry screening is just one part of a multilayered system. The point is to alert the system.  Individuals are often very empowered to make good decisions if they are informed.  Healthcare systems and public health departments, as you just heard, are being alerted.  The entry screening is one part of that with notices going out.  The screening system started after the Seattle case, this gentleman was indirect, not through a direct flight.  Over the weekend with the increasing cases, we decided to move into this full on 100% coverage strategy which means adding additional airports and instructing on Sunday the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation to begin our funneling approach and redirect all the traffic to the airports that have screening so the benefit of the alert can be more completely covered.  So that plan is in place, the new airports will be rolling online this week and the operationalizing of the funneling, which is a very complex process involves reissuing tickets and rerouting passengers from all over the globe through connecting and direct flights.  All of that is part of the strategy that was acutally initiated before we even heard about this case to compete that coverage.
Lena Sun: I have another follow-up question. The reporter would like to know the date of when this gentleman came to Seattle?
Marty Cetron:  Our best understanding is on the 15th of January. The screening initiated on the 17th.
Lena Sun:  When did he reach out to providers?
Scott Lindquist:  Yeah, he actually reached out on the 16th.  This is Scott Lindquist.  He actually reached out to his medical provider on the 19th.  We were in communication with the CDC Emergency Operations Center coordinating specimens that were shipped overnight and had the results the following day, incredibly fast.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from USA Today. Your line is open.
Grace Hauch: Hi there. I wonder if this gentleman came through Sea-Tac why there is an screening there and at Chicago, has screening begun or is it about to begin? Are there other airports considering?
Marty Cetron:  Yeah, no, the kind of active screen isn’t in place at Sea-Tac and as I indicated last Friday, when we spoke, you have to go down to a lot of airports to do this across the country, for every single possible flight. So, we concentrate that by volume and when we get to the top five as we are looking at here in this regard, that we begin to redistribute the flights so they can be concentrated in the airports. However, all 14 airports that had passengers had notices and had been put on alert, had been working from the airport quarantine stations with their public health partners. So, again, it’s a multistep process.  It rolls out and, in fact, this idea of funneling means redirecting and reissuing tickets so all the arriving passengers from Wuhan would come in to the airports where we can surge this capacity at.  All the airports are doing other steps, particularly passenger education, as which you can see if very important in this regard.  And that education is in both English and Mandarin.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: The next question from Ryan with the Seattle Times, your line is open.
Ryan Blethen: Hi, I wasn’t let onto the phone call until the question- and-answer period and I may be asking about things already covered. Where in Washington state is this man? You can start with that.
I am curious as to where he is in Washington in which hospital he is at? And what are hospitals doing in Washington now to look for this? Also, on the screening question, is Sea-Tac going to be one of the airports that will be screening for this now?
Chris Spitters: So the gentleman is a Snohomish county resident and he is currently at Providence Medical Center.  This is Chris, I am the health officer for the Snohomish Health District.
Marty Cetron:  I think it’s important to point out that all the quarantine stations do enhanced education and respond to any illness report. I indicated that active screening, which is where every passenger is questioned and has a temperature check is going on at the top three airports right now – JFK, San Francisco which has direct flights and LAX which has most of the indirect flights. Additional screening will be added to Chicago and Atlanta this week and rolled out as soon as the capacity.  And the rest of the airports, all of the people who originate in Wuhan and travel into the United States, all of those tickets, passengers will be rerouted into these five.
Scott Lindquist:  And this is Scott Lindquist, the state epidemiologist for Washington state. This is part of our larger plan of preparing the hospitals and the healthcare system for all hazard preparedness which means Ebola, SARS, MERS, or in this case, the novel coronavirus. Most of these hospitals have been prepared with infection control with how to sample, how to isolate.  And we were well prepared as this hospital is one of the hospitals that recently did a drill as well as our ambulance system for transporting this patients.
John Wiesman:  And just sort of reinforcing the layered approach here, hospitals need to be prepared with patient education.  In this case we don’t believe even if we had active screening at the airport that this patient would have been picked because at the time, we don’t believe the patient had symptoms or a fever.  So, this is the important piece about having a strong public health system all across this country that is prepared for this kind of biosecurity approach.
Ben Haynes: Two more questions.   Our next question comes from Roni Rabin with the New York Times.
Roni Rabin: I also came in very late and right now what is being done to secure or what steps is the CDC doing about that?   You have people in China who are working with the Chinese authority.
Nancy Messonnier:  This is CDC.  As you say, there is new information hour by hour, day by day that we are tracking and following closely.  We do have staff in China and Thailand and they have long term placements there working closely with the ministries of health.  We also have staff at WHO and certainly have collaborated with global health leaders worldwide.  We and the global health community are really working together to understand the situation. Information is rapidly evolving and we hope that over the next coming days, the situation will become clearer and certainly as you point out, the key issue that we all need to understand is how easily or sustainably the virus is spread form human to human and that is information we don’t completely have nailed down yet.  But we’re continuing to work globally with all our partners to better understand it.
Roni Rabin: Thank you. Can you still hear me? In the case of the Washington patient –?   Just a reminder of the timeline.
Scott Lindquist:  Just a reminder of the timeline.  This gentleman presented on Sunday, specimens were obtained, and the results were learned on Monday.  And today, Tuesday, our priority is doing contact investigation and tracing. So, we have had three people assigned to us from CDC that are here and that is our priority to determine what it means to be at risk, who those people are, doing the contact investigations all the way from China to his home here in Snohomish county. That’s exactly what our priority is right now early in this investigation.
Nancy Messonnier:  Just to add that we are grateful that the patient is doing well and that is clinically not ill and he has been so cooperative.  Things have been moving quickly and the health department has appropriately been prioritizing their activities.  But there will be a whole set of activities to come in the coming days.  But their first priority was clearly making sure this patient was healthy and being appropriately treated as we move on to the next phase.
Ben Haynes: Last question.
Operator: The last question comes from Julie Steenhuysen with Reuters, your line is open.
Julie Steenhuysen:  Are you coordinating with the world health organization in terms of how to treat this patient? What are you using at this point?
Nancy Messonnier:  There is a global effort to share information about potential treatments.  That’s globally among the community of people that have dealt with similar issues with MERS and SARS, as well as inter-governmentally within the United States. So all those conversations are ongoing and very active. That being said, as our collaborators in Washington state said, the gentleman is right now very healthy.  I think that it would be characterized that he is getting supportive care and monitoring.
Chris Spitters:  That’s absolutely correct, I have nothing to add.
Julie Steenhuysen:  One more follow-up, is CDC working with NIH to develop a vaccine and where is that effort?
Nancy Messonnier: NIH has always been very active in this area and there is early work early and early conversations. As you know, the development of a vaccine is a complex process.  It’s not something that’s going to be available tomorrow.  But there are active conversations about vaccines as well as diagnostics [editor’s note: therapeutics should replace diagnostics].

Paul Fulton: Thank you all for joining us today for a briefing on CDC’s 2019 novel coronavirus response.  We’re joined today by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease.  Dr. Messonnier will make opening remarks before we take questions. I will now turn the call over to Dr. Messonnier.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Good morning and thank you for joining us.  I’m joined by Dr. Weldon who is leading our task force for this response. To date we have 110 of what we’re calling persons under investigation or PUIs from 26 states.  This is a cumulative number and will only increase.  We still only have five confirmed positives and 32 that have tested negative.  There have been no new confirmed cases overnight. This information will be posted on our website and updated on our website on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  I want to give a short update of the laboratory side of our work.  Last week we mentioned CDC has developed a diagnostic test called a real-time reverse transcription preliminary chain reaction, that’s RRTPCR.  It can diagnose this new coronavirus in respiratory serum samples from clinical specimens.  Last Friday we publicly posted the protocol for this test.  This is a blueprint to make the test.  Currently we’re refining this use of this test so we can provide optimal guidance to states and laboratories on how to use it.  We’re working on a plan now so that priority states get these kits as soon as possible.  But in the coming weeks we’ll share these tests with domestic and international partners so they can test for the virus themselves.  Our longer-term plan is to share these tests with domestic and international partners through the agency’s international re-agent resource.  Additionally, CDC uploaded the entire genome from the virus from the first and now second cases reported in the united states.  All the sequences we extracted are similar the one that china initially posted a couple of weeks ago.  This means that right now and based on CDC’s analysis of the available data it doesn’t look like the virus has mutated.  And we’re growing the virus in cell culture which is necessary for further studies, including the additional genetic characterization.  Once isolated the virus will be available in the bei resources repository, which is a NIH resource that supplies organisms and re-agents to the broad community or microbiology and infectious disease researchers.  As we have said since the beginning, this is a rapidly changing situation, both here and abroad.  16 international locations including the U.S. have identified cases of this new virus.  I’m sure you’ve seen the reporting and videos coming out of china in Wuhan, particularly.  Our thoughts are with the people on the front lines of this emerging public health threat in china.  Right now, we are continuing to screen a few passengers from Wuhan at the five designated airports.  This enhanced entry screening serves two purposes.  The first is to detect illness and rapidly respond to symptomatic people entering the country.  The second purpose is critical to educate travelers about these symptoms of the virus and what to do if they develop symptoms.  I expect our travel recommendations will change in the coming days.  I can’t provide details on this yet but know we’re working on it.  Given the aggressive public health response we’re pursuing, there may be some disruptions experienced by some.  CDC recommends travelers avoid all non-essential travel to Hubei province china. Yesterday we began recommending people traveling to all parts of china practice enhanced precautions including avoiding contact with people who are sick and discussing travel to china with your healthcare provider, especially if you are an older adult or have underlying health conditions.  Returning travelers with symptoms and close contact of people confirmed with novel coronavirus may be asked to take precautionary measures.  We understand many people in the united states are worried about this virus and how it will affect Americans.  Risk depends on exposure.  Right now, we have a handful of patients with this new virus here in the united states.  However, currently in the U.S., this virus is not spreading in the community.  For that reason, we continue to believe that the immediate health risk from the new virus to the general American public is low currently.  Every day we learn more and every day we assess to see if our guidance or our response can be improved.  As this response evolves CDC will continue our aggressive public health response strategy, working to protect the health and safety of the American public.  Thank you.
Paul Fulton: Thank you, Dr. Messonnier. We’re now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you.  As a reminder if you want to ask a question please press star one, unmute your phone and record your name clearly when prompted.  One moment, please.  Once again to ask a question press star one. Our first question is from Michele Cortez from Bloomberg, news.
Michele Cortez: Hi.  Thanks, so much for taking the question.  I wonder if you can give us some details on the screening, the flight screening now that we’re not having flights out of Wuhan directly any longer if you can tell how many patients were screened or how many travelers were screened and if there were any detected that way, how many we are following with close contacts and how you think that’s going to change?  I you know mentioned that in passing but I’m wondering if you’ll expand it to all of china or shut it down.  What are your thoughts on that?  Thanks.
Dr. Messonnier: Sure.  We’ve screened somewhere around 2400 people so far.  And as you imagine, the number of people who are coming from Wuhan is declining with the aggressive closure of that city.  I don’t have in front of me sort of daily total from today or even the day before, but those numbers are, indeed, declining and we’re continuing the same posture with those five airports with the same screenings.  Two reasons to do the screening, one is to identify ill returning passengers so that they can be identified quickly, treated promptly, and so that we can keep transmission from going further and importantly education so that we can educate returning travelers about the signs and symptoms.  In terms of people identified through screening there’s a variety of people that are being tracked and I don’t think I’ll go in more detail.  In terms of our forward-looking stance, as I said this outbreak is unfolding rapidly and we’re rapidly looking at how we should — how it impacts our posture at the border.  We’re certainly considering broadening of that screening and that is something that I’ll be prepared to speak about as soon as we can decide on it.
Paul Fulton: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you.  Our next question is from dan Vergano from BuzzFeed news.
Dan Vergano:  Hi, thanks very much.  I wonder if you could say something about the disputes over the weekend about the infectiousness of the disease, the subzero factor.  Is there any way this usually plays out or there a stage at which you can definitively say how infectious this disease is?
Dr. Messonnier: I wouldn’t say it’s a dispute.  I would say its scientists from around the world are looking at the available data and trying to analyze it, to come up with information that will be helpful in response.  So, different scientists are looking at the data slightly differently and our general interpretation at this point is that the incubation period is somewhere around two to 14 days.  I do think, again, it’s important that this outbreak is really unrolling in front of our eyes and when will we have a definitive answer it may not be further on into an outbreak.  There’s some confusion about what this is that folks are talking about, it’s called an Arnot. It’s a reproductive number of how many infected people come from a single infected person.  Several different groups looked at it. Most articles have had interpretation that the Arnot is somewhere 1.5 and 3.  That’s not a dramatic difference. As a comparison, the Arnot for measles is somewhere around 12 to 18.  That’s among the most contagious.  In general, you want to get an Arnot below one.  That’s how you get the disease controlled.  I’ll stop there.
Paul Fulton: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you.  Our next question is from Evan Brown from fox news.
Evan Brown: Hi, good morning.  Could you talk a little bit more about the posting of the protocols for this test?  Is this now sort of like an open source kind of test?  Are your encouraging as many different health departments around the world to do this, to be able to have their own version of this test or am I not getting that right.  Can you explain that more and tell me the best you can how helpful you think it would be to get this test out there as quickly as possible to as many different agencies?
Dr Messonnier: I’ll start.  I think — thank you for allowing us to clarify.  We have put that protocol out.  It’s a blueprint, Dr. Weldon will explain more about what that means.  In general, at this stage of the investigation we are asking our clinical lab partners to send samples to CDC because we think that’s the most efficient way to — in order to ensure results are as accurate as possible.  I would point out that other countries as far as I know every other country is doing centralized testing.  That is sort of how we typically stand up in this kind of response.  Our most important priority is making sure that the tests is accurate.  Speed is important but accuracy is probably a priority.  Dr. Weldon, do you want to talk more about this?
Dr. Weldon: Yes.  So, the protocol that was posted online, the intent was to use this as a blueprint.  The hope is researchers can take this protocol and adapt it in their own labs so they can have this important tool available at their disposal for testing samples from suspected patients.  The protocol itself is undergoing rigorous evaluation in our own labs and kits are being developed that will allow CDC to distribute to state and international labs so that they will have the important re-agency needed for the assay.
Paul Fulton: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you.  Our next question is from Kat Eschner from popular science.
Kat Eschner: Thank you for taking my question.  I’m wondering if you can speak to the origins of the virus at all. Two articles suggest it may not have come from the Wuhan seafood market.  Do we know anything more at this time?
Dr. Messonnier: So, I would also put this in the range of interesting science that’s coming out rapidly and at CDC we’re work to synthesize it.  There are two different kinds of research that’s coming up in these articles.  Some of it is genetic sequencing analysis which is comparison of the sequencing of the strains from china with other coronaviruses including animal coronavirus and SARS and MERS.  There is epidemiology data in terms of the genetic sequencing data it looks somewhat like a bat coronavirus, but I think there’s a lot more to be done in term of both the genetic sequencing as well as the analysis into the epidemiological research before we are all confident that we know how this started.  Yesterday the microphone may not have been on when I answered a question, so I’ll make sure I re-answer that.  There was a question about the risk of novel coronavirus from packages of products shipped from china.  So, there’s still a lot unknown about the newly emerged 2019 coronavirus and how it spread.  But we know a lot about MERS and SARS, the other two coronavirus that are known to be infectious in people.  The Novel coronavirus is genetically related more to SARS than MERS, which also have their origins in bats.  We don’t know for sure if this virus will behave in the same way as far as MERS, we use information from those coronaviruses to guide us.  In general, because of the poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, that’s in the range of hours, there’s likely a very, very, very low if any risk of spread from products or packaging that is shipped over a period of days or weeks in ambient the temperatures.  So, at this time we can’t fully evaluate the risks from different products that are shipped from china under different conditions, but coronaviruses have generally spread most often by respiratory droplets and there’s no evidence that supports transmission of this coronavirus is associated with imported goods and no cases in the U.S., associated with imported goods.  More information will be posted as it becomes available on our website and I’m sure we’ll talk about it in upcoming media teleconferences.
Paul Fulton: Thank you.  Next question?
Operator: Thank you.  Our next question is from Dawn Kopecki from CNBC.
Dawn Kopecki: Hi.  Last week you said that there was no evidence that the coronavirus was infectious during the incubation period but china’s health minister this weekend said that there was evidence that it could be spread when people were asymptomatic. Do you have any additional information on this?
Dr. Messonnier: We have seen the reports out of china regarding the spread of the disease.  We at CDC don’t have any clear evidence of patients being infectious before symptom on sets.  However, with our states and local health department partners we are being very aggressive and very cautious in tracking of close contacts to determine if we can identify any close contacts who are, indeed ill.  So far, we’ve not seen any human-to-human transmission in the United States, but we’ll update you as more information becomes available from the U.S., as well as other countries.
Dawn Kopecki: Thank you.
Paul Fulton: Our next question, please?
Operator: Thank you.  Our next question is from Melissa Jenco from AAP News.
Melissa Jenco: Yes, thanks for taking my question.  I just wondered if you could tell us if this virus has had — what kind of impact this had on children both in the U.S., and what you know of the global cases?
Dr Messonnier: So far most of the information coming out from China which is certainly where most cases are is that the disease is by far majorly in adults with older adults in those underlying illnesses with higher risk.  In the united states the five cases are all in adults.  There are a few reports of disease in children, and we’ll wait to learn more as more information becomes available.  In the U.S., as you can imagine we’re also taking a cautious approach and certainly we’ll be very cautious about making sure that if there are children who are immunized and treated properly and monitoring any close contacts of cases that happen to be children.
Paul Fulton: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you.  Our next question is from Mike Stobbe from the associated press.
Mike Stobbe: Hi.  Thank you for taking my question.  Doctor, could you say more — you said there were 110 people in the U.S., are being monitored.  The samples have been taken from each of them and you’re awaiting results.  Could you be more specific about what is going on the evaluation of those 110 people?  Can you say when the test kits are expected to be sent out.  I’m sorry, you kind of alluded to a decision that I guess CDC is discussing about whether to change its travel recommendation.  Anything else you can say or are you thinking of doing screening for all Chinese passengers?  You dangled something big in front of us and we’re all kind of wondering what you’re referring to.  Thank you.
Dr. Messonnier: Sure.  So, let me take those in order.  In terms of the PUIs, the process is like this.  We identify somebody who potentially has exposure to Wuhan and has a fever and a respiratory illness.  We would consider a PUI to be somebody who had contact with a confirmed case and had fever and respiratory illnesses. Those patients are coming to attention in a variety of formats.  Some have presented themselves to a health care provider.  Others are being detected through vigilance at health departments, the airport and healthcare providers, so when those patients are identified that procedure is set that the health department gets called first.  The health department calls CDC.  We have folks here on site 24/7 through our emergency operation center.  The CDC people who take the call discuss the case with the health department and clinician and based on the discussion decide whether that patient merits additional laboratory diagnostics.  Specimens are taken and they are sent to CDC where they are tested.  The time lag between a patient — the decision that a patient needs further laboratory testing and a result is somewhere around a day, depending on where that patient is being seen and how we can most efficiently ship it.  That number of PUIs is that general number and as you say, we’ll be working our way through the ones that will require additional laboratory testing and you’ll see patients identified as either being confirmed cases or hopefully rule out as a confirmed case.  In term of the lab kits what I would say is we’re working as fast as we can, and I am going to say one to two weeks.  We’re doing everything we can to make it as fast as possible.  We understand that for physicians, clinicians and health departments it’s important to have the kits as close as possible to the patients geographically so we can provide a result but it’s another week or two.  In terms of the last thing we are intermittently thinking about this decision.  As you know there’s lots of new information coming out of china in terms of cases, in terms of what is going on there outside of Wuhan.  There are other provinces.  The case numbers.  We’re trying to take that into account as we move quickly as we can towards any decisions.  I expect that there will be a decision and announcement about that within the next day, but I can’t give you a time because we want to make sure that we’re being expedient and sensible about what kind of decisions and recommendations we’re making.
Paul Fulton: I think we have time for two more questions.  Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Lisa Irizarry from news day.
Lisa Irizarry: Hi, thanks for taking my question.  I just want to make sure I understood, 110 persons under investigation, they were either themselves traveling in china in Wuhan or they had contact with somebody who had recently traveled, is that correct?
 
Dr. Messonnier: Generally, most of them, yes.  As I said before we have a general guideline.  However, because there is so much unknown, we are being cautious about testing and being responsive to concerns of the clinicians and the health department.  The decision about whether that patient gets tested is a joint decision between the clinician, the health department and CDC.  So, in general that is the correct definition, but around the edges there may be some additional testing and know that this issue also, what we consider a PUI is something that we’re in active discussions out with our state and local partners.  In the definition of the PUI also know that while that number is 110 — we’re prioritizing based on PUIs that might be at higher risk.  For example, in general somebody who has a very close contact of a confirmed case and has respiratory symptoms might be a high are priority than somebody with a mild cough and traveled to Wuhan two weeks ago.  Those are not real examples but just know that within that 110 we also are prioritizing based on risk.
Lisa Irizarry: One quick follow up question, it’s 26 states.  At some point will you release which states those are?
Dr. Messonnier: As you know, we are incredibly sensitive about releasing names of states in this kind of context.  So that would really be up to a state health department whether they want to make that release.  What I would say is if you want to know whether there are any PUIs in your state, please contact the state health department and let them make the decision about whether they want to release that number or not.
Lisa Irizarry: Thank you very much.
Paul Fulton: Last question please.
Operator: Our final question today is from Ronnie Koenig from the “New York Times”.
Ronnie Koenig: A couple of things.  I want to get more clarity on this the flight from Wuhan.  I didn’t think there were flight from Wuhan.  Your screening people who came from another city via Wuhan and are you able to get that information or do they present themselves at the airport?  I’m not sure how that’s happening unless there are flights coming.  I just want to ask one more thing.  Your asking people to present themselves to come in for testing if they have been to Wuhan?  I mean 110 out of — I mean we know there are so many people who have traveled recently from china.  That is a very small number and we do see they are asymptomatic and not older with under lying conditions.  So just a little confused about — are you — is there scarcity of testing?
Dr. Messonnier: There’s no scarcity of testing and I’m sorry if you could let me respond now.
Ronnie Koenig: Sure.
Dr. Messonnier: Thanks.  So, again, as I said, flights from Wuhan, direct flights have certainly been stopped.  But there are a variety of people who are called broken itineraries, they may be transiting from Wuhan through another country back to the united states.  There are still individuals who are in the middle of one of those itineraries when I am talking about screening passengers from Wuhan, I’m talking about those people. As I said earlier, I don’t have numbers from the past day, but we are gathering those people and they are still part of the same screening.  In terms of the message to travelers, our focus is on returning travelers from Wuhan who have respiratory symptoms and fever.  This is something that we’ve been trying to make sure, we’re being very clear about to returning travelers and one of the things that’s really important about the screening at the airport is that we’re not just identifying people who are sick, we’re passing out those messages so that people who returned from Wuhan who came back a week ago, for example, if they have today a fever and respiratory infections, my message to them is please call your health care provider.  It’s important you get analyzed and you may need to be tested.  As many of you know several of the confirmed patients in the united states were asymptomatic when they came back.  Developed symptoms later.  I want to compliment them because they were prompt in calling their health care provider and identified themselves as traveling to Wuhan.  Patients who are returning are an important part of this equation and I’m sorry I misspoke, travelers from Hubei not just from Wuhan.  If you recently returned from Hubei and you have a fever and respiratory symptoms, please call your health care provider so you can be appropriately checked out and we want to make sure you get the best care possible.
Paul Fulton: Thank you, Dr. Messonnier.  Thank you all for joining us today for this briefing.  Please remember to visit the 2019 Novel Coronavirus webpage for continued updates.  If you have further questions, please call the CDC media line at 404-639-3286 or email media @cdc.gov.

At this time, I would like to inform all participants that your lines have been placed on a listen only mode until the question and answer session of today’s call. Today’s call is also being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Benjamin Haynes. Sir, you may begin.
Benjamin Haynes: Thank you Sue. And thank you all for joining us for today’s briefing to update you on CDC’s 2019 novel coronavirus response. We are joined today by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who will give open remarks before taking your questions. I will now like to turn the call over to Dr. Messonnier.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Thank you for joining us.   Today, I would like to provide a few updates on important developments over the last few days. First, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the American who died in China over the weekend. As far as we know, this is the first American to die from this new coronavirus.  Though more than a thousand people in China have died. My sympathy and my thanks go to the people of China, for those who have lost loved ones and those who are on the front lines battling this virus. In China, they are taking aggressive measures just as we are in the United States. Since we briefed you last, there has been one new confirmed novel coronavirus infection detected in the United States. The new confirmed infection is an individual who returned from Wuhan and was quarantined at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.  This individual was on one of the last Department of State flights out of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak in China.  Given the spread of the virus in Wuhan, it is not surprising to see a positive case among people who recently returned from there.  That is in fact the reason they are being quarantined.  Currently the person has mild illness but is hospitalized.  This brings the total number of confirmed positives in the United States to 13.  I want to clarify some of the reports that have been circulating about this case.  Last Thursday when one of the planes from Wuhan landed at Miramar, a few people were sick and transported to local hospitals for further evaluation.  These people were placed in isolation and samples were taken for testing.  When running laboratory diagnostics for any disease, anywhere in the world, the ability to match the individual to the specimen is key, and is part of the normal procedures put in place to ensure that that matching is done correctly.  But in this situation with this patient, it didn’t work correctly, and the patient was misidentified initially as negative.  The issue was identified within 24 hours.  The CDC tested the sample, the positive result was conveyed quickly to the local public health and CDC teams.  The mishap was unfortunate, but we have corrected this from happening again in the future by adding additional quality control.  And it’s really important to emphasize that during this time appropriate infection control precautions were taken around everyone, including around this patient who, again, is doing well.  Now I’d also like to update you on our diagnostic test kits.  As you know, this is a dynamic, rapidly evolving situation, and our response continues to be based on the latest science.  We continue to be flexible to meet the public health challenges that the virus presents, and clearly a success is the CDC rapid development of a diagnostic and rapid deployments to the states, which was clearly important to try to bring the testing closer to patients to avoid delays that have been inherent in sending samples to CDC.  When the state receives these test kits, their procedure is to do quality control themselves in their own laboratories.  Again, that is part of the normal procedures, but in doing it, some of the states identified some inconclusive laboratory results.  We are working closely with them to correct the issues and as we’ve said all along, speed is important, but equally or more important in this situation is making sure that the laboratory results are correct.  During a response like this, we know things may not always go as smoothly as we would like.  We have multiple levels of quality control to detect issues just like this one.  We’re looking into all of these issues to understand what went wrong, and to prevent these same things from happening in the future.  Before I take questions, I want to give you a couple more updates.  Since the airport screening began in mid-January, CDC and its partners have screened more than 30,000 passengers from China.  With the temporary restrictions on travel, we are seeing fewer and fewer travelers from China, especially from Hubei province.  Passengers are being funneled through 11 airports, most of these people are coming from parts of mainland China outside of Hubei, show no symptoms and have not been assessed as high risk.  Those who passed the screening continue on to their final destination where they self-monitor their health for 14 days in cooperation with their state and local health departments.  We’re asking these people to limit their activities and stay home during that 14-day period.  Our goal is to be as least restrictive as possible while ensuring the safety and health of all Americans.  Since starting our travel restrictions and funneling through airports, we have not detected any cases among returning travelers from China.  Most of the U.S. cases were found before the travel restrictions were put in place among travelers who returned from Wuhan and later sought medical care for their illnesses.  These cases were picked up by astute clinicians and reported to CDC.  We are continually reassessing our recommendations around quarantine and self-monitoring and will continue to work with state and local public health departments to refine and improve this process. Most of the diseases in China, however, we can and should be prepared for this new virus to gain a foothold in the U.S.  The goal of the measures we have taken to date are to slow the introduction and impact of this disease in the United States but at some point, we are likely to see community spread in the U.S.  Or other countries and this will trigger a change in our response strategy.  This will require the effort of all levels of Government, the public health system and our communities as we face these challenges together.  We are focusing now on preparing in other areas, including development of guidance for our health care practitioners, and planning for increased demand on our health care system.  One important aspect of this is taking steps to make sure there are enough supplies and appropriate guidance to prevent the spread of the disease, especially among health care personnel caring for patients.  We understand the importance of providing guidance that health care facilities can implement given the availability of personal protective equipment or PPE supplies.  CDC talks regularly with health care industry partners as well as PPE manufacturers and distributors to assess availability of PPE.  At this time, some partners are reporting higher than usual demand for select N95 respirators and face masks.  CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general public.  This virus is not spreading in the community.  If you are sick or a patient under investigation and not hospitalized, CDC recommends wearing a face mask when around other people and before entering a health care provider’s office, but when you are alone, in your home, you do not need to wear a mask.  People who are in close contact with someone with novel coronavirus, for example, household contacts and care givers of people with known or suspected 2019, I’m sorry, nCoV 2019, we should wear a face mask if they are in the same room as the patient and that patient is not able to wear a face mask.  Health care personnel should wear PPE including respirators when caring for confirmed or possible nCoV patients because they’re in direct contact with those patients which increases their risk of exposure.  We will continue to work with our public health partners around the clock to address this public health threat.  Some good news this week is that yesterday the first group of 195 people who returned from Wuhan on a State Department flight completed their 14-day quarantine.  None of those people have this new virus, and all left March Air Reserve Base successfully and happily returned along the way to their families and their communities.  It’s important that people understand that these people being released from quarantine pose no health threat to the surrounding communities or the community that they will be returned to.  I want to extend my thanks to them for their cooperation and patience during the quarantine and wish them well as they return to home, work and school.  I also want to thank the men and women on March Air Reserve Base and their families for their graciousness while hosting these guests.  I also want to say that CDC is working in close collaboration with Japanese health authorities to ensure precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of disease on the Diamond Princess cruise ship as well as making sure the American citizens on that cruise ship are safe.  We recognize the continued uncertainty of the current situation. As always CDC public health experts strive to make the best recommendations based on the most up-to-date data.  I would be happy to take questions now.
Operator: Thank you.  We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  In order to provide everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow up.  If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself back into the queue and your additional questions will be answered as time permits.  To ask a question, please press star followed by one.  Please ensure your phone is unmuted and record your name clearly when prompted.  Again, that is star followed by 1 to ask a question.  If you need to withdraw your request press star 2.  One moment for the first question.  Our first question is from Richard Harris with NPR.  You may go ahead.
Richard Harris: Thanks very much.  I have a point of clarification and then a question.  And my clarification is based on your description of what happened with the test mix up, it sound as though somebody was misidentified as being positive and this person was misidentified as being negative, right, and then you realized that you had the identities wrong and you switched them.  I want to make sure that I understand that.  Let me ask my question also, which is a little more in-the-weeds, but I’m interested to know what the status is of being able to have a stereological test to identify people who have been exposed but haven’t shown signs of disease.  Where is that right now?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: The answer of the first question is thanks for asking me to clarify because no, that is not exactly right.  Because of the problem with identification of the patient, the initial run didn’t include that.  You know, as you can imagine, at CDC, there are a large number of specimens being processed, coming in and out, and it’s important that they be identified appropriately so that they’re prioritized. Because of the way that sample was identified, it wasn’t run in that first run.  Therefore, it was when the second run was done that we found that it was positive, so it isn’t that somebody else was identified as positive.  The sample wasn’t initially run.  And the answer to your second question is clearly a stereological test is important in the United States we want to be able to look to see if people zero converted but especially hopefully we’ll be able to help the Chinese look.  That test would be really helpful to be able to understand the spectrum of illness that is are there people who are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic that have stereological evidence of being exposed to pathogens.  We have the beginnings of the stereological tests, because we now have patients in the United States, we’re able to collect additional specimens but we have to collect them over time so that we can have the appropriate timing of specimens to make sure that we understand what the immune response looks like.  Once we complete the gathering of those specimens from the patients we’ll be able to pretty rapidly, I would say within a couple of weeks, three weeks, four weeks, be able to have a test available but right now, we’re still in the range of testing of gathering the appropriate specimens from the patients in the U.S. Next question.
Operator: thank you, the next question is from Ivan Couronne with “AFP,” you may go ahead.
Ivan Couronne:  Thank you.  Have any of the test kits already been actually shipped outside of the U.S.?  And if so, which country?
Operator: One moment, please stand by.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: I’m here.  Thank you, I’m sorry.  I didn’t get off mute, so excuse me.  We have shipped the test kit internationally.  I don’t have the specific list of countries in front of me.  On last count and this is a couple of days ago, it was somewhere more than 30 countries.  It’s important to recognize that this is part of a normal procedure that CDC uses for exactly this kind of reason, to get help make test kits available to other countries who may not have easy access to the same reagents and resources that CDC does, so it’s test kits and each of those countries that are receiving it will go through the same procedures that the recipients in the U.S. are, which is they would do an internal validation verification process before they’d be using those kits, so I also don’t know yet, and we can follow up on this whether any country that has received the kits has gone through that process yet, and whether countries have actually used it.  I just don’t have that in front of me.  Next question.
Operator:  Thank you, the next question is from Hillary Bourke with “Business Insider,” you may go ahead.
Hillary Bourke: Yeah, thanks for taking my call.  I had a question about the incubation period.  I’m wondering what you think about the new paper that  suggests it’s possible the virus might incubate for as long as 24 days in some cases.  Have you seen any evidence to support that idea so far?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Yeah, so, it’s a really interesting report that has come out.  As you can imagine, there is a lot of data coming out and a lot of scientists appropriately are rushing to make sure that any data that they have is in the public realm where all the rest of the scientific community can make use of it.  I applaud everyone’s efforts.  We have seen in some situations the rush to get data published hasn’t necessarily led to there being the usual level of oversight to make sure that each of the findings is quality controlled, frankly.  So, we’re looking at that data closely, but we’re frankly looking at all the other data that’s available that looks at incubation periods.  I would say the incubation period is obviously really important for us as we look to make sure that we’re releasing these people safely from quarantine, but the abundance of data, that is available still is consistent with our current stance, which is to use 14 days as the end of that incubation period.  I also would say that this is a confusing situation because there may be patients that have mild or even asymptomatic disease that isn’t recognized and when you look at incubation period, you’re starting at the point where a patient is exposed and then counting the days until that patient mounts symptoms.  But if there is widespread community spread, for example, it may be that some of those initial exposures aren’t detected and it makes it hard to be sure about the actual incubation period.  Our CDC staff there actually are something like 50 separate modeling groups in the United States that are working with us on exactly these issues.  It’s important that we work with all of these modelers because they have different symptoms than we do, but we’re working with all of the greatest minds in the country and globally try to pin down these facts as much as we can, and we still think that for today, for now, 14 days is the right interval to use.  Next question.
Operator: Thank you.  The next question is from Mike Stobbe with the “Associated Press,” you may go ahead.
Mike stobbe: Hi, thank you for taking my call.  My initial question is I need to ask about this, the reports out of China, the cases reported dropped down significantly the last couple of days.  I know it’s just two days, but they were in the 3,000 range and now they’re 2,478 and 2,050, that dropped, what if anything do you make of that, and my follow-up question is about you discussed the kits going out to the states, could you say a little  more about did kits go to all 50 states and were you expecting that they’d be up and running this week but now it means it’s going to be two weeks from now.  Could you help us better understand the impact of what’s going on and what kind of delay it entails, thank you.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Sure.  It’s only two questions this time.  Good.  So, the Chinese cases dropping down, I’m going to be optimistic that that is a sign that their aggressive efforts have been effective, but I really do think it’s too soon to say that for sure, not having hands on the data ourselves.  There is a WHO advanced team in China now, and I’m hopeful that they will have access to the data themselves and be able to validate those findings.  It would certainly be reassuring if we were now seeing at least a slowdown of this outbreak in China.  So that’s the first question.  The second question is a little complicated but what I would say is that of course we hoped that everything would go smoothly as we rushed through this, you know.  We moved quickly, that’s appropriate under these circumstances but it’s equally appropriate to do quality control which is what we do, and where these — where this issue was caught, it is part of the normal procedures.  Of course, I hoped that this week every state — and every state did receive a kit — every state would be up and running.  How long is it going to take?  I can’t tell you that for sure because I understand that not every state has completed their verification yet.  And it won’t be until we have results from every state that we know which states can continue and which states we need to — we need to get new reagents to.  We’re working closely with FDA.  Again, we do expect this week that some states may move forward.  Other states may need to get additional reagents from CDC, and I don’t have an estimate yet from our laboratory staff as to how long that takes, and when we do, we will definitely be, first, letting the states know and then letting you all know.  Next question.
Operator:  Thank you.  The next question comes from Denise Grady with “New York times.”  You may go ahead.
Denise Grady: Hi, thank you very much.  I’ll ask you both questions.  One is could you please go over the criteria, so we understand exactly who is being tested, who’s qualified for testing and then if the result is negative, does it mean anything?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: I’m sorry, I’m going to just pause because there’s an ambulance going through.  Just wait.  Okay.  So, let’s see, the criteria for testing in the United States focuses on people who are ill with the spectrum of symptoms that we have associated with this, which is fever, respiratory symptoms, cough, shortness of breath who have had appropriate travel history or who have been identified as contacts of a confirmed patient.  And so, in each of the states where these cases have been identified, we’ve been looking at potential contacts of patients as to look to see if it spread, that contact tracing did identify the two cases that we say weren’t directly associated with travel.  Those are in close contacts of two patients who traveled but outside of those close contacts around confirmed cases, our focus right now is on people who have a travel history that is consistent with where this outbreak is spreading.  And we’re comfortable with that as the basic criteria because so far, we are not seeing widespread community spread in the United States.  That is that the cases we’re seeing are all directly linked with travel to Hubei and China.  It is also true that we did some testing of asymptomatic people, but it wasn’t in the setting of trying to make a clinical diagnosis.  It was in the setting of using that to try to learn more about how this is being spread, and I think people may have misunderstood it.  We did that in the first 195 people who were repatriated into the United States, but we have not been testing asymptomatic people who have returned on the other repatriation flights.  And that relates to this question of what being negative means.  If we have a patient who is symptomatic and has the right travel history, a negative means that at least at that point we don’t think they have disease.  If a patient is at very high risk in clinical discussions with their health care provider and health department, they may be tested again.  If they’re at very high risk.  But in general, in a symptomatic patient, a negative, we think means that they’re negative.  The difference is that when we were using it at march air force base to learn more about how this was being spread, it is possible that someone could be negative and still be incubating the virus and therefore we, in that setting, didn’t judge a negative to let us be confident that somebody was able to be released from quarantine.  So that’s the distinction that we’re making.  Next question.
Operator: Thank you.  The next question comes from Julie Steenhuysen with “Reuters,” you may go ahead.
Julie Steenhuysen: Thanks, I have a couple of questions.  First off, we know now that the w.h.o. Has a team in China.  Are you — are any representatives from the CDC a part of that team?  And can you say a little bit more about what kinds of problems the state labs encountered in validating the tests and why you need to send new reagents and finally are there any more flights expected from China carrying U.S. citizens?  Thanks.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Okay.  The advance team is three WHO staff.  They’re staff that are well known to us.  They have a lot of experience.  They are being articulated as an advance team, and I heard a report from them this morning.  They’re getting access to data, and doing the things you would expect them to do and as you all know, CDC stands ready to send staff to the affected areas in China to work on this investigation and as soon as we’re given the invitation, we are happy to do that, but we haven’t been invited yet.  More planes, I think there is continued conversation that Americans who are still in Wuhan or other parts of China, so those conversations are ongoing, and I don’t have any specific information right now as to whether there will be additional folks repatriated in groups like we saw with these planes.  So, I don’t have any specific information on that.  In terms of the test problems, it gets a little weedy, but I can give you a little more detail.  When a state gets the test kits, they have to verify that it works the same in their lab that it worked at CDC.  And when some states were doing this, we received feedback that they weren’t — that it wasn’t working as expected, specifically some public health labs at states were getting inconclusive results and what that means is that test results were not coming back as false positive or false negatives, but they were being read as inconclusive.  Now, these were not tests being run on actual clinical specimens from potential patients.  These were part of the verification process, and because of that we are — when we evaluated what the issue is, we think that there might be an issue with one of the three assays and we think that maybe one of the reagents wasn’t performing consistently, so it’s a long story to say that we think that the issue at the states can be explained by one reagent that isn’t performing as it should consistently and that’s why we are re-manufacturing that reagent, obviously a state wouldn’t want to be doing this test and using it to make clinical decisions if it isn’t working as well as perfectly at the state as it is at CDC, so this is part of a normal process and procedure and redoing the manufacturing is the next step.  Next question.
Operator:  Thank you.  The next question comes from Erika Edwards with NBC news.  You may go ahead.
Erika Edwards:  Yeah, just to follow up on that, are all the tests still coming through the CDC in Atlanta for conclusive results while the states work out their issues?  And separately, I just wanted to learn more about your thoughts on that growing number of cases on the cruise ship docked in japan.  I mean, is there anything that CDC is even able to do to help the Americans on board?  Thanks.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Yeah, thanks for the clarification and yes, all clinical specimens are still being sent to CDC for validation.  I think you would expect nothing less from us as obviously the results of this test are so meaningful, and we’ll continue to provide that backstopping frankly even after states are up and running.  I would ask that you — that the right language wouldn’t be a problem with the states.  It’s a collective problem, so I don’t want this to be seen as something that the states are doing incorrectly.  That is certainly not the situation here.  This is really part of a normal process and procedure, and, you know, we have the quality control set up specifically to allow us to identify these kinds of problems.  In terms of the cruise ship, I know that there are Americans on board, there are certainly Americans that are ill and it’s certainly concerning the high number of cases on that cruise ship.  We are working closely with the embassy in japan, and the state department to help with thinking through what’s the right actions.  Somebody from the state department may be on the phone, and if so, I’ll ask them if they want to make a comment on this.  Ben, is somebody there?
Benjamin Haynes: No, Nancy, sorry, nobody from —
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Okay.  So, I guess they’re probably not on the phone because they’re helping — working with us to think through what to do.  Obviously, it’s a high priority to make sure that the people that are already sick or the people that are still on the ship and asymptomatic are getting the best care possible.  We want to protect their health, and we’re working closely, again, through the embassy on thinking through what the right next steps are, and when there’s more information, we will clearly make that available as quickly as possible.  Next question.
Operator:  Thank you.  The next question comes from Tom Howell with the “Washington Times.”  You may go ahead.
Tom Howell:  Hi, thanks for doing the call.  Just branching off the question about the cruise ship, do you have any numbers of how many Americans are on board and how many of them might be infected if any?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  I actually don’t have those numbers in front of me but what I would say is there are definitely Americans on board who have been diagnosed with and now I have to get this name right, nCoV 19.  Excuse me for not getting it right.  I’m still working on it.  There are Americans on board that have been diagnosed with nCoV 19, but I don’t have the numbers on me right now, and we can certainly follow up.  Next question.
Operator:  Thank you, the next question comes from Nate Wetzel with “The Hill,” you may go ahead.
Nate Wetzel:  Hi, thanks for doing this call.  I’m just wondering, there have been reports that the virus might either weaken or sort of die out as the weather gets warmer.  Do you have any evidence for that?  Has that been officially confirmed?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  So, I think I would caution overinterpreting that hypothesis.  I think what folks are saying, which I think is a valid point is that most viral respiratory diseases are seasonal, and we’ll use as an example influenza.  Influenza has a season.  It can alter a little bit but it’s generally, we know what time of year is going to be the peak of influenza and in general, as we head towards spring and summer, we expect the cases of influenza in the United States to fall off.  That’s true for other viral respiratory diseases also that have a winter season.  So, if this behaves similarly, it may be that as we head towards summer and, I guess, spring and summer, the cases would go down, but this is a new disease.  We haven’t even been through six weeks of it, much less a year, and so I certainly would, I mean, I’m happy to hope that it goes down as the weather warms up, but I think it’s premature to assume that, and we’re certainly not using that to sit back and expect it to go away.  The aggressive actions were taken or we’re taking are because we don’t think we can count on that since again, we haven’t been through even a single year with this pathogen.  Next question.
Benjamin Haynes:  Sue, we have time for one more question, please.
Operator:  Thank you.  Our last question comes from Steve Baragona with “voice of America,” you may go ahead.
Steve Baragona:  Hi, thanks for doing the call.  You mentioned a couple of times about information you’re getting from the Chinese.  I know that’s been an issue throughout this outbreak.  How is your access to data?  Are you getting all the information you need, and if not, what’s the hold up?  What impact does that have on your ability to respond?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  I’m happy to talk about this.  I’ll start by saying there’s nothing really new in this space compared to what we have said previously.  There has been a lot more data coming out of China in the recent weeks, compared to perhaps from the very beginning, and there have been meetings, for example, hosted by w.h.o.  Where Chinese authorities have presented their data.  As an epidemiologist seeing a graph that somebody else produced is never as good as touching the data yourself.  Being able to look at it yourself and being able to ask the questions and run the data directly, so having that distance from the actual ongoing investigation in China or anywhere is never the best way for us to be able to be completely confident that we understand the situation.  That is the — part of the reason that we want to have folks on the ground.  I’m working specifically on this investigation, the other is that I would say that CDC scientists are certainly some of the best in the world and our scientists have a lot to offer in terms of looking at what’s going on right now in terms of the analysis.  We also find that when you’re in the midst of doing an investigation yourself, sometimes it’s hard to step back and folks coming from outside who haven’t been so enmeshed in the day-to-day sometimes can pick up things you didn’t think of or have a different perspective.  That’s the other reason that it would be helpful to have a broader set of folks being able to look at the data itself.  I have nothing new to say in terms of the data coming out.  There is more coming out in the published literature but CDC staff themselves haven’t yet gained direct access to the data and we continue to be hopeful that we’ll be invited to do that.  Thank you.

Thank you.  Thank you all for joining us today for this briefing to update you on CDC’s COVID-19 response.  We’re joined by Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.  We’ll make opening remarks.  I turn the call over to Dr. Messonnier.
Good afternoon.  Thank you all for joining us.  As of today, there are more than 110,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide.  In the U.S., as of Sunday evening, 34 states plus New York City and D.C. have reported more than 500 cases of COVID-19 to CDC and 19 deaths.  Nearly half of reported cases are in California and Washington.  18 of the deaths are in Washington.  The remaining one is in California.  Right now the states with the most cases are California and Washington.  But other communities are also dealing with cases of COVID-19.  That’s why I’d like to talk to you today in greater detail about risk.  Risk can be looked at in two ways.  There is risk of being exposed and getting sick from this virus and there is risk of getting very sick or dying from illness with this virus.  This virus is capable of spreading easily and sustainably from person to person based on the available data.  The report of the World Health Organization mission to China describes the virus as being highly contagious.  And there’s essentially no immunity against this virus in the population because it’s a new virus.  Based on this, it’s fair to say that as the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the United States will at some point in time either this year or next be exposed to this virus and there’s a good chance many will become sick.  But again, based on what we know about this virus, we do not expect most people to develop serious illness.  Reports out of China that looked at more than 70,000 COVID-19 patients found that about 80% of illness had — was mild and people recovered.  15 to 20% developed serious illness.  Let’s talk about who those people are.  So far it seems like it’s not children.  Of the 70,000 cases, only about 2% were in people younger than 19.  This seems to be a disease that affects adults.  And most seriously older adults.  Starting at age 60, there is an increasing risk of disease and the risk increases with age.  The highest risk of serious illness and death is in people older than 80 years.  People with serious underlying health conditions also are more likely to develop serious outcomes including death.  The people who are at greatest risk are those older and who also have serious long-term health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or lung disease.  Last week CDC added guidance to our website for people who are at higher risk for serious illness.  Our goal is to protect you.  This will require you and your family to take action.  I’d like to go through our recommendations for people at highest risk.  Make sure you have supplies on hand like routine medications for blood pressure and diabetes.  And over-the-counter medicines and medical supplies to treat fever and other symptoms.  Have enough household items and groceries so that you will be prepared to stay home for a period of time.  Take everyday precautions like avoiding close contact with people who are sick, cleaning your hands often, and to the extent possible, avoid touching high touch surfaces in public places.  Avoid crowds especially in poorly ventilated spaces.  This weekend the federal government made a very specific recommendation in this context that travelers particularly those with underlying health issues defer all cruise ship travel worldwide.  We also recommend that people at higher risk avoid nonessential travel such as long plane trips.  Lastly, and most importantly, know what’s going on in your community.  If you could end up in the role of helping to care for a family member or friend who is at greater risk, we recommend you familiarize yourself with your loved ones’ medication and help them get extra to have on hand.  Help them also get food, medical supplies and other necessities so they can minimize trips to the store.  Create a plan for if they get sick and if you get sick.  You have to identify backups to take care of them.  Everyone has a role to play to protect our family members, friends, colleagues, and neighbors who are at most risk.  I understand these recommendations may not be popular and that maybe — and that they may be difficult for some people.  At CDC, our number one priority is the health and safety of the American people.  These are the kind of recommendations that I have made to my parents and I’m taking the appropriate steps recommended for family members of vulnerable people.  Other staff at CDC are doing the same.  We have more than 1,500 people who have worked on this response so far.  And we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously.  CDC is an essential component of the U.S. critical infrastructure on this response.  To date no one in CDC’s workforce has tested positive for COVID-19.  We will continue to work with the Office of Personal Management on federal government strategies and guidance.  Some businesses and local governments are already taking similar measures.  The point of these is to reduce exposures, reduce illness which in turn can protect our most vulnerable.  But it’s also a strategy to keep workplaces up and running though on a modified basis.  Government officials and public health departments will make decisions based on local conditions at the time.  We urge you to follow their lead.  Before I close, I want to give you an update on public lab capacity.  78 state and local public health labs across 50 states now have the capacity to test up to 75,000 people for COVID-19.  We will have more information online this afternoon for clinicians on how to access the tests.  The information will also be about the commercially available kits.  However, we want to caution people that different states will have different capacity for testing as well as different policies about who should be tested.  Lastly, I want to recognize and share your concern about the outbreak and what might happen here in the United States.  We’ve gotten a lot of questions about events and conferences where cases have been identified.  CDC is working with state and local public health departments to reach these people but we also want those who attended these functions to monitor themselves for COVID-19 symptoms and call their health care provider if they become ill.  Especially if they’re in a high risk group.  During an outbreak with the new virus, there is a lot of uncertainty.  Our guidelines and recommendations are likely to be interim and subject to change as we learn more.  We know that in South Korea no one under the age of 30 has died and in Japan no one under the age of 50 has died.  Data from these countries help us understand the potential risk here in the U.S. That’s why it’s so important for older adults and people with serious underlying health conditions to be prepared.  I’ll be happy to take questions now.
If you’d like to ask a question, please press star 1.  Record your name slowly and clearly.  Your name is required to introduce your question.  Our first question is from Tom Howell with the Washington Times, your line is open.
The first publicly documented case in mid-January is someone that traveled from China to Washington.  I want to know what about is there anything about that fact that speaks to what we’re seeing now in Washington state?  I’m just wondering if contact tracers investigated that and if there is any link to what we’re seeing now.  Thank you.
Messonnier: You may remember that the response to that initial case in the United States was quite aggressive with the health department having the lead in CDC supporting them.  They did very aggressive contact tracing looking to identify anybody who had had contact with that initial case and sort of concentric circles outward.  They didn’t find any evidence of COVID-19 in any of those contacts.  Now I think you’re probably referring to a publication that came out within the past couple of weeks looking at the genetic sequencing data of the initial patient versus — and comparing it to the cases that are now circulating in Washington state.  And one hypothesis that the author made was that the changes between the initial case and now suggested that the strain had been circulating in the population.  I think that’s an interesting hypothesis.  But another hypothesis is that a secondary seeding of the community and the strain causing the more recent cases in Washington state matches sequences that have been posted from China.  So I think that’s an interesting hypothesis.  I expect we’ll see more of it.  But there are alternate explanations of the same findings.
Thank you.  Next question, please.
Thank you.  Our next question comes from Issam Ahmed with AFP.  Your line is open.
Yeah.  Thank you for doing this.  I was wondering with regards to your advice about, you know, higher risk Americans inviting them to stock up on groceries and medicine at this point.  Where would you draw that cutoff at this point?  Is that for over 60?  Thank you.
Messonnier: Thanks for letting me clarify.  You know, I want to clarify the reason to stock up is that there is a rational for being in a higher risk group wanting to avoid congregate settings.  So it’s not — the reason to stock up now is so you can stick close to home.  The reason I went into data in greater detail is because it’s important for the American public to understand the risk.  We use the broad categories of over 60 or over 65, but the data really says that as you get older, the risk goes up and so in the broader age category of over 60 or over 65, over 80 or older has the greatest risk.  So I would recommend that people make their own decisions based on an understanding of that risk.  My parents are in their 80s.  They’re not in an area where there is currently community transmission.  But I’ve asked them to stick close to home so they can avoid the potential risk of being in congregate settings.
Next question.
Thank you.  Our next question comes from Eben Brown with FOX news.  Your line is open.
Thank you very much for taking my call.  I just want to piggyback on an earlier question.  There is even just for my own personal goings about a lot of empty shelves in stores and things like that.  There seems to be — I was in an airport the other day where someone had not just a regular old mask but like a big molded plastic mask with canisters on.  There seems to be like a growing — I don’t want to say panic, but kind of headed that way.  Is there a way that we all can provide some sobriety here because the last thing I think we all need is a panic but we want to be people vigilant and make the right decisions.
Messonnier: I think that’s a really great point.  And really important thing for the media to try to communicate.  You know, right now in the United States most communities by far the vast majority of communities are not having community transmission.  This is a time for people to prepare for what they might need to do but not a time for people to clear out the shelves.  And I really want to focus on the United States and the families at highest risk because in the setting where it’s really clear that it is older Americans who are at the highest risk right now, we want to make sure that they’re taking every precaution to prepare themselves so that if there is more widespread transmission, they can stick close to home.  In terms of masks, as you implied and I’ll say, we really do not think this is the time for Americans to be going out and getting masks.  Masks are really important for those at highest risk in the health care setting and we want to make sure that we save enough masks for our health care workers on the front lines who will need to continue to be able to do their work and take care of all of us.  So in particular in the setting of concern about masks, I ask people to please fight the urge to buy a mask and make sure we save them for the people that really need them.
Next question.
Thank you.  Our next question comes from Andrew Joseph from STAT.  Your line is open.
Hi.  Thanks.  Can you elaborate a little more on how you all see this potentially playing out?  Obviously, there are mitigation efforts and hopefully they work.  But you’re saying many people will get exposed this year or next.  So if you can just sort of explain what that might look like if it is kind of persists for months to years.
Messonnier: Yeah.  I think that as we said since the beginning, respiratory viruses that’s spread like this tend to spread.  And what we as a community need to do is do everything we can to protect ourselves and our families and our communities so that the — if it does spread, it is in a slower fashion so that we’re all better prepared and so that our health care sector can take care of patients.  We continue to believe that in most communities contact tracing is really appropriate because it identifies the contacts and keeping them from spreading can have a significant role in slowing this down.  You likely will see in some communities like in Seattle and in California more efforts towards broad fed community mitigation as an attempt at a community level to slow this spread.  I think we need to be — we need to make sure that we’re listening to our local health departments.  I also think people need to understand that there are personal responsibilities that we’re asking everyone in the United States to take to make sure that they’re doing their best to protect themselves and their families and their communities and right now especially to make really strong efforts to protect those who are older and at underlying risk.  As a community, the United States we can really mitigate the impact of this disease and as long as we work together that, will continue to be CDC’s goal.
Next question, please.
Thank you.  Our next question comes from Lindsey Tanner with the Associated Press.  Your line is open.  Lindsey, your line is open.  (No response)
Our next question comes from Roni Rabin with the New York Times.  Your line is open.
Hi.  Dr. Messonnier, can you be more specific by with have a high rate of diabetes and chronic conditions in people that are much younger than 80s, can you be more specific about people in their 40s and 50s should be doing and people in their 60s and 70s?
Messonnier: I think it’s really important for us to stress as we have I think throughout the course of this that we are making recommendations based on the available data and when more data becomes available fine tuning them and trying not to get beyond what we know.  What we know from the data is the highest risk is those in both older and with underlying health conditions.  There are reports of individuals who are adults but with serious underlying health conditions who have also had more serious outcomes.  And I think that if you’re in one of those groups separately or together that is underlying illness, underlying illness and older adult or underlying illness and younger, you need to be thinking towards what personal precautions you might want to take.  And certainly for those with diabetes and high blood pressure, managing your diabetes and high blood pressure is a priority.  When more data becomes available from our investigations in the United States and from our work globally investigating we’ll certainly provide more direct data.  But right now, there is not data to be as precise as we’re asking.
Next question, please.
Thank you.  Our next question comes from Brenda Goodman from WebMD.  Your line is open.
Hi, Dr. Messonnier, I was hoping that you could explain a little bit about the difference between containment and mitigation.  And also tell us if there are any communities in the U.S. that have moved from containment to mitigation, for example, Seattle?  And why.
Messonnier: Sure.  That’s a great question.  I think it’s really important to make it really clear that this is not an on/off switch that you switch from one to the other.  In general, containment means that you stop the spread.  What it has meant in this setting is decreasing the number of potentially exposed people coming into the United States through border control.  And then tracking every case and every potential contact, every case in order to keep them from spreading it further.  So very much sort of what you would imagine when you think about person x had in contact with person y and person y had contact with six others and tracking down every one of those individuals and asking them to stay home, you can, we’ve seen you can keep it from spreading further.  Mitigation is more community level interventions.  And what that means is that you’re working to decrease the impact of the disease on a community.  In Seattle and in California, they haven’t stopped entirely contact tracing but they have started mitigation.  And I think that you will likely see local health departments deciding when there is community spread to start turning on more of the mitigation measures even while they’re still doing some level of contact tracing.  So again, it’s not an on/off switch.  It’s a dimmer.  You will see I think lots more communities starting to implement some kind of mitigation measures when they’re seeing community spread.  It will look different in different places and that’s why it’s really important for folks to stay informed of what is going on in their local area and to follow their advice of the local health department.
We have time for three more questions.  Next question, please.
Thank you.  Our next question comes from Jose Paliey with Univision.  Your line is open.
Hi, doctor.  My question is New York City is an area with community transmission and earlier in the call you mentioned people should avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces.  My question is what does that mean for subways and busses where commuters like myself are regularly pressing up against each other in very tighten closed spaces.
Messonnier: Again, I think it’s really important for two different things.  One is to pay attention to the recommendations from your local health department which are going to be more tailored to the specific situation in terms of spreading your community and the risks.  In terms of avoiding crowded settings, our focus really is on those with the higher risk and oldest among us and especially those with underlying illnesses.  So for people again, older and underlying illnesses, we are recommending avoiding crowds, congregate settings because those are places where in general there is lots of transmission of respiratory diseases.  We’re asking individuals to be aware of the risks but individuals are going to have to make personal decisions based on their own situations.
Next question, please.
Thank you.  Our next question comes from John Tozzi with Bloomberg News.  Your line is open.
Thank you for taking the question.  I want to clarify.  You said earlier that 78 state and local health labs have the capacity to test up to 75,000 people.  Is that 75,000 in what period?  Is that cumulative?  Daily 75,000?  Weekly?
Messonnier: Cumulative.  Again, it’s the public health sector CDC lab kits, 75,000 but more are coming onboard soon.  75,000 cumulatively.  But, I think as you know the number of commercially available kits, the number of commercially available tests is much larger than that and our expectation within the next couple weeks is more and more commercial entities become – come onboard is the majority of the available testing will actually be from the commercial sector.
Okay.  Last question, please.
Thank you.  Our last question comes from Brianna Abbott with The Wall Street Journal.  Your line is open.
Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  As you mentioned, there have been cases that are now starting to be linked to conferences and mass gatherings.  Companies have taken steps to cancel these. I wonder from a public health perspective, is cancelling mass gatherings something we should broadly start doing or is that an overreaction?  Where do we stand on that?
Messonnier: It is really difficult to make those kind of pronouncements broadly.  I think the thing at this point we’re recommending is consideration of the local situation, consideration of what is going on in the locale where the event is being held.  But and also where people are coming from and what the event is and how big it is.  So the decisions, for example, in Seattle may look quite different than the decisions being made in a location right now where there is not community spread.  I think that we’re going to need to follow the local community’s lead.  And again, a lot depends on the population.  So we’re looking both at risk of exposure but also the risk to the individuals and as you look at those two factors together, in consultation with local and state health departments, decisions may be different in different events and different locations.

Ben Haynes: Thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for joining us for today’s telebriefing regarding the 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the proactive action the CDC is taking.  We’re joined today by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and Dr. Marty Cetron, director of CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. Drs. Messonnier and Cetron will provide opening remarks before taking your questions.  I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Messonnier.
Nancy Messonnier: Great.  Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to provide you with an update regarding the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan City, China, which has been identified as being caused by a novel coronavirus.  This is a serious situation.  We have faced this challenge before first with SARS and later with MERS.  Both outbreaks were complex and required a comprehensive public health response.  Because of that experience, we know it’s crucial to be proactive and prepared.  Frist, outbreaks of new diseases among people are always a public health concern.  Second, while the discovery of a new virus can be exciting, we are still learning about it.  This means our recommendations will continue to evolve as we learn more about the virus.  Since the outbreaks of MERS and SARS, we have made improved in our capacity in the United States and around the world.  We’re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively.  Based on the information that CDC has today, we believe the current risk from this virus to the general public is low.  For a family sitting around the dinner table tonight this is not something that they generally need to worry about.
Now I would like to provide you with the most current information we have.  Please know that we are still early in this response and the situation is still evolving hour by hour and day by day.  On December 30th, China reported an outbreak of respiratory disease in Wuhan City, it’s a major transportation hub about 700 miles south of Beijing with the population of more than 11 million people.  An investigation led by local officials identified a new coronavirus as the cause of the outbreak.  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people, and others that circulate among animal, including camels, cats, and bats.  Rarely animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people.  This was the case with MERS and SARS.  There have been a lot of developments in this outbreak over the last few days, and I want to share what we know based on the latest public health reports.  Regarding the source, most of the patients in the outbreak have reportedly had some link to a large seafood and live animal market which does suggest animal to human spread.  The market was closed early this month for disinfection and cleaning.  In terms of severity, China has reported 45 cases to date.  The most recent four cases were just reported within the past hour or two.  And there have been two deaths.  Those patients who died were older adults.  And one of the two patients had known serious underlying medical conditions.  Some patients have been described as being seriously ill, while others have recovered and been discharged from the hospital.  As relates to the spread of the virus, we’re still learning more.  While most of these infections seem to be happening from animals to people, there is some indication that limited person-to-person spread is happening, including outside of Asia.  Just this week, three cases outside of China have been identified, two in Thailand, one in Japan, all in travelers from Wuhan.
Now I’d like to talk a little bit about what CDC has been doing.  Last week we established an incident management structure to coordinate our response.  We’re monitoring the international situation with our teams on the ground in China, Thailand, and Japan as well as working closely with colleagues at the World Health Organization.  We have been updating the CDC web site daily to include new information and I would direct you there for the latest case counts and updated information in terms of our response.  We issued a level one travel notice first, which reminds travelers to practice usual cautions for Wuhan City, China, that was earlier this month and we’ve continued to update it based on new information.  We sent out a health advisory via the Health Alert Network updating health care workers and public health partners on this outbreak and will be sending out additional guidance either later today or tomorrow.  Our laboratory is using genetic sequences provided by the Chinese and already has the ability to identify this pathogen were it to occur in the United States.  We’re working on a specific diagnostic test to detect this virus and we’ll be distributing this test to state health departments.  I’m going to stop there and hand over the briefing to my colleague, Dr. Marty Cetron, the Director of the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.  He’ll talk to you about the precautions we’re taking at airports to identify possible novel coronavirus cases.  Marty.
Marty Cetron: Thank you, Nancy.  To further protect the health of the American public during the emergence of this new coronavirus, beginning today CDC will be screening passengers on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan.  This will begin tonight at New York, JFK airport, the first of the three main airports and one of the two that receive direct arriving flights from Wuhan.
While a remarkable amount has been learned since the first detection of this virus last month, it’s still early and much remains unknown as Dr. Messonnier pointed out. The investigation into this novel coronavirus is ongoing and dynamic, and CDC is actively engaged on the many fronts that Dr. Messonnier outlined.  We are preparing across the public health and health care system to prevent, detect, and respond to this novel coronavirus.  The earlier we detect a case, the better we can protect the public and the more we can understand about this virus, and its risk for spread.  CDC will implement public health entry screening at San Francisco airport, New York JFK and LAX airport.  These airports receive the vast majority of travelers from Wuhan.  As I mentioned, JFK and also San Francisco are the only two airports in the United States with direct flights from Wuhan.  LAX was included because of the equivalent large volume of passengers coming from indirect flights.
Entry screening is only one part of a layered approach that includes alerting the nation’s public health system and health care delivery systems.  When used with other public health measures already in place for rapid detection of ill arriving travelers, we can slow and reduce the spread of disease into the United States.  It is early in this outbreak.  The virus is novel, and while we have experience with SARS and MERS, humility is important.  There is much work to be done as the outbreak investigation unfolds and is very dynamic as you heard.  As we learn more about this newly emerging virus, CDC will adjust its screening and response procedures appropriately.  Thank you.
Ben Haynes: Thank you, doctor and doctor, Michelle, we are ready to open up for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir.  At this time, if you would like to ask a question or if you do have any comments, you may press star one.  Please unmute your phones and state your name when prompted.  Again, that is star one for any questions.  One moment, please.  Andrew Joseph from STAT, you may go ahead, sir.
Andrew Joseph: Hi, thanks very much.  With three exported cases identified already but only 45 identified in Wuhan, are you working under the assumption that the outbreak is actually bigger than that in Wuhan, that you think there might be more unidentified cases so far?
Nancy Messonnier: Yes, this is Dr. Messonnier, and I would say that this is the stage of the investigation we need to proceed cautiously and be prepared to respond quickly to any eventuality.  So of course we’re generally concerned that there might be more cases, but we need to wait until our colleagues in China complete their investigation.  That said, that is one of the reasons we’re standing up screening in the United States to make sure that we have the means to detect a case early here so that we can detect it early and learn more about it.
Andrew Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from Mike Stobbe with the Associated Press, you may go ahead.
Mike Stobbe: Thank you for taking my call.  Just a couple.  I wanted to make sure to clarify, CDC is trying to develop the diagnostic test to determine the virus, but when you all will be screening people, you’ll be looking at symptoms.  You won’t be able to actually test for the virus, is that correct?  And I also wanted to ask, just want to make sure I have the most current information.  There’s not screening planned at the Wuhan airport or in China or underway right now.  It’s screening on the receiving end, not before they get on the plane?  Thank you.
Nancy Messonnier: I think we’ll trade off on those questions.  The diagnostic one is mine.  We actually do have laboratory diagnostics here at CDC that are stood up.  The first diagnostic that we’d be relying on is based on sequence.  My compliments to our colleagues in China.  They identified this pathogen very quickly and quickly put that sequence up where it’s publicly available to all the scientists around the world.  That is how our colleagues in Japan and Thailand identified cases.  They compared the sequences that they found in their patients to the sequence that the Chinese collaborators posted.  So we at CDC also have the ability to do that today, but we are working on a more specific diagnostic.  We expect to have that imminently, and samples from patients who are appropriately identified with screening both at the airports or elsewhere in the United States, CDC stands ready to actually do laboratory diagnostics tests to identify whether they do have novel coronavirus.  Marty.
Marty Cetron:  Yeah, so Mike, your question about what, I think you were asking whether we’re going to be doing any diagnostics at the airport, and the answer to that is no.  We will do symptom-based screening in persons that have the epi link to Wuhan, and we will take a temperature, and then we will triage for evaluation those patients of concern where they will be referred to a facility that can do a regular diagnostic work up and collect the specimens that Nancy was referring to in terms of sending to CDC for reference testing for coronavirus.  So that’s the basic sequence.  Regarding exit screening in Wuhan, to the best of our knowledge, it is not ongoing at this time although there have been many people who have pointed out that the efficiency of exit screening obviously on a global perspective is an important step that compliments entry screening activities.  So, one is hopeful that that will move but as you can imagine, Wuhan is a dealing with a lot of issues at the present and will continue to, you know, apply the requests through formal channels that exit screening also be added to the compliment of the tool box.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you, Denise Grady from the New York Times, you may go ahead.
Denise Grady: Hi, thank you very much.  I just want to specify a little more, what exactly does screening involve.  Is there also any kind of question, are you looking only at temperature, are you looking at coughing, how do you tell apart somebody who’s coughing and has got a runny nose to someone who might be of concern, and once you do decide a person is of concern, where exactly are they going to be taken?  And what about people traveling with them?  What kind of plans are in place to deal with this if somebody is thought to be a possible case?
Marty Cetron:  Thanks for that question.  Excellent question.  We will be capturing the information of the person who comes, in addition we will be asking questions about symptoms, and we will be taking a temperature check.  And those that have symptoms that are compatible and a fever will be moved to what we call a tertiary screening by our quarantine medical officers for further investigation regarding exposures and contact and family issues.  But all members of the family will go through the same screening.  The sick individual will be triaged to evaluation in preidentified designated facilities and we have been working with our public health partners and our clinical partners as well as the transport services and we have been through this type of protocol before in 2014 and 2016, during the Ebola entry screening which lasted many months, over a year.  And those individuals will be transported safely, without exposing others, and evaluated under CDC guidance for infection control precautions and recommendations.  And that’s the basic sequence.  The ability to make the — refine the diagnosis and your point is well taken, we’re in the middle of respiratory virus season.  It will be far more likely that these symptoms will be caused by the common circulating winter viruses, including influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, and many others than it will be this novel virus.  While we have been in contact with some of our partners that are screening in other countries, it is our understanding that they have screened thousands before they found these one and two individual cases.  So, we are expecting that, you know, this is going to be a triage scenario, and there is the capability in these referral centers for doing rapid diagnostics for the other causes of respiratory illness.  So, thank you for your question.
Denise Grady: Thank you.  Are you able to tell us where the facilities are, where people are going to be taken in these cities, New York, San Francisco, LA?
Marty Cetron:  We generally — we generally don’t, you know, pre-identify publicly those institutions>  But needless to say there’s extensive preparedness network that has gone on for a very long time to identify the facilities that have the appropriate precautions and capability to deal with patients like this.  And I have been just updated that perhaps as of today or this morning, Wuhan may be beginning exit screening.  We’ll confirm that, but some of the media reports are indicating that.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you.  Leana Sun from the Washington Post, you may go ahead.
Lean Sun: Yes, hi.  I have a couple of questions.  Thank you.  Dr. Messonnier, do we know more about whether people are in the limited human-to-human transmission, if they can only spread when they’re symptomatic, and also Dr. Marty Cetron, could you please give us a sense of the volume of flights coming directly or connecting from Wuhan to these airports?  I believe the top 20 airports from Wuhan are all in Asia, but of course, from Bangkok, Hong Kong, Taipei, a ton of them come here.  Where do the US arriving flights sort of fit in that volume space?
Nancy Messonnier: Okay.  That was only two questions.
Lean Sun: I have a follow up, but I’m holding it.
Nancy Messonnier: The answer to the first question is we don’t know.  MERS and SARS, which are similar to this novel coronavirus, we know from investigation of those two viruses that they are more likely to spread when somebody is more contagious and that asymptomatic people can spread, but at a much lower rate.  So, it certainly is reasonable to ask the same question of this coronavirus, but it really would be premature to conclude that because we frankly don’t have enough information yet and that’s why we are taking this cautious approach.
Lean Sun: Okay.  Again, just ask a quick follow up to that related question, you know, the Chinese have been giving out some information but they haven’t given any kind of time line when people were symptomatic, how long they were sick for, any of that detail.  Have you guys pressed them for that, or do you already have that information?
Nancy Messonnier: We don’t have all the information at the level of detail that our scientists would prefer.  You know CDC scientists and we want to see every tidbit of data ourselves and that’s not the situation we’re in right now.  We are in more of a waiting mode, waiting to see what our colleagues from China are releasing.  It is a fast-moving situation, again, as identified, you know, again within the past hour, four more cases have been reported.  Things are still moving fast and information is still coming on.  We generally know that the incubation period is around 2 to 14 days, and there’s nothing that we’ve seen with this outbreak that is not consistent with that, but we really don’t have the level of detail that would allow us to be really completely confident that this virus is behaving the way that we expect.
Marty Cetron:  About the travel volume, just to give you some feel.  So we have data, we look at data from the past year, and then we actively are getting data from each day’s arrivals confirming not only the capacity of a flight but how many bodies are in seats.  And the annual data in general arrivals for the past year from Wuhan with itineraries originating in Wuhan and ending in the United States is over 60,000, probably ranging from 60 to 65,000 per year.  There’s some asymmetry in that not all months are equal, the peak seasons in China travel to the U.S. are January and August; January being the largest.  About 10% of that total usually arrives in January due to the Chinese Lunar New Year which is up coming. And we also have weekly estimates for these three airports and we’re expecting that the screening over the next couple of weeks could include as many as 5,000 people across the three airports [editor’s clarification: there are about 5,000 people per month with direct or indirect flights from Wuhan]. But it will really vary, and this is something each day that we get sort of an updated number.  What’s different and unique about this is the two, the two direct flights which happen three times a week, and those are full planeloads of people that will originate.  Recall that during 2014-16, there were no direct flights from West Africa to the United States, they were all indirect.  So, we’ll be screening episodically these large volume of arrivals three times a week from JFK and San Francisco in particular.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please, Michelle.
Operator: Thank you.  Nurith Aizenman from NPR.
Nurith Aizenman: I have a question from each of you and also a follow up.  The first question is from the test.  I’m trying to picture this.  Someone comes in, they do have symptoms.  Maybe they have something that makes you think they really should be screened.  They’re taken to this location, you know, and then the test is done, how quickly, if they’re testing for the things that are easily known, you can easily identify if it’s something other than this new coronavirus, how quickly would that occur realistically, are we talking an hour, like all day, overnight, just some sense of like the time line that someone might be detained.  The other question is, again, on this issue of the incubation period, are we seeing, I mean, there’s been dribs and drabs about when the last symptoms were — onset of symptoms were reported by these cases but it sounds like it’s limited to kind of early January.  Are we — are you seeing, you know, is it normal to expect kind of a gap in cases and then a reemergence of new cases if there is a lot of human-to-human transmission going on?  In other words, like, 14 days on basically around now, we’d start to see like suddenly a new flourishing of cases?
Marty Cetron: So, let me take the issue just to clarify about where the diagnostic testing is going to go.  People that come to the secondary screening and we have surge CDC staff to these ports obviously, and when they answer the questionnaire, if there’s no concerns about signs or symptoms and they’re afebrile, they’re going to be given a card that they can carry with them as to what symptoms to be alert for in the ensuing 14 days, and how to safely contact and interact with the health care system for care.  Those folks would be moving on, and we’ll expect we’ll be able to process them in moving on quite quickly without significant delays.  For the folks that actually have suspicious signs and symptoms and concerns, they will have a more detailed exam and an inquiry about exposures in tertiary at the airport.  Many of those folks will likely end up being referred for further evaluation.  It is unlikely that they will be able to make an immediate connecting flight if they had one, and so the types of diagnostics, screening diagnostics for common viruses can be done quite quickly but it’s still sort of an amount of hours of turn around in that process.  The specimens can then be collected at the same time if there’s indications for the novel coronavirus.  Currently they have to be shipped to CDC and tested here in reference labs.  And the speed with which that turn around occurs will continue to improve over time as we get these laboratory processes up and running for throughput.  But perhaps Dr. Messonnier can talk about what the expected time frame is in the screening process.
Nancy Messonnier: We’re sort of on the verge of having a more parsimonious laboratory test, and that will improve things right now.  If it was right now today it might be as much as a day but it’s going to get rapidly faster as we work so rapidly on our diagnostics.  The second questions of sort of a, I would take it as a theoretical question about incubation periods and waves as opposed to a specific question because I mean I think what you’re asking is, is it possible for there to be one wave and then a lull and then a second wave.
Nurith Aizenman: Exactly.  I mean, essentially as we’re looking at what’s happening, right, and we’re trying to figure out what does this tell us, and is it possible that the fact that we haven’t seen a whole lot of cases yet out of Wuhan, doesn’t necessarily tell us much because maybe you would expect to see the next wave like around now is when you would start to expect to see the next wave if there is indeed significant human-to-human transmission?
Nancy Messonnier: Yeah, I think what I would say about that is, you know, we’re trying — I mean, of course we’re hypothesizing and like you, trying to put this story together and see if we can find an easy explanation, but at the same time, even as we speak, more information is flowing in as the Chinese investigators continue their investigations in terms of familial clustering and what exact exposure, what proportion of these cases actually were in the market and what weren’t.  So I think it’s a little hard to completely feel confident that we have every bit of information and what I would generally say is I think that this is a situation where we’re going to see additional cases all around the world as folks look for it more.  Respiratory illnesses in general have a spectrum of illness, and generally we tend to find people who are more on the severe end of illness, but as we start testing more, and as lots of countries stand up diagnostic testing, I expect that we’re going to see more cases, and I think it’s highly  plausible that there will be at least a case in the United States, and that’s the reason that we’re moving forward so quickly with this screening that Dr. Cetron is talking about.
Ben Haynes: Next question, please, Michelle we have time for two more.  Sorry.
Operator: Thank you.  Dan Vergano from Buzzfeed News, go ahead.
Dan Vergano: Thanks for doing this.  Why a virus that starts in animals and spreads to people, and shows signs of spreading from people to people, it might be a particular concern in an outbreak like this, you know, like why the concern?
Nancy Messonnier: I think we are concerned anytime there is a new virus or a new pathogen emerging in a population that hasn’t seen it before because what it means is that populations don’t have existing immunity, and we don’t have specific treatments or vaccines.  So we’re always concerned about that.  In this particular situation, we are especially concerned about a novel coronavirus because we have the precedent of MERS and SARS, and those were quite complicated, difficult outbreaks with many people getting ill and deaths, and so understanding that this pathogen looks, at least from a genetic perspective, like those pathogens makes us especially worried.  It doesn’t take much for a virus in general to go from being worrisome to being extremely worrisome because they tend to morph and mutate a lot, and so that’s why in this class of viruses, we are especially worried and we’re taking a very cautious proactive approach.
Dan Vergano: Thank you very much.
Ben Haynes: Last question, please.
Operator: Thank you.  Elizabeth Cohen from CNN, you may go ahead.
Elizabeth Cohen: Hi, thank you so much for having this teleconference, I have two nuts and bolts questions for Dr. Cetron, I want to make sure I heard two things correctly, you said over the next few weeks we’re expecting 5,000 passengers from Wuhan, and two I think you said the JFK screenings start tonight at SFO, and LAX tomorrow, did I get those two things right?
Marty Cetron:  Yes, so the first direct flight from Wuhan scheduled arrival is around 10:00 p.m.  Tonight at JFK, and that will be the first fully screened flight.  The — we will serially roll those out.  The next direct flight arrives at San Francisco I believe around 11:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, and some of the indirect flights will be screened in LAX also beginning tomorrow morning.  So, we have surged as I indicated, you know, over a hundred CDC staff to these three airports and rough numbers I gave you around travel was across all three.  In terms of that, we’ll actually see realistically how many bodies are in the seats, this is projections based on some carrying capacity.  And then I believe it was either you or somebody else that asked about where does the U.S. sort of fit in that total scheme.  The — there was a report out that modeled that based on, I think it was 2018 data, the top destination countries, Thailand, Japan, and Malaysia.  These may have evolved a little bit in 2019, and they may be influenced a little bit on a monthly or seasonal basis as to what those orders are, but in general, the U.S. is, you know, not in that top tier as somebody indicated.  Most of these — most of this travel is in southeast Asia, and so the experience of screening that is going on in many southeast Asian countries right now will also be very ill illuminative, both about early detection of cases and the proportion of cases that trigger the screening, you know, as positive screening that actually get confirmed with the novel coronavirus will also help us a lot to find a little bit the scope and the magnitude of exportation.
Nancy Messonnier: Well, thank you for joining us today.  In closing, I do want to remind you that we’re still in the early days of this investigation.  Things continue to evolve.  We’re monitoring the situation closely.  We’re working to keep you informed every step of the way.  I also want to take a moment to thank the many partners with whom we are completely dependent and collaborating on this response.  The we here is not CDC in isolation, but clearly our state, local, territorial partners, CBP, FAA, the airlines.  Our ability to stand up this kind of response and our ability to intervene this quickly is entirely dependent on those collaborations as well as the many international collaborations in countries in which we’re working.  The risk of these outbreaks depends on the characteristics of the virus, including if and how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus such as antiviral treatments or vaccines.  The situation could indeed change quickly.  Therefore, we are taking a cautious approach to this outbreak and we’re preparing ourselves to respond quickly to any new developments, thank you again.
Ben Haynes: Thank you Dr. Messonnier and Dr. Cetron.  And thank you all for joining us for today’s briefing.  Please visit the 2019 novel coronavirus web page found at the bottom of the press release for continued updates.  If you have further questions, please call the CDC media office at 404-639-3286 or e-mail media @CDC.gov.

Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Thank you for joining us today.  Since we last briefed you CDC has confirmed additional five infections with novel coronavirus in the United States bringing the total number of confirmed positives in the U.S.  to 11.  The new cases include one patient identified in Massachusetts and four more patients in California.  Four of the five patients have travel history to Wuhan, China.  One patient in California is a close household contact of another patient in California.  This is the second instance of person-to-person spread in the United States.  We expect to find additional cases of novel coronavirus infection in the United States.  We expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread among close contacts.  And we continue to expect this will happen given the explosive nature of this outbreak in China and our very aggressive public health response where we are putting a lot of resources into finding infections this virus.  As of this morning, 167 persons under investigation, or PUIs as we call them, have tested negative for infection with the novel virus.  We currently have testing pending on 82 PUIs.  Some of the 82 that are pending include samples in transit to CDC.  As we have reported earlier, CDC has developed a real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction or RRT-PCR test that can detect 2019 Novel Coronavirus and respiratory and serum specimens from clinical specimens.  On January 24, CDC publicly posted the assay protocol for this test.  CDC has isolated the virus, and this week it is being sent to the NIH resource repository for use by the broad scientific community.  I’m pleased to report that, today CDC plans to submit an Emergency Use Authorization or EUA package to FDA.  The EUA process expedites the use of potentially life-saving medical or diagnostic products during a public health emergency.  Once approved, the EUA will allow public health labs across the United States to use the CDC developed diagnostic assay.  This will greatly enhance our national capacity to test for this virus.  In preparation for that approval, CDC has shipped the test to the International Reagent Resource so that States and international partners can begin ordering the test for their use.  Also on the topic of this test, I want to clarify something I said on Friday in relation to the people quarantined at March Air Reserve Base, that even if an initial screening test comes back negative from CDC’s laboratory, it does not guarantee these people won’t get sick.  There has been some confusion about that statement, and some people have taken that to mean the test doesn’t work.  That is not the case at all.  This is an accurate test.  A negative test most likely means a person is not infected.  However, it may mean that an infection has not developed enough to be detected by the test.  This is a new virus.  And the best timing and right type of sample to determine if someone is infected with this new virus has not yet been determined.  When confirming infections, CDC asks for multiple different types of samples from patients, including from the nose and the throat.  On Friday, the U.S. government also took unprecedented steps in the area of travel in response to the growing public health threat posed by this new coronavirus.  The intensity of transmission in Hubei province; the expansion to other provinces in China; the continued community transmission; the growing volume of exported cases to countries around the world; the continued reporting of deaths, including the first death outside of China; and reports of person to person spread outside China, including the United States, are all cause for concern.   Now I want to talk to you through the specifics of the travel policies announced late Friday afternoon.  We have a presidential proclamation in place that suspends entry of foreign nationals who have visited China within the past 14 days into the United States.  There are some exceptions.  Sorry, there are some exemptions including for immediate family members of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.  These people will be allowed entry into the United States.  It’s important to note that this policy is from mainland China, and it excludes people coming from Hong Kong and Macau.  We are also putting into place measure to detect this virus among those who are allowed entry into the United States who are entering the country within 14 days of having been in Hubei province or the rest of mainland China.  All of these passengers will be directed to one of 11 U.S.  airports.  At those airports, American citizens and exempted persons who have been in Hubei province in the previous 14 days will have an additional health assessment.  They will be screened for fever, cough, difficulty breathing.  If symptomatic, American citizens and those who are exempt will be transferred for further medical evaluation.  They will not be able to complete their itinerary and will be isolated for 14 days.  If asymptomatic, American citizens and those who are exempt will be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine at or near that location.  Remember, this is specifically for people who are returning from Hubei province.  These people will not be able to complete their itinerary.  CDC is working with state to determine where travelers will be quarantined.  American citizens and people who are exempt who have been in other parts of mainland China, that is outside of Hubei province, in the previous 14 days will have an additional health assessment where they will be screened for fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.  If symptomatic, they will be transferred for medical evaluation and they will not be able to complete their itinerary until that evaluation is completed.  If asymptomatic, American citizens and people who are exempt will be allowed to reach their final destination, and after arrival will be asked to stay home as much as possible and monitor their health for 14 days.  Today, CDC is issuing additional guidance for States on how to monitor this process.  And you should not be surprised to learn that we have been in constant contact with our State as well as Federal partners all through the weekend in working on operationalization of this policy.  We appreciate their patience and we also appreciate the cooperation of the American citizens and exempted people who are returning as we are reliant on their cooperation in order to implement these operations.  There is likely to be confirmed infections among returning travelers.  It’s important to know that this strategy is not meant to catch every single traveler returning from China with novel coronavirus.  Given the nature of this virus and how it’s spreading, that would be impossible.  But working together we can catch the majority of them, and the goal here is to slow the entry of this virus into the United States.  Our second line of defense in this strategy is a public health system which is on high alert.  We’ll continue to monitor the situation and adjust accordingly.  Either pulling back or strengthening these measures.  These actions are science based and deemed at protecting the health and safety of all Americans.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  I want to give you an update on another activity.  The Department of State is bringing more people back from Wuhan.  The first plane arrived last week.  More are planned.  Over the weekend CDC sent four additional teams to specific Department of Defense locations where those planes will arrive.  These passengers, like the ones in March air reserve base, will be under Federal quarantine that will last 14 days from when the planes left Wuhan, China.  Medical staff will monitor the health of these people, including temperature checks and observation for respiratory symptoms.  Medical care will be readily available at the first onset of symptoms.  We do not believe these people pose a risk to the communities where they are being temporarily housed as we are taking measures to minimize any exposure.  As I look around me at the staff working on this outbreak here at CDC, I see a lot of people who worked on the 2009 h1n1 pandemic.  Rather than coming from abroad, that virus was on our doorstep when we recognized it.  We didn’t have much chance to prepare.  Today we are again seeing the emergence of the new virus that poses a very serious public health threat.  This time we do have time to prepare, and we are preparing as if this were the next pandemic.  The goal of our public health response is to detect and contain introduction of this virus with the goal of preventing sustained spread of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in this country.  Strong measures now may blunt the impact of this virus on the United States.  We would be happy to take questions.
Benjamin Haynes:  Michelle, ready for questions.
Operator:  Thank you.  At this time if you would like to ask a question, you may press star 1.  Please unmute your phones and state your name when prompted.  Again star 1 for questions.  Hillary Brooke from Business Insider you may go ahead.
Hillary Brooke:  Yes.  Thanks for taking my call.  I just wanted to ask, we have been seeing some new claims out from places like PETA, that coronavirus is related to meat eating and some other myths like bleach cures.  I’m wondering what you are doing to combat this misinformation that’s circulating out there.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Yeah, thanks for that question and for the opportunity to say what we are doing is this.  We really count on all of you to try to set the record straight.  We do the best we can every day through all our appropriate communication channels.  And with all the inter-governmental partners and health departments also trying to transmit the messages to get the most accurate stories out there.  But we recognize this misinformation can rapidly spread, especially through social media.  I’m asking for your help to combat the spread of those rumors.  There is obviously no credible data that supports what you just said.  So, I’m really hoping that you’ll help us try to make sure the American public knows that we continue to believe they are currently low risk and that the focus right now is on travelers returning from places where this disease rate is soaring.
Benjamin Haynes:  Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you.  Elizabeth Cohen from CNN.  You may go ahead.
Elizabeth Cohen:  Hi.  Thanks so much for taking my question.  I wanted to reference the statement Dr. Messonnier mentioned about the what a negative test results mean.  So, based on what she said Friday, and also what she said today as well, are we retesting any of the 167 negatives?  If they are being retested, is there a certain protocol they are retested at certain intervals?  Are some being retested and some not?  Any thoughts on that?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:  Sure.  Happy to.  We tested those returning travelers as a hope that it would help us learn more about transmission of the virus in Hubei or in the community.  It was not meant to derive individual decision making, and I think has been misunderstood.  At this point our plan is really to use the test to look more closely at close contacts at individuals with the virus.  So if, for example, somebody on the base becomes ill and has novel coronavirus, we might think about using it around that individual.  But again, it’s really — using it as patients that are asymptomatic is not meant to be a diagnostic tool as much as it is to it be a public health tool and a population level to better understand the dynamics of the virus.  So, we don’t have any plans, for example, to do another cross-sectional look at those people at March Air Force Base.
Benjamin Haynes:  Next question, please.
Operator:  Mike Stobbe from the Associated Press.  You may go ahead.
Mike Stobbe:  Hi.  Thank you for taking my call.  Dr. Messonnier, I have a couple questions.  Did you say 11 airports?  I thought it was 7.  And also, could you update us on the quarantine.  Actually, I would love it if you would post on your website how many people are under Federal and State quarantine.  But is the number still 195, 200?  Or how many are?  And could you tell us a little bit more how many people are expected to come into quarantine later this week?  And also, I’m sorry, could you update us about will China has taken up CDC’s offer to help?  Are you expecting to send CDC folks?  And the last question, just for the folks at home, could you let us know why it continues to be called the 2019 nCoV.  Why isn’t it called like Yamagata or in this case the Wuhan virus?  Could you explain why that name in convention isn’t being followed with this new coronavirus?  Thank you.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:   Sure.  I’m going to try all of those.  I’ll start with the last one.  I think, the world’s health organization said weeks ago that this 2019 novel coronavirus name was a temporary name.  There are naming conventions and I suspect once people have a chance to catch their breath it will be changed.  It’s 2019 because that’s when the outbreak was determined to start.  I think that is just a temporary name.  My understanding there are plans down the road to clean that up.  In terms of the airports, I have this list, I’m going to read it to you.  Airports were added.  The list as of right now is 11 airports.  And they are; JFK in New York; O’Hare airport in Illinois; San Francisco International Airport in California; Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Washington; Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, Hawaii; Los Angeles International Airport in California;  Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport; Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia; Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey; Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas; and Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Michigan.  So, I think what you are missing from the 7 to 11 is the last four.  Washington Dulles, Newark, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Detroit Metropolitan.  The next question you asked is how many people are currently under quarantine?  Right now, today in the United States, only 195 individuals are currently under quarantine.  There is nobody else quarantined for novel coronavirus.  When these flights arrive, we will have more concrete numbers of the number of individuals that are being quarantined and we’ll provide that.  We have a general estimate, but I don’t think we will have a completely accurate number until those flights land in the United States.  And that’s expected to be this week.  So, for that large number I don’t have it today, but we’ll provide it.  As many of you have hypothesized, and we agree, with the closing of Wuhan on the 21st and Hubei on the 24th, the number of travelers coming out of either of those locations should be trailing off.  And given that we are talking about quarantine for 14 days from the time that you left Hubei, we are rapidly getting to the end of that cycle, and, therefore, we expect the number of individuals to fit within that quarantine requirement to be decreasing.  I will pass along the question of how we can or will be releasing those numbers.  I actually don’t know that we have come to a conclusion about that yet.  But understand why you want to know.  Did I miss anything?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:   Oh, and China offer.  What I can say is that we have folks ready to go to China as soon as that offer is finalized.  I understand that there still are negotiations in process on that.  And really, we are just waiting.  As soon as we are allowed to go, we will be there.  And, you know, we do have an expert already in the field as part of CDC’s continuing work with China.  So, he’s already in the field and therefore could be there immediately.  So, we are still waiting for that invitation.  And I don’t have anything more to say on that.
Benjamin Haynes:   Next question, please, Michelle.
Operator:  Richard Harris from NPR.  You may go ahead.
Richard Harris:  Thanks very much.  Good morning.  Can you tell us about the health situation, health condition of the 11 people?  Is anyone seriously ill?  Some of the anecdotes we’ve heard is that people seem to get the virus and have shrugged it off pretty quickly.  But I’m not sure if that speaks to all 11 or how nasty this disease is.  Thanks for that question.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:   As many of you know we have declined to speak directly about the health of the individuals because that is it really something that should be coming from the State – The State health departments who have the best knowledge, and also their own requirements what they want to share.  I can tell you we have seen a spectrum of illness among cases in the U.S. some of them seem pretty mild.  At least a few have at least some point in the course of their illness been more severely ill.  And there have been some ups and downs in the course of these patients that are sicker.  I would note that there are no deaths in the United States.  Some of our patients have had oxygen requirements during the course of their illness.  There is the first death outside China now reported.  And the data coming out of China continues to say that the people who are higher risk for severe disease and death are those who are older and with underlying health conditions.  And so, obviously, we’ll need to wait and hope that we don’t see that level of that here in the United States.  Our clinical folks working on everything we can do to make sure those patients get the optimal care we can provide for them.
Benjamin Haynes:   Next question, please.
Operator:  Leonard Bernstein from Washington Post, you may go ahead.
Leonard Bernstein:  Thanks for taking my question.  Dr. Messonnier, if somebody or multiple people meet the criteria for quarantine coming into those 11 airports, where are you going to put them?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:   Yeah.  So, the discussions about where those patients will go is a conversation that CDC has been having actively with State and local health departments as well as with after at each of those 11 locations.  So, with the Federal partners and the State and local partners, we are working through operational plans that might be slightly different for every one of those locations depending on how much preparation they have done, whether they already have sites identified, where they are.  So, in each of those locations it might be slightly different, but you know I think we are making good progress on a plan, and my compliments to our State and local partners.  Because we are all in this together with them, and we appreciate their flexibility, their willingness to work through this with us on an incredibly tight time line and coming up together for plans.  We want to make sure these people are comfortable but also, that they are safe, and their families and communities are safe.
Leonard Bernstein:  Well, if I might follow up.  Could you give us some examples?  Are we talking about military bases?  Are we talking about FEMA trailers?  Are we talking about hotels?  What are the options?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:   All of those things might be options.  I think for some specific locations, military bases are close by.  For others, states have actually already themselves made plans for hotels as part of their own operational planning.  Again, as we talked about, part of pandemic planning that we and our state and local partners have been involved in for a dozen years, this was one of the contingencies we have been planning for, so some States had already gone pretty well down there thinking about what to do.  So, no options off the table, and it is very localized depending on the State and local considerations.
Benjamin Haynes:   Michele, we have time for two more questions.
Operator:  Thank you.  Julie Steenhuysen from Reuters.  You may go ahead.
Julie Steenhuysen:  Yes, thanks.  So earlier you mentioned that a lot of these quarantines were science based.  United States has been criticized by China directly, which is saying that we are sort of banning the fears about this virus.  And our quarantines do seem to be outside of the w.h.o.  recommendations.  Can you explain what the science base decision making or how these decisions are made based on what particular science?  Thanks.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:   What I would say is this is an unprecedented situation and we have taken aggressive measures.  A couple of weeks ago there were 41 cases in China.  This morning the numbers are 17,000.  17,000 cases with a novel virus, novel coronavirus that the population doesn’t have immunity to, and for which, because things have been moving so quickly, we don’t have the information base that we want.  As I said, largely expanding outbreak; person-to-person and community transmission in China.  Deaths inside China, and now a death outside of China.  Concerning data suggesting that people who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic may be transmitting the disease. All of those are worrisome data points.  This is an aggressive action by the United States, but our goal is to slow this thing down.  We have the opportunity to slow it down before it gets into the United States, and we felt scientifically our recommendation was that if we acted now, we did have the opportunity to provide additional protection to the United States and Americans.  We made an aggressive decision in front of an unprecedented threat that action now would slow this down, and action now has the biggest potential to slow this thing down.  And that’s what the theory is here.  And other countries are making different decisions, but I would say that multiple countries are also taking pretty aggressive actions.  And, importantly, the Chinese themselves are taking very aggressive actions in their own country to try to slow the thing down.
Benjamin Haynes:  Last question, please.
Operator:  Thank you.  Sarah Owermohle from Politico.  You may go ahead.
Sarah Owermohle:  Hi, yes, I’m kind of on the lines of the last question, Chinese authority this morning was expressing a lot of frustration with the U.S.  response saying that you were overreacting and spreading panic.  Do you think that jeopardizes CDC’s place in the WHO  mission that you are still planning?  Or I mean are you looking to talk through that with Chinese officials?  Also, separately, you mentioned at the beginning of the call the status for diagnostic tests and I wanted to clarify.  You are expediting the EUA?
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:   I’ll answer the second one first because it’s easier.  The process is extremely expedited and our colleagues with FDA have been looking at this closely since we made the plan, that we were going to do this in in way.  So, our plans were submitted to them today and I expect that that means that we should be able to start that by the end of the week, barring complications.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier:   In terms of the first question, let me start by saying that this is a horrible situation in China.  There is a huge number of cases.  There is lots of disruption in their communities and society both from the illness and from the measures that they’ve taken to try to slow the spread.  So, our hearts go out to those individuals who are suffering through this.  I think that we at CDC have incredibly strong scientists who have a lot of technical experience in really similar diseases as well as in these kinds of diseases.  And our presence on the ground in China would be a help to folks in China who are trying to unravel the thing and make the best recommendations possible for their country and the world.  And certainly, what I’ve seen in situations like this, science should trump everything else.  And that’s certainly what we are hoping is that scientific expertise of the larger global community will be able to be brought to bear on this really complicated difficult situation that our colleagues in China are dealing with.
Benjamin Haynes:  Thank you, Dr. Messonnier.  Thank you for joining us for today’s update.  Please remember to check out CDC’s 2019 novel coronavirus website for latest updates.  And if you have further questions, please call the main media line, 404.639.3286, or email media@cdc.gov.

>> Thank you, Sheila and thank you, everybody, for joining us for the release of today’s final 2018 mortality data for the U.S.  With are joined by dr. Jennifer Madans, the acting director of the CDC national center for health statistics, as well as Dr. Robert Anderson, the chief of the mortality statistics branch of NCHS.  The data we are discussing today are featured in several new NCHS reports which are now publicly available on the NCHS website.  Without further ado, I will now turn the call over to dr.  Madans.
>> Thanks, Jeff.  Let me thank you all for joining us this afternoon so we can discuss some of the results of the 2018 final mortality release, as Jeff said, the final file was posted on our website today and along with it six reports.  Three of those reports will address maternal mortality and changes in the coding and classification in maternal mortality.  One of the reports talks about the general mortality findings and general trends in the top tier mortality indicators.  Another looks at drug overdose and a third looks at changes in life expectancy.  All of these reports are using the final 2018 data.  We have released some more recent data through our provisional quarterly releases, that covers many of the topics that we’ll be talking about today, but our provisional data on overall mortality and also by leading causes, so and also drug overdose and also monthly counts of drug overdoses so I encourage to you check our website for those, for more recent data.  All of the reports we’re talking about today are on the website and I just wanted to also mention that this is our first release for 2018, the first set of reports, but we will be releasing additional reports based on the 2018 data in the month to come, and as I know many of you know, there is a schedule release so you can look and see what’s coming up when you get a four-week notice when we’re going to be releasing data.  I’m going to turn this over to Bob.
>> All right.  Thanks, Jennifer.  So, I’m just going to talk a little bit about general mortality and leading causes of death.  We’ll move to drug overdoses for a few minutes and talk about life expectancy, and then then we’ll talk about maternal mortality a bit.  So before I start with the day and talking about the data, I wanted to mention that the data that we’re using here, this mortality data from the national vital statistics system, it comes from death certificates that are filed in state, I also want to mention that vital registration is a state function, not a federal function, so it is governed by state laws and regulations, and we have a federal/state collaborative relationship with them, where we provide some funding and coordination of standards, and the states  maintain autonomy in their operations but they collect data according to standard specs and agreed-upon time lines.  So, with regard to overall mortality, overall mortality declined by 1.1% from 2017 to 2018.  We also saw declines in the major demographic groups.  We saw declines for non-Hispanic white males and white females, non-Hispanic black females and Hispanic females.  The rates for non-Hispanic black males and Hispanic males did not change significantly.  Ten leading causes of death remain the same as in 2017.  The ten leading causes overall accounted for about 74% of all deaths in the united states.  We saw declines in six of the ten leading causes of death and increases for two.  The others didn’t change significantly.  The notable ones here are unintentional injuries which declined after increasing for almost a decade.  The increases and the decrease that we saw were largely driven by increases and a decrease in drug overdose mortality, which we’ll talk about in a minute, and suicide mortality continued to increase.  It’s been increasing since the year 2000 and what we see today at 14.2 deaths per 100,000 population is the largest death rate since 1941.  Drug overdose death rates have been increasing over the last several years.  It would be hard to miss that headline.  In 2018, there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths in the united states.  That’s 4.1% fewer than in 2017, when it was 70,237.  So, in terms of the rate, the drug overdose death rate at 20.7 was 4.6% lower than the rate in 2017.  With regard to specific drugs, including drugs like oxy codone and hydrocodone, we saw declines for heroin and methadone, and we saw continued increases for the synthetic opioids other than methadone, which is mostly fentanyl and we also saw increases in deaths involving cocaine and category called psychostimulants with abuse potential which is mostly methamphetamine.  We saw also increases in the suicide rate, as i mentioned before, it’s been increasing since 2000.  We saw increases for males and females and by various demographic groups and those increases are continuing into 2018.  With regard to life expectancy, life expectancy at birth increased from 2017 to 2018 by a tenth of the year from 78.6 to 78.7, and to put this in a little further context, if we go back to 2010, we see the life expectancy in that year was also 78.7.  It rose by two-tenths of the year to 78.9 in 2014 and then we saw a period of declining life expectancy from 2014 to 2017.  From 78.9 to 78.1 and 0.1 of a year increase from 2017 to 2018.  Just to focus in a little bit on the 14 to 17 decline, largely due to increases in unintentional injury mortality, mostly drug overdose and also suicide.  The one-tenth of a year increase in life expectancy from 2017 to 2018 was largely driven by declines in the cancer mortality, and in unintentional injury, unintentional injuries shifted back to a decline and that again was mostly a decline in drug overdose deaths.  So now Jennifer did mention that we have some provisional data as well that allows us to reach in to 2019 up through June of 2019, and so I’d encourage you to go on to our website and check out that information.  It’s very interesting particularly with regard to the drug overdose deaths.  One thing that we’re seeing is the drug overdose deaths don’t appear to be — the decline doesn’t appear to be continuing in 2019.  It appears rather flat and may be actually increasing a little bit.  With regard to maternal mortality, just by way of background, I do want to mention we suspended publication of maternal mortality rates in 2007, and we’re resuming now after more than a decade, and the main reason why we had suspended publication in 2007 was that we had some serious concerns about the data quality, and how all of that was working.  I also want to mention that we use at NCHS the WHO  definition of a maternal death, which focuses in on the period during pregnancy and up to 42 days outside of pregnancy.  You know, that said, we do compile additional information, we go beyond the 42 days up to one year.  One thing that we noticed is that before 2003, the research showed underreporting of maternal death in vital statistics and as a result sop states introduced pregnancy check box stats to capture a recent pregnancy but there was a lack of standardization among the death certificates.  It was decided when we revised the U.S. death certificate the revision scheduled for 2003, we’d add a standard pregnancy check box item and recommend that for use in all of the states.  The cause of death section on the death certificate, the cause of death is basically determined by what is written in the cause of death field.  For maternal death we take into account not just what’s written in the cause of death section, but we also take into account the check box.  So, the check box item is really designed to help us identify additional deaths involving pregnancy and also to give us a sense for what the timing was post pregnancy.  We have this new standard certificate with a standard pregnancy check box item.  It was supposed to be implemented in all states in 2003.  That was the original plan.  Unfortunately, not all states implemented in 2003.  Actually, only five did in 2003, and those were implemented gradually over time.  The final state implemented the new standard certificate and the pregnancy check box in the year 2017 and so now in 2018 we have all states that have a check box item and so here we are prepared to report maternal mortality rate again.  But you know, before I mention, before we talk about the data itself, I want to mention that we spend a fair amount of time evaluating the effect of the pregnancy check box and that evaluation showed a fairly large increase in the number of maternal deaths we were able to identify, and this actually very quite largely by age, the older ages we identified even more than we might have otherwise.  We also, as we were working on the evaluation, identified some research that had been done on the pregnancy check box that showed that there were errors in the check box.  Just to give you an idea, in 2013 we found 147 cases of female deaths ages 85 and over that were flagged using the pregnancy check box at the time of death or recently pregnant which of course is completely unrealistic.  So, we also had to take into account not only the increasing maternal deaths that were being identified over the period but also this issue of errors in check box.  So, at the older ages because of errors in check box, we didn’t feel like we could really, that we could rely solely on the check box.  So, in the absence of explicit evidence of pregnancy or pregnancy related condition, in the cause of death section of the death certificate, we’ve not used the check box for decedents aged 55 and older.  The results of our evaluation showed the errors are fairly prevalent in even younger ages, and so we decided we needed to restrict the application check box further, so we’ve done that for decedents 45 and over.  So, with our new coding method and the new data we have, we are making this additional restriction with regard to the check box.  We’re restricting the ages from 10 to 44, where we apply the check box information, and that said, we do count maternal deaths at those older ages, so if there is a mention of an obstetric condition or pregnancy complication cause of death section, we count it as maternal death regardless of age.  Where the check box is the only evidence, we don’t use it for ages 45 and over.  So, let me just walk you quickly through the major findings with regard to maternal mortality.  Our new method results in a rate of 17.4 deaths per 100,000 live births.  This varies quite a lot by race and Hispanic origin.  Non-Hispanic black women are two and a half times more likely to die than non-Hispanic white women.  Hispanic women have about 80% of the white race.  In terms of age, at ages 40 and over, the rate is five times that for those in the age range 25 to 39.  Those under 25 have about two-thirds the risk of maternal mortality.  And we do have some difficulty assessing trends.  We can’t really work backwards with the new method because of the incremental implementation of the check box.  Even with the new method, we can’t correct for the fact that states are as they implement the check box item, that they’re getting more deaths.  So, we have a real problem with that.  So the best we can do really is to compare rates, assuming that the check box wasn’t there at all, and those rates are much lower, but they’re at least comparable across time, and so when we compare 2002 before implementation of the check box and 2018, assuming that the check box didn’t exist in 2002, the rate was 8.9 per 100,000 live births and 2018 is 8.7 per 100,000 live births.  It’s really very little change there at all.  Actually, I think the change is not statistically significant at all.  Now I do want to contrast that 8.7 rate with the 17.4 rate using the new method.  So, using the new method, the risk of dying is actually about double what it was without accounting for the check box.  One more thing you wanted to mention is that we are planning to continue our work in this area, to continue to try to better understand why these errors are occurring, and to figure out some ways to sort of solve those errors.  We have some ideas on how to do that.  We’re also looking to work with the state vital records office, state maternal and child health agencies in order to better identify these deaths and determine whether they’re pregnancy related.  Obviously, we need to make sure all this information gets back into the vital statistics system so we can accurately count the deaths.  And I will — oh, one other thing that I do want to mention is that we do have a website devoted to maternal mortality reports and products, and there all of these issues are summarized.  There are links to all the reports.  There’s frequently asked questions, a whole lot of great information.  So, we’ll stop there.
>> Okay.  Thank you, Dr. Anderson.  Sheila, I believe we are ready for questions, please.
>> Thank you.  We will now begin the question and answer session.  If you would like to ask a question, please press star one, unmute your phone and record your name clearly.  If you need to withdraw your question, press star two.  Again, to ask a question, please press star one.  Our first question will come from Dan Vergano with BuzzFeed news, your line is open.
>> Thanks very much.  I have two questions.  The first is in your discussion about the preliminary data and what it says about drug overdoses, can you characterize what it’s telling you are the increases in stimulant deaths overpowering the drop in heroin and pain killers or is fentanyl just rocketing upwards?  The second question is, will this data go into the wonder database?  It will it be updated to 2018?
>> Let me address the second question first.  Yes, it will.  We had hoped to have that ready today.  Unfortunately, due to some staffing issues, it’s not ready, and I’m not entirely sure when it will be ready.
>> It would be great to know when that happens.
>> Right.  Well, we’ll, we’re monitoring the situation and like i said we hope to have it up as quickly as possible.  With regard to the other question, it’s really difficult to tell exactly what’s driving the pattern into 2019.  We have about half of 2019 available at this point.  We have data through June 2019, and we do have information on the specific drugs.  One of the issues that we struggle with a bit is that often — well, there are actually more of these drug deaths that involve multiple drugs than there are that involve a single drug.  So, you may have really common combination we see in the data is fentanyl mixed with cocaine or fentanyl mixed with methamphetamine.  It makes it difficult to decide what is exactly driving the pattern.  The synthetic opioids are continuing — deaths due to synthetic opioids like fentanyl are continuing to increase into 2019, and we’re seeing increases similarly with cocaine and the psychostimulants with abuse potential, the methamphetamine deaths.
>> Thanks very much.
>> Thank you.  As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question at this time, you can press star one on your phone and record your name when prompted.  Our next question comes from Beth Mole with Ars Technica.
>> Thanks for holding the conference and taking my question.  I’m a little confused about the overdose data from 2017 and 2018 and what’s driving the decrease.  So, it looks like from the data charts that there’s about 2,870 fewer deaths in 2018 from 2017 but those don’t seem to be explained by the drops in the opioid deaths and the increases by, in cocaine and psychostimulant deaths.  There’s only a decrease of 798 opioid deaths and increase of 724 cocaine deaths and 2,343 psychostimulant deaths.  Is there another category of drug overdoses that are driving the overall decline?
>> Part of the problem trying to interpret the data that way is the issue of multidrug toxicity.  The categories aren’t additive.  So, there’s a lot of overlap between these categories, so a death may be actually counted in multiple categories, two or more in many instances.  So, it makes it really difficult to partition the decline in sort of using an additive method.  We really don’t have a good handle on how best to do that.
>> Okay, so there aren’t any other categories of drug overdoses that are also seeing significant declines?
>> No, not really.  I mean, the other categories are categories in which there are very, very few deaths overall.
>> You would really have to look at all the combinations of the deaths to parse out where the declines and the increases went, and you know, that’s impossible to do, it’s a lot of categories.
>> Thank you so much.
>> We are showing no further questions at this time.  But again, if you would like to ask a question, you can press star one on your phone and record your name when prompted.  One moment, please, for any additional questions.
>> Okay, without any further questions then, thank you Dr.  Madans and Dr. Anderson for joining us today, as well as reporters and guests.  For any follow-up questions, you can call the NCHS press office at 301-458-4800, or else better still send an email to us at paoquery@cdc.gov.  Thank you for joining us.  This concludes our call.
>> Thank you.  That does conclude today’s conference.  Thank you again for your participation.  You may disconnect at this time."
1587583295-142,https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0228-COVID-19-update.html,"February 28, 2020",CDC,Audio Transcript,Transcript for the CDC Telebriefing Update on COVID-19,"Benjamin Haynes: Thank you all joining us for this briefing. We’re joined today by the director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, Dr. Nancy Messonnier.  At this time Ii will turn the call over.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Good afternoon, thank you for joining us today.  Since I last briefed you, there has been one new case of COVID-19 detected through the U.S. public health system. As has been widely reported, at this time we don’t know how or where this person became infected. This brings the number of confirmed cases of person-to-person spread in the United States to 3.
We also have confirmed 2 more people who have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 among U.S. citizens repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. That brings the total number of people with COVID-19 to 44 among this group of people.
I’d like to share with you some additional information about the U.S. case CDC confirmed on Wednesday. CDC officials first heard from public health colleagues in California about this patient last Sunday, February 23rd. California reported a severely ill person who had not recently traveled abroad or had contact with a known case of COVID-19.  CDC recommended testing for COVID-19 that day. We received samples on February 25th and confirmed the results with public health officials in California the day they were finalized, on February 26th. As I said, the patient’s exposure is unknown.  It’s possible this could be the first instance of community spread – meaning the illness was acquired through an unknown exposure in the community. It’s also possible, however, that a thorough investigation may show that the patient had exposure through contact to a returned traveler who was infected.
CDC has sent a team to support the California Department of Health and the local health departments in investigating this case.  We are working hard to find and identify how the patient was exposed as well as tracing back people who were exposed or might have been exposed to this patient.  Like you, we are thinking about the wellbeing of this patient, this family, and this community. People who were exposed to this person during their infection are at some level of risk depending on their exposure. Based on what we know about how this virus behaves, we expect that we will find additional people who have had contact with this patient, especially those who have had close, prolonged contact. This of course includes family members and potentially among healthcare workers who cared for the patient.
There has been some confusion about whether this person met CDC’s criteria for testing of COVID-19.
Let me comment briefly on how we have set our PUI criteria, which has been evolving as all of our guidance has to meet the needs of this rapidly evolving situation. You can look for these updates online at www.cdc.gov/covid19.
CDC’s definition of a person under investigation, or PUI, from the beginning has been broad, for travelers especially, because this was a disease that was being introduced from another part of the world. We have been looking for people with fever, cough, or trouble breathing. Fever and cough are pretty broad parameters, especially during flu season, and we’ve had to rule out many people who had other respiratory illnesses.  At this point in our investigation, we are most focused on symptomatic people who are closely linked to confirmed cases or had travel history. But our criteria also allows for clinical discretion.
As public health professionals, we know that there is no substitute for the astute clinician on the frontlines of patient care. Our clinical team working with state and local health departments to assess PUIs has not said no to any request for testing.
So, on the topic of PUIs, I want to say that as we’ve been watching the increased spread of this virus across the world, we have been working with our partners on an updated PUI definition. That was posted online yesterday. The updated PUI definition takes into account the new geographic spread of the virus and includes a list of affected areas with widespread or sustained community spread. This list is dynamic and will change as our travel guidance is revised. I would now like to share an update on our progress to get all state and local public health labs the capacity to test for this virus. That is CDC’s role in testing for this illness. As I’ve said before, this has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.
We have been working simultaneously on a couple of possible solutions and I’m happy to say today that both have delivered.
Right now, labs can start testing with existing CDC test kits. States that were able to validate their kits should continue to test in this manner. States that were able to validate only the two components specific to novel coronavirus can test using only these two using revised instructions developed at CDC. We have established that the third component, which was the cause of the inconclusive results, can be excluded from testing without affecting accuracy. We have been working with FDA and they agree with our approach. While we’re working to amend the existing EUA, we have discretionary authority from FDA to proceed in this manner. This will increase testing capacity at state and local health departments. All positive test results will continue to be confirmed by CDC for some time.
Additionally, CDC has manufactured brand new test kits that will only include the two components that are specific to novel coronavirus.  Those test kits are at the International Reagent Resource, where orders can be placed. We are working as quickly as we can to get CDC test kits to state and local public health authorities. However, during any infectious disease response there is a great need for test manufacturers to rapidly make testing available in clinics, in hospitals, and at the bedside.  This is part of a huge effort within the US government led by HHS.
States will now start testing for this virus. You may start hearing from states directly. As always, their case counts will be the most up-to-date. CDC will continue to report case counts on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Our priority continues to be getting accurate diagnostic capacity—and doing so quickly—because we know public health surveillance is critical to our fight against this novel coronavirus. To date, our strategies have been largely successful.  As a result, we have very few cases in the United States.  And while we may be confronting the first instance of community spread, we are working very hard with our state and local public health partners to find out more.
I want to recognize that people are concerned about this situation. We appreciate that Americans are taking this threat seriously and continuing to seek information about how to be prepared. As always, President Trump’s and our number one priority is the health and safety of the American people. Our mission includes providing you with clear information that allows you to make decisions about how best to protect yourself and your family.
While the immediate risk to the general American public remains low, and the U.S. government is doing everything we can to keep it low. CDC is constantly monitoring what is happening abroad. Our guidelines and advice are likely to be interim and subject to change as we learn more. We will continue to keep you updated.
I would be happy to take questions now.
Haynes: We’re ready to open up for questions.
Operator: If you would like to ask a question please press star 1. Record your name, if you would like to withdraw your question, press star 2. Please wait a moment while we way for questions to queue. Our first question comes from Helen Branswell, your line is now open.
Helen Branswell: Now that test kits — state and local labs can test more broadly, how soon will you be able to get the surveillance project that you were talking about earlier with the six cities up and running?
Dr. Messonnier: Thank you for that question.  It is increasingly important to be able to do not just surveillance focused on the PUIs, but broader community level surveillance.  And we’re moving rapidly to go from those six sights to national surveillance.  We expect the first site to do testing by next week and we hope to be able to rapidly move from six to all 50 states.  This is part of a layered approach with that first component that you’re talking about but multiple other systems that we’re modifying.  we can modify them to be able to also test for this coronavirus.
Haynes: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stein at NPR.
Rob Stein: Could you be a little more specific on the testing? How many states are testing now? How many states do you think will be testing let’s say next week, and sort of what is the timeline that you’re projecting for that?
Dr. Messonnier: I’m not going to give a specific number because throughout the day today we expect additional states to stand up and we expect that to be happening for the next week. Our goal is to have every state and local health department online doing their own testing by the end of next weekend and doing everything we can to continue that.
Haynes: Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Cohen at CNN, your line is open.
Elizabeth Cohen: Thank you for taking my question. When the CDC and the local state departments have been doing contact tracing, are they tracing contacts while they were symptomatic, or only while they were asymptomatic but presumably infected? And has that been the system the entire time or is that a new policy or was that the old policy?
Dr. Messonnier: Because there have been such a small number of cases in the United States, CDC has  been able to supplement the activities of the state and local health departments, to be very aggressive in our contact tracing, that is true from the first case and it remains true now.  We have been broad in terms of our evaluations of the potential contacts of cases, and I remind you that so far before this most recent case all but two of our cases were travelers, and the two cases we had that were person to person spread were quite close contacts of cases, they were spouses. While we have been aggressive and broad where we have found those cases were actually in very close contacts.
Reporter Issam Ahmed at AFP: Hi, thank you for this.  About what you were saying about the California patient, it seems to be at odds with what Representative Berra (?) said in Congress yesterday, he said the patient was brought in on the 19th of February, and it wasn’t until five days – and doctors immediately asked for a test, and it wasn’t until Sunday the 23rd that federal authorities agreed to do that test.  I was wondering if you could speak to that? And another question is that given the US situation with its public health system with 27.5 million people uninsured, do you think that this could be a problem if it takes root in this community and spread and people will be reluctant to approach their health care providers because of the cost involved?  Thank you.
Dr. Messonnier: According to CDC records, the first call we got about this patient was on Sunday, February 23rd.  The second question is we need to remember that right now the case count in the United States is really low and that is a reflection of the aggressive containment efforts of the US government. There is certainly the possibility of additional cases. We will continue to work aggressively to try to keep that number low. The spread we hope will be limited, and any disease in the U.S. will be mild, our focus on public health is on those issues.
Haynes: Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig at KNX CBS. Your line is now open.
Reporter: You talk about the case count being low, how do we reconcile that with the fact that here in California the most populous state, the governor yesterday said only a couple hundred testing kits.  The case count will be low because it sounds like there is not enough tests that could reflect it.  It seems like the issue the math on that seems to be a low count.
Dr. Messonnier: Yes, thank you for the opportunity to talk about that. We need to remember that this situation is taken place rapidly.  By far the majority of cases have been in California.  A few weeks ago we found an increase in cases around the world.  And again this week we have seen an increase in cases globally.  Because of the aggressive U.S. efforts at our border strategy the number of cases have been low.  And we have been able to focus our efforts on travelers and their close contact based on our evaluation of who is at highest risk.  We will continue to modify our approach.  In terms of diagnostic testing, additional labs are coming on-line and additional test kits are on their way now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michelle Cortez, at Bloomberg News, your line is now open.
Michelle Cortez: I think what a lot of us are grappling with a little bit is the idea that China has been able to do tens of thousands of tests. Korea has been able to do thousands of tests. And here in the US,  in our local we have done about 500 in our local patients and then plus another 2,000 patients or so that have been repatriated — we just don’t have the numbers they do.  Can you explain that to us how others aer able to do thousands and thousands of tests, that we have not been able to do that yet?
Dr. Messonnier: I think there are two answers to that question. One is that the epidemiological situation in China and other countries is really different from the U.S. We acted incredibly quickly before most other countries. Aggressively controlled our borders and we were able to slow the spread into the United States.  That was an intentional US strategy with the goal of allowing us to control our efforts, so we have focused surveillance for those at highest risk. And again, that is why the number of patients that were identified as PUIs in the US has been smaller. I guess i would also direct you back, the CDC role was in rapidly developing a diagnostic and focusing on the front line on getting that out to the public.  But our solution, a larger part of the any such infectious disease is getting the test kit out more broadly to the hospitals, and to the HHS and to the front lines, and that is part of a U.S. government strategy that is a huge priority with HHS leadership right now.  CDC has always had the capacity to test from the time rapidly when the sequence was available and that is two labs at the CDC doing the testing, and we have been testing aggressively the patients that state health departments have referred to us.
Reporter Mike Stobbe, AP: Hi, thank you for taking my call.  You mentioned is there are two new cases from the Diamond Princess, can you tell us about them and where they are and can you tell us more about the testing, why was three needed in the first place and was there problems with one of the other two?  I heard reports that might have been the case. And finally in the change of the testing criteria, are there potential downsides to that?  Thank you.
Dr. Messonnier: First question, those are two additional cases among the U.S. are repatriated, that can be available on our website. In terms of three to two, please remember that our laboratories developed this test kit before there were US cases.  We developed it based on the posted genetic sequencing, and it was this test kit that allowed us, to identify the first cases in the United States.  As more cases have been identified and more cases have been available it is clear that two of the three reactions, we actually are appropriately sensitive and specific in identifying cases.  That is why after being able to share that data with FDA, they agreed and there is a new protocol, and that’s what we’re talking about when we’re talking about the change from three to two. In terms of
we signed that that is what we’re talking about.  In terms of test criteria, I think you’re referring to the PUI definition. What I would say about that is that the situation has evolved and it continues to evolve very quickly and therefore we need to continue to evolve our PUI definition.  This is not something that we take lightly.  We take ramifications from this.  That is why any such decision involves not just CDC, but all of our local and state health departments and partners who have a stake in this, and we’ll see the impact of it.  It was certainly not a decision we made without a lot of consultation. Our goal is and remains to do everything we can to help the American people.
Haynes: We have time for two more questions, please.
Operator: Okay, next we have a question from Laura Johnson at CBN News.
Laura Johnson:  I was wondering what is your reaction to the fact that the new cases in China have been lower if many days in a row and the death rate outside of China is lower than inside of China, and what is your opinion of the anti-viral medication remdesivir as a possible treatment and also the possibility of immune-therapy drugs as possible treatments.  Thank you.
Dr. Messonnier: Thank you, I think it is really good news that the case counts in China are decreasing.  We’re watching that closely and we hope that is a trend that continues both for the good of the citizens in China who have been through quite an outbreak, and also in the hopes that it will help us learn what we can better do in the United States to continue to control it right here.  In terms of the case fatality ratio, I think there is a whole bunch of data from China and from other countries around the world on the ratios, and there is a variety of mathematical models that are looking at that data, and hoping that it will — and working together to better understand it and use it to better analyze what we might expect elsewhere including in the United States. What I can say is that in the U.S. our cases have been doing very well.  We will continue to do everything we can.  They have a product that has been used in some of these cases.  It is something that NIH has been going for and those questions are better answered by NIH.
Haynes: Last question, please.
Operator: Our last question comes from Roni Rabin from New York Times.
Roni Rabin: If states are able to do these testing, they still need to have a confirmatory test by the CDC, does that mean there is a 48-hour delay for the patient getting that information?  And can you comment on the whistleblower report and tell us what kind of precautions were taken and was CDC involved in the visits to Travis Air Force Base.  I also want to know how often you’ll hold these briefings, Can you give us a regular schedule?
Dr. Messonnier: Thank you for actually allowing me to sort of speak specifically about this issue.  Which is that there are procedures that we’re working through with the states and FDA in terms of confirmatory testing.  More important than the confirmatory language, is what is actionable from a public health perspective at a state and local health department. So it is possible, for example, that there might be presumptive positives that are waiting confirmation, but others which state and local health departments will be able to take action and that is what is most important and we’re working through those labels now and we’ll have more information as we figure out that piece.  In terms of the whistle-blower investigation, let me say that CDC takes the health and safety of our employees very seriously.  We’re aware of the HHS whistle-blower complaint, but I defer any other questions on this matter to HHS.  And in terms of the telebriefings, we will continue to routinely provide information when we can.
Haynes: Thank you all for joining us from today’s briefing, please check the CDC.gov/COVID19 website.  If you have more questions please call the media line 404-639-3286 or e-mail media @cdc.gov.  Thank you."
